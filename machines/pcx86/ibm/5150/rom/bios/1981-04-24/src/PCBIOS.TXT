IBM PC BIOS dated 04/24/81 is 5940 lines based on the BIOS listings in the IBM PC Technical Reference dated August 1981.
The BIOS was likely built using the Intel ASM86 Macro Assembler V1.0.

Notes to build with MASM 1 to 4:

Line 1:    $TITLE(ROM BIOS FOR IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER)
           to build with MASM remove the '$'
Line 193:  CODE SEGMENT AT 0F000H
           to build with MASM and LINK remove the 'AT 0F000H'
           LINK will not generate code for 'AT address' segments
Line 539:  JMP TST6
           MASM generates EB 2B 90 while the BIOS has E9 2A 00
Line 647:  JMP TST8
           MASM generates EB 37 90 while the BIOS has E9 36 00
Line 944:  JMP TST12
           MASM generates EB 4B 90 while the BIOS has E9 4A 00
Line 2511: MOV SI,OFFSET J17
           to match the BIOS (BE F3 ED 90) add an extra NOP after this line
           the original assembler generated an extra NOP due to the forward reference
Line 5936: JMP RESET
           MASM generates a near jump instead of a far jump
           also LINK will not generate code for 'AT address' segments

LINK will generate an .EXE file with 22 relocations. These are due to references to the CODE segment and should be F000.
Unfortunately EXE2BIN will not process the EXE file as it has more than 65278 bytes of code.

The BIOS code ends at FFD9, the bytes from FFDA to FFEF should be padded with FF.

The VECTOR segment data should be entered at FFF0 as follows:
EA 5B E0 00 F0 30 34 2F 32 34 2F 38 31 FF FF EB

IBM PC BIOS version 3 (10/27/82)

IBM PC BIOS dated 10/27/82 is 6207 lines based on the BIOS listings in the IBM PC Technical Reference dated April 1984.
The BIOS was likely built using the Intel ASM86 Macro Assembler V2.0.

This BIOS must be built with ASM86, several operand constructs are used which MASM does not recognize.

Line 224:  CODE SEGMENT AT 0F000H
           to build with LINK remove the 'AT 0F000H'
           LINK will not generate code for 'AT address' segments

LINK will generate an .EXE file with 1 relocation. This is due to a far jump to segment F000.
Unfortunately EXE2BIN will not process the EXE file as it has more than 65278 bytes of code.

The VECTOR segment data should be entered at FFF0 as follows:
EA 5B E0 00 F0 31 30 2F 32 37 2F 38 32 FF FF 77
