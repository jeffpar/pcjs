 * to inhibit hardware interrupts following SS segment loads).
 *
 * This does NOT enable what must be regarded as 8086 "features", such as failing to properly restart string
 * instructions with multiple prefixes after a hardware interrupt, which we simulate regardless, because some software

 * to choose any block size for physical memory allocations that made sense for the bus width (eg, 4Kb blocks for a
 * 20-bit bus, or 16Kb blocks for a 24-bit bus).
 *
 * However, for the 80386 processor, it makes more sense to choose a block size that matches the page size (ie, 4Kb),
 * because then we have the option of altering the address-to-memory mapping for any block to match whatever page table
 * mapping is in effect for that address, if any, without requiring another layer of address translation.
