     * The FDC component simulates a NEC ÂµPD765A or Intel 8272A compatible floppy disk controller, and has one
     * component-specific property:
     *
     *      autoMount: one or more JSON-encoded objects, each containing 'name' and 'path' properties
     *      diskettes: an array of DiskImage objects, or the name of a JSON file containing disk descriptors
     *      server: name of the diskette server, if any
     *      drives: an array of DriveType objects, each containing 'heads', 'tracks', and 'boot' properties
     *      sortBy: "name" to sort disks by name, "path" to sort by path, or "none" to leave as-is (default is "name")
     *
     * Regarding early diskette drives: the IBM PC Model 5150 originally shipped with single-sided drives,
     * and therefore supported only 160Kb diskettes.  That's the only diskette format PC-DOS 1.00 supported, too.
     *
     * At some point, 5150's started shipping with double-sided drives, but I'm not sure whether the ROMs changed;
     * they probably did NOT change, because the original ROM BIOS already supported drives with multiple heads.
     * However, what the ROM BIOS did NOT do was provide any indication of drive type, which as far as I can tell,
     * meant you had to simply read/write/format tracks with the second head and check for errors.
     *
     * Presumably at the same time double-sided drives started shipping, PC-DOS 1.10 shipped, which added
     * support for 320Kb diskettes.  And the FORMAT command changed as well, defaulting to a double-sided format
     * operation UNLESS you specified "FORMAT /1".  If I run PC-DOS 1.10 and try to simulate a single-sided drive
     * (by setting drive.nHeads = 1 in initDrive), FORMAT will balk with "Track 0 bad - disk unusable".  I have to
     * wonder if everyone with single-sided drives who upgraded to PC-DOS 1.10 also got that error, forcing them
     * to always specify "FORMAT /1", or if I'm doing something wrong wrt single-sided drive simulation.
     *
     * I've noticed that if I turn FDC messages on ("m fdc on"), and then run "FORMAT B:/1", the command still
     * tries to format head 1/track 0, followed by head 0/track 0, and then the FDC is reset, and the format operation
     * proceeds with only head 0 for all tracks 0 through 39.  FORMAT successfully creates a 160Kb single-sided diskette,
     * but why it also tries to initially format track 0 using the second head remains a bit of a mystery.

         * awaiting their first FDC command.  We do this because the initial SENSE_INT command returns a PCN, which will also
         * be undefined unless we have at least zeroed both the current drive and the "present" cylinder on that drive.
         *
         * Alternatively, I could make PCN a global FDC variable.  That may be closer to how the actual hardware operates,
         * but I'm using per-drive variables so that the FDC component can be a good client to both the CPU and other components.
         *
         * COMPATIBILITY ALERT: The MODEL_5170 BIOS ("DSKETTE_SETUP") attempts to discern the drive type (double-density vs.
         * high-capacity) by "slapping" the heads around -- literally (it uses a constant named "TRK_SLAP" equal to 48).
         * After seeking to "TRK_SLAP", the BIOS performs a series of seeks, looking for the precise point where the heads
         * return to track 0.
         *
         * Here's how it works: the BIOS seeks to track 48 (which is fine on an 80-track 1.2Mb high-capacity drive, but 9 tracks
         * too far on a 40-track 360Kb double-density drive), then seeks to track 10, and then seeks in single-track increments
         * up to 10 more times until the SENSE_DRIVE command returns ST3 with the TRACK0 bit set.
         *
         * This implies that SEEK isn't really seeking to a specified cylinder, but rather it is calculating a delta from
         * the previous cylinder to the specified cylinder, and stepping over that number of tracks.  Which means that SEEK
         * is updating a "logical" cylinder number, not the "physical" (actual) cylinder number.  Presumably a RECALIBRATE
         * command will bring the logical and physical values into sync, but once an out-of-bounds cylinder is requested, they
         * will be out of sync.
         *
         * To simulate this, bCylinder is now treated as the "physical" cylinder (since that's how it's ALWAYS been used here),
         * and bCylinderSeek will now track (pun intended) the "logical" cylinder that's programmed via SEEK commands.

     * getDiskList(controlDrives)
     *
     * In "the old days", the HTML control containing the list of all available diskettes was stored in:
     *
     *      this.bindings["listDisks"]
     *
     * and it still is.  But now, if the HDC component decides to overload our drive list with one or more
     * of its own drives (eg, "CD"), then our drive/diskette controls must be thought of as general-purpose
     * "Removable Media" controls that the FDC just happens to manage for historical reasons.  This avoids
     * cluttering the UI with multiple drop-downs when there are multiple types of removable disk drives.
     *
     * To detect that situation, the name of the selected drive must be checked against the list of external
     * drives, and if there's a match, then we "swap" the disks control normally used by the FDC with the one
     * provided by the HDC; similarly, if there's no longer a match BUT externalActive is set, when we know
     * that a swap is still active and that we must "unswap" them, putting the FDC's original diskette control
     * back in place.
     *
     * TODO: It would be nice to generalize this someday, and support separate diskette lists for separate
     * diskette drive types; for example, if a machine wants to have a 1.2Mb floppy drive for A: and a 360Kb
     * or 1.44Mb floppy drive for B:, it would be nice to have the diskettes segregated by type as well.
     * The FDC will try to alert you whenever you attempt to mount a diskette in a drive that can't support it,
     * but it would be even better if those diskette images weren't listed for that drive in the first place.

         * ie, FD360 (40-track) or FD1200 (80-track).  So if there are two drives, the last selected drive will be drive 1.
         * Immediately before booting, the BIOS issues an INT 0x13/AH=0 reset, which writes regOutput two times: first
         * with FDC.REG_OUTPUT.ENABLE clear, and then with it set.  However, both times, it ALSO loads the last selected
         * drive number into regOutput's "drive select" bits.
         *
         * If we switched our selected drive to match regOutput, then the ST0 value we returned on an SENSE_INT command
         * following the regOutput reset operation would indicate drive 1 instead of drive 0.  But the BIOS requires
         * the ST0 result from the SENSE_INT command ALWAYS be 0xC0 (not 0xC1), so the controller must not be propagating
         * regOutput's "drive select" bits in the way I originally assumed.

     * It turns out that any 5170 configuration without an HDC component that attempts to use either the REV2 or REV3
     * PC AT ROM BIOS will fail with error "601-Diskette Error", unless we also provide this "D/S/P DIAGNOSTIC REGISTER".
     * The original 5170 REV1 BIOS didn't have this requirement.
     *
     * I'm unable to find any documentation on this so-called "D/S/P DIAGNOSTIC REGISTER" (port 0x3F1) or the "D/S/P CARD"
     * to which the ROM BIOS refers.  But it seems clear that if we don't provide the expected response from the DIAGNOSTIC
     * REGISTER, and there's no HDC to respond to the MULTIPLE DATA RATE CAPABLE test that follows, then an error is
     * inevitable.  Clearly, there is a very intimate relationship between the FDC and HDC portions of this card.
