    /**
     * Maps SOFTCODE (string) to SIMCODE (number) -- which may be the same as KEYCODE for ASCII keys.
     *
     * We define identifiers for all possible keys, based on their primary (unshifted) character or function.
     * This also serves as a definition of all supported keys, making it possible to create full-featured
     * "soft keyboards".
     *
     * One exception to the (unshifted) rule above is 'prtsc': on the original IBM 83-key and 84-key keyboards,
     * its primary (unshifted) character was '*', but on 101-key keyboards, it became a separate key ('prtsc',
     * now labeled "Print Screen"), as did the num-pad '*' ('num-mul'), so 'prtsc' seems worthy of an exception
     * to the rule.
     *
     * On 83-key and 84-key keyboards, 'ctrl'+'num-lock' triggered a "pause" operation and 'ctrl'+'scroll-lock'
     * triggered a "break" operation.
     *
     * On 101-key keyboards, IBM decided to move both those special operations to a new 'pause' ("Pause/Break")
     * key, near the new dedicated 'prtsc' ("Print Screen/SysRq") key -- and to drop the "e" from "Sys Req".
     * Those keys behave as follows:
     *
     *      When 'pause' is pressed alone, it generates 0xe1 0x1d 0x45 0xe1 0x9d 0xc5 on make (nothing on break),
     *      which essentially simulates the make-and-break of the 'ctrl' and 'num-lock' keys (ignoring the 0xe1),
     *      triggering a "pause" operation.
     *
     *      When 'pause' is pressed with 'ctrl', it generates 0xe0 0x46 0xe0 0xc6 on make (nothing on break) and
     *      does not repeat, which essentially simulates the make-and-break of 'scroll-lock', which, in conjunction
     *      with the separate make-and-break of 'ctrl', triggers a "break" operation.
     *
     *      When 'prtsc' is pressed alone, it generates 0xe0 0x2a 0xe0 0x37, simulating the make of both 'shift'
     *      and 'prtsc'; when pressed with 'shift' or 'ctrl', it generates only 0xe0 0x37; and when pressed with
     *      'alt', it generates only 0x54 (to simulate 'sys-req').
     *
     * TODO: Implement the above behaviors, whenever we get around to actually supporting 101-key keyboards.
     *
     * All key identifiers must be quotable using single-quotes, because that's how components.xsl will encode them
     * *inside* the "data-value" attribute of the corresponding HTML control.  Which, in turn, is why the single-quote
     * key is defined as 'quote' rather than "'".  Similarly, if there was unshifted "double-quote" key, it could
     * not be called '"', because components.xsl quotes the *entire* "data-value" attribute using double-quotes.
     *
     * The (commented) numbering of keys below is purely for my own reference.  Two keys are deliberately numbered 84,
     * reflecting the fact that the 'sys-req' key was added to the 84-key keyboard but later dropped from the 101-key
     * keyboard (as a stand-alone key, that is).
     *
     * With the introduction of the PC AT and the 84-key keyboard, IBM developed a new key numbering scheme and
     * key code generation; the 8042 keyboard controller would then convert those key codes into the PC scan codes
     * defined by the older 83-key keyboard.  That's a layer of complexity we currently bypass; instead, we continue
     * to convert browser key codes directly into PC scan codes, which is what our 8042 controller implementation
     * assumes we're doing.

     * that the shift/modifier state for a character on the "source" keyboard may not match the shift/modifier
     * state for the same character on the "target" keyboard.  And since this code is inherited from C1Pjs,

         * New unified approach to key event processing: When we process a key on the "down" event,
         * we check the aKeysActive array: if the key is already active, do nothing; otherwise, insert
         * it into the table, generate the "make" scan code(s), and set a timeout for "repeat" if it's
         * a repeatable key (most are).
         *
         * Similarly, when a key goes "up", if it's already not active, do nothing; otherwise, generate
         * the "break" scan code(s), cancel any pending timeout, and remove it from the active key table.
         *
         * If a "press" event is received, then if the key is already active, remove it and (re)insert
         * it at the head of the table, generate the "make" scan code(s), set nRepeat to -1, and set a
         * timeout for "break".
         *
         * This requires an aKeysActive array that keeps track of the status of every active key; only the
         * first entry in the array is allowed to repeat.  Each entry is a key object with the following
         * properties:
         *
         *      simCode:    our simulated keyCode from onKeyActive or onKeyPress
         *      bitsState:  snapshot of the current bitsState when the key is added (currently not used)
         *      fDown:      next state to simulate (true for down, false for up)
         *      nRepeat:    > 0 if timer should generate more "make" scan code(s), -1 for "break" scan code(s)
         *      timer:      timer for next key operation, if any
         *
         * Keys are inserted at the head of aKeysActive, using splice(0, 0, key), but not before zeroing
         * nRepeat of any repeating key that already occupies the head (index 0), so that at most only one
         * key (ie, the most recent) will ever be in a repeating state.
         *
         * IBM PC keyboard repeat behavior: when pressing CTRL, then C, and then releasing CTRL while still
         * holding C, the repeated CTRL_C characters turn into 'c' characters.  We emulate that behavior.
         * However, when pressing C, then CTRL, all repeating stops: not a single CTRL_C is generated, and
         * even if the CTRL is released before the C, no more more 'c' characters are generated either.
         * We do NOT fully emulate that behavior -- we DO stop the repeating, but we also generate one CTRL_C.
         * More investigation is required, because I need to confirm whether the IBM keyboard automatically
         * "breaks" all non-shift keys before it "makes" the CTRL.

     *
     * Not all SOFTCODES are allowed; for example, SOFTCODES that begin with a digit or other non-alpha symbol,
     * or that contain only one letter, because those SOFTCODES can already be specified as-is, WITHOUT a leading
     * "$".  Also, all we replace here are the "macro" sequences, leaving any prefixed SOFTCODES in place so that
     * injectKeys() can convert them on the fly.
     *
     * If you want any of those sequences to be typed as-is, then you must specify two "$" (eg, "$$date").
     * Pairs of dollar signs will be automatically converted to single dollar signs, and single dollar signs
     * will be used as-is, provided they don't precede any of the above "macro" or SOFTCODE sequences.
     *
     * WARNING: the JavaScript replace() function ALWAYS interprets "$" specially in replacement strings,
     * even when the search string is NOT a RegExp; specifically:
     *
     *      $$  Inserts a "$"
     *      $&  Inserts the matched substring
     *      $`  Inserts the portion of the string that precedes the matched substring
     *      $'  Inserts the portion of the string that follows the matched substring
     *      $n  Where n is a positive integer less than 100, inserts the nth parenthesized sub-match string,
     *          provided the first argument was a RegExp object
     *
     * Since we build machine definitions on a page from a potentially indeterminate number of string replace()
     * operations, multiple dollar signs could eventually get reduced to a single dollar sign BEFORE we get here.
     *
     * To compensate, I've changed a few replace() methods, like MarkOut's convertMDMachineLinks() and HTMLOut's
     * addFilesToHTML(), from the conventional string replace() to my own StrLib.replace(), and for situations like the
     * embed.js parseXML() function, which needs to use a RegExp-style replace(), I've added a preliminary
     * replace(/\$/g, "$$$$") to the replacement string.
     *
