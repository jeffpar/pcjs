/**
 * MDA/CGA Support
 * ---------------
 *
 * Since there's a lot of similarity between the MDA and CGA (eg, their text-mode video buffer
 * format, and their use of the 6845 CRT controller), since the MDA ROM contains the fonts used
 * by both devices, and since the same ROM BIOS supports both (in fact, the BIOS indiscriminately
 * initializes both, regardless which is actually installed), this same component emulates both
 * devices.
 *
 * When no model is specified, this component supports the ability to dynamically switch between
 * MDA and CGA emulation, by simply toggling the SW1 motherboard "monitor type" switch settings
 * and resetting the machine.  In that model-less configuration, we install I/O port handlers for
 * both MDA and CGA cards, regardless which monitor type is initially selected.
 *
 * To simulate an IBM PC containing both an MDA and CGA (ie, a "dual display" system), the machine
 * configuration simply defines two video components, one with model "mda" and the other with model
 * "cga", resulting in two displays; setting a specific model forces each instance of this component
 * to register only those I/O ports belonging to that model.
 *
 * In a single-display system, dynamically switching cards (ie, between MDA and CGA) creates some
 * visual challenges.  For one, the MDA prefers a native screen size of 720x350, as it supports only
 * one video mode, 80x25, with a 9x14 cell size.  The CGA, on the other hand, has an 8x8 cell size,
 * so when using an MDA-size screen, an 80x25 CGA screen will end up with 40-pixel borders on the
 * left and right, and 75-pixel borders on the top and bottom.  The result is a rather tiny CGA font
 * surrounded by lots of wasted space, so it's best to turn on font scaling (see the "scale" property)
 * and go with a larger screen size of, say, 960x400 (50% larger in width, 100% larger in height).
 *
 * I've also added support for font-doubling in createFont().  We use the 8x8 font for 80-column
 * modes and the "doubled" 16x16 font for 40-column modes OR whenever the screen is large enough
 * to use the 16x16 font, since font rendering without scaling provides the sharpest results.
 * In fact, there's special logic in setDimensions() to ignore fScaleFont in certain cases (eg,
 * 40-column modes, to improve sharpness and avoid stretching the font beyond readability).
 *
 * Graphics modes, on the other hand, are always scaled to the screen size.  Pixels are captured
 * in an off-screen buffer, which is then drawn to match the size of the virtual screen.
 *
 * TODO: Whenever there are borders, they should be filled with the CGA's overscan colors.  However,
 * in the case of graphics modes (and text modes whenever font scaling is enabled), we don't reserve
 * any space for borders, so if borders are important, explicit border support will be required.
 *
 * EGA Support
 * -----------
 *
 * EGA support piggy-backs on the existing MDA/CGA support.  All the existing MDA/CGA port handlers
 * now refer to either cardMono or cardColor (instead of directly to cardMDA or cardCGA), enabling
 * the handlers to be redirected to cardMDA, cardCGA or cardEGA as appropriate.
 *
 * Note that an MDA card supported only a Monochrome Display and a CGA card supported only a Color
 * Display (well, OK, *or* a TV monitor, which we don't currently support), but the EGA is much
 * more flexible: the Enhanced Color Display was the preferred display, but the EGA also supported
 * older displays; a Color Display on EGA wasn't ideal (same low resolutions but with more colors),
 * but the EGA also brought high-resolution graphics to Monochrome displays, which was nice.  Anyway,
 * while all those EGA/monitor combinations will be nice to support, our virtual display support
 * will focus initially on the Enhanced Color Display.
 *
 * TODO: Add support for jumpers P1 and P3 (see EGA TechRef p.85).  P1 selects either 5-color-output
 * for a CGA monitor or 6-color-output for an EGA monitor; we would presumably use this only to
 * control certain assumptions about the virtual display's capabilities (ie, Color Display vs. Enhanced
 * Color Display).  P3 can switch all the I/O ports from 0x3nn to 0x2nn; the default is 0x3nn, and
 * that's the only port range the EGA ROM supports as well.
 *
 * For quick reference, IBM EGA register values for the standard EGA modes, from pages 63-68 of the
 * "IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter" (http://minuszerodegrees.net/oa/OA - IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter.pdf).
 *
 * WARNING: Some of these value are not programmed exactly as-is; for example, the CURSCANB values are
 * adjusted +1 by the ROM BIOS in most cases, due to an EGA idiosyncrasy that IBM may not have intended.

 * VGA Support
 * -----------
 *
 * VGA support further piggy-backs on the existing EGA support, by adding the extra registers, I/O port
 * handlers, etc, that the VGA requires; any differences in registers common to both EGA and VGA are handled on
 * a case-by-case basis, usually according to the Videox86.CARD value stored in nCard.
 *
 * More will be said here about PCjs VGA support later.  But first, a word from IBM: "Video Graphics Array [VGA]
 * Programming Considerations":
 *
 *      Certain internal timings must be guaranteed by the user, in order to have the CRTC perform properly.
 *      This is due to the physical design of the chip. These timings can be guaranteed by ensuring that the
 *      rules listed below are followed when programming the CRTC.
 *
 *           1. The Horizontal Total [HTOTAL] register (R0) must be greater than or equal to a value of
 *              25 decimal.
 *
 *           2. The minimum positive pulse width of the HSYNC output must be four character clock units.
 *
 *           3. Register R5, Horizontal Sync End [HREND], must be programmed such that the HSYNC
 *              output goes to a logic 0 a minimum of one character clock time before the 'horizontal display enable'
 *              signal goes to a logical 1.
 *
 *           4. Register R16, Vsync Start [VRSTART], must be a minimum of one horizontal scan line greater
 *              than register R18 [VDEND].  Register R18 defines where the 'vertical display enable' signal ends.
 *
 *     When bit 5 of the Attribute Mode Control register equals 1, a successful line compare (see Line Compare
 *     [LINECOMP] register) in the CRT Controller forces the output of the PEL Panning register to 0's until Vsync
 *     occurs.  When Vsync occurs, the output returns to the programmed value.  This allows the portion of the screen
 *     indicated by the Line Compare register to be operated on by the PEL Panning register.
 *
 *     A write to the Character Map Select register becomes valid on the next whole character line.  No deformed
 *     characters are displayed by changing character generators in the middle of a character scan line.
 *
 *     For 256-color 320 x 200 graphics mode hex 13, the attribute controller is configured so that the 8-bit attribute
 *     stored in video memory for each PEL becomes the 8-bit address (P0 - P7) into the integrated DAC.  The user should
 *     not modify the contents of the internal Palette registers when using this mode.
 *
 *     The following sequence should be followed when accessing any of the Attribute Data registers pointed to by the
 *     Attribute Index register:
 *
 *           1. Disable interrupts

 *
 *      The Color Select register in the Attribute Controller section may be used to rapidly switch between sets of colors
 *      in the video DAC.  When bit 7 of the Attribute Mode Control register equals 0, the 8-bit color value presented to the
 *      video DAC is composed of 6 bits from the internal Palette registers and bits 2 and 3 from the Color Select register.
 *      When bit 7 of the Attribute Mode Control register equals 1, the 8-bit color value presented to the video DAC is
 *      composed of the lower four bits from the internal Palette registers and the four bits in the Color Select register.
 *      By changing the value in the Color Select register, software rapidly switches between sets of colors in the video DAC.
 *      Note that BIOS does not support multiple sets of colors in the video DAC.  The user must load these colors if this
 *      function is to be used.  Also see the Attribute Controller block diagram on page 4-26.  Note that the above discussion
 *      applies to all modes except 256 Color Graphics mode.  In this mode the Color Select register is not used to switch
 *      between sets of colors.
 *
 *      An application that saves the "Video State" must store the 4 bytes of information contained in the system microprocessor
 *      latches in the graphics controller subsection. These latches are loaded with 32 bits from video memory (8 bits per map)
 *      each time the system microprocessor does a read from video memory.  The application needs to:
 *
 *           1. Use write mode 1 to write the values in the latches to a location in video memory that is not part of
 *              the display buffer.  The last location in the address range is a good choice.
 *
 *           2. Save the values of the latches by reading them back from video memory.
 *
 *           Note: If in a chain 4 or odd/even mode, it will be necessary to reconfigure the memory organization as four
 *           sequential maps prior to performing the sequence above.  BIOS provides support for completely saving and
 *           restoring video state.  See the IBM Personal System/2 and Personal Computer BIOS Interface Technical Reference
 *           for more information.
 *
 *      The description of the Horizontal PEL Panning register includes a figure showing the number of PELs shifted left
 *      for each valid value of the PEL Panning register and each valid video mode.  Further panning beyond that shown in
 *      the figure may be accomplished by changing the start address in the CRT Controller registers, Start Address High
 *      and Start Address Low.  The sequence involved in further panning would be as follows:
 *
 *           1. Use the PEL Panning register to shift the maximum number of bits to the left. See Figure 4-103 on page
 *              4-106 for the appropriate values.
 *
 *           2. Increment the start address.
 *
 *           3. If you are not using Modes 0 + , 1 + , 2 + , 3 + ,7, or7 + , set the PEL Panning register to 0.  If you
 *              are using these modes, set the PEL Panning register to 8.  The screen will now be shifted one PEL left
 *              of the position it was in at the end of step 1.  Step 1 through Step 3 may be repeated as desired.
 *
 *      The Line Compare register (CRTC register hex 18) should be programmed with even values in 200 line modes when
 *      used in split screen applications that scroll a second screen on top of a first screen.  This is a requirement
 *      imposed by the scan doubling logic in the CRTC.
 *
 *      If the Cursor Start register (CRTC register hex 0A) is programmed with a value greater than that in the Cursor End
 *      register (CRTC register hex 0B), then no cursor is displayed.  A split cursor is not possible on the VGA.
 *
 *      In 8-dot character modes, the underline attribute produces a solid line across adjacent characters, as in the IBM
 *      Color/Graphics Monitor Adapter, Monochrome Display Adapter and the Enhanced Graphics Adapter.  In 9-dot modes, the
 *      underline across adjacent characters is dashed, as in the IBM 327X display terminals.  In 9-dot modes, the line
 *      graphics characters (C0 - DF character codes) have solid underlines.
 *
 *      For compatibility with the IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), the internal VGA palette is programmed the same
 *      as the EGA.  The video DAC is programmed by BIOS so that the compatible values in the internal VGA palette produce
 *      a color compatible with what was produced by EGA.  Mode hex 13 (256 colors) is programmed so that the first 16
 *      locations in the DAC produce compatible colors.
 *
 *      Summing: When BIOS is used to load the video DAC palette for a color mode and a monochrome display is connected
 *      to the system unit, the color palette is changed.  The colors are summed to produce shades of gray that allow
 *      color applications to produce a readable screen.
 *
 *      There are 4 bits that should not be modified unless the sequencer is reset by setting bit 1 of the Reset register
 *      to 0.  These bits are:
 *
 *           â¢ Bit 3, or bit 0 of the Clocking Mode register
 *           â¢ Bit 3, or bit 2 of the Miscellaneous Output register

/**
 * Supported Monitors
 *
 * The MDA monitor displays 350 lines of vertical resolution, 720 lines of horizontal resolution, and refreshes
 * at ~50Hz.  The CGA monitor displays 200 lines vertically, 640 horizontally, and refreshes at ~60Hz.
 *
 * Based on actual MDA timings (see http://diylab.atwebpages.com/pressureDev.htm), the total horizontal
 * period (drawing a line and retracing) is ~54.25uSec (1000000uSec / 18432) and the horizontal retrace interval
 * is about 15% of that, or ~8.14uSec.  Vertical sync occurs once every 370 horizontal periods.  Of those 370,
 * only 354 represent actively drawn lines (and of those, only 350 are visible); the remaining 16 horizontal
 * periods, or 4% of the 370 total, represent the vertical retrace interval.
 *
 * I don't have similar numbers for the CGA or EGA, so for now, I assume similar percentages; ie, 15% of
 * the horizontal period will represent horizontal retrace, and 4% of the vertical pixel maximum (262) will
 * represent vertical retrace.  However, 24% of the CGA's 262 vertical maximum represents non-visible lines,
 * whereas only 5% of the MDA's 370 maximum represents non-visible lines; is there really that much "overscan"
 * on the CGA?
 *
 * For each monitor type, there's a MonitorSpecs object that describes the horizontal and vertical
 * timings, along with my assumptions about the percentage of time that drawing is "active" within those periods,
 * and then based on the selected monitor type, I compute the number of CPU cycles that each period lasts,
 * as well as the number of CPU cycles that drawing lasts within each period, so that the horizontal and vertical
 * retrace status flags can be quickly calculated.
 *
 * For reference, here are some important numbers to know (from https://github.com/reenigne/reenigne/blob/master/8088/cga/register_values.txt):

    /**
     * EGA Memory Access Functions
     *
     * Here's where we define all the getMemoryAccess() functions that know how to deal with "planar" EGA memory,
     * which consists of 32-bit values for every byte of address space, allowing us to internally store plane 0
     * bytes in bits 0-7, plane 1 bytes in bits 8-15, plane 2 bytes in bits 16-23, and plane 3 bytes in bits 24-31.
     *
     * All our functions have slightly more overhead than the standard Bus memory access functions, because the
     * offset (off) parameter is block-relative, which we must transform into a buffer-relative offset.  Fortunately,
     * all our Memory objects know this and have already recorded their buffer-relative offset in "this.offset".
     *
     * Also, the EGA includes a set of latches, one for each plane, which must be updated on most reads/writes;
     * we rely on the Memory object's "this.controller" property to give us access to the Card's state.
     *
     * And we take a little extra time to conditionally set DIRTY on writes, meaning if a write did not actually
     * change the value of the memory, we will not set DIRTY.  The default write functions in memory.js don't take
     * that performance hit, but here, it may be worthwhile, because if it results in fewer dirty blocks, display
     * updates may be faster.
     *
     * Note that we don't have to worry about dealing with word accesses that straddle block boundaries, because
     * the Bus component automatically breaks those accesses into separate byte requests.  Similarly, byte and word
     * values for the write functions have already been pre-masked by the Bus component to 8 and 16 bits, respectively.
     *
     * My motto: Be paranoid, but also be careful not to do any more work than you absolutely have to.
     *
     *
     * CGA Emulation on the EGA
     *
     * Modes 4/5 (320x200 low-res graphics) emulate the same buffer format that the CGA uses.  To recap: 1 byte contains
     * 4 pixels (pixel 0 in bits 7-6, pixel 1 in bits 5-4, etc), and thus one row of pixels is 80 (0x50) bytes long.
     * Moreover, all even rows are stored in the first 8K of the video buffer (at 0xB8000), and all odd rows are stored
     * in the second 8K (at 0xBA000).  Of each 8K, only 8000 (0x1F40) bytes are used (80 bytes X 100 rows); the remaining
     * 192 bytes of each 8K are unused.
     *
     * For these modes, the EGA's GRC.MODE is programmed with 0x30: Card.GRC.MODE.EVENODD and Card.GRC.MODE.SHIFT.
     * The latter claims to work by forming each 2-bit pixel with even bits from plane 0 and odd bits from plane 1;
     * however, I'm unclear how that works if even bytes are only written to plane 0 and odd bytes are only written to
     * plane 1, as Card.GRC.MODE.EVENODD implies, because plane 0 would never have any bits for the odd bytes, and
     * plane 1 would never have any bits for the even bytes.  TODO: Figure this out.
     *
     *
     * Even/Odd Memory Access Functions
     *
     * The "EVENODD" functions deal with the EGA's default text-mode addressing, where EVEN addresses are mapped to
     * plane 0 (and 2) and ODD addresses are mapped to plane 1 (and 3).  This occurs when SEQ.MEMMODE.SEQUENTIAL is
     * clear (and GRC.MODE.EVENODD is set), turning address bit 0 (A0) into a "plane select" bit.  Whether A0 is also
     * used as a memory address bit depends on CRTC.MODECTRL.BYTE_MODE: if it's set, then we're in "Byte Mode" and A0 is
     * used as-is; if it's clear, then we're in "Word Mode", and either A15 (when CRTC.MODECTRL.ADDR_WRAP is set) or A13
     * (when CRTC.MODECTRL.ADDR_WRAP is clear, typically when only 64Kb of EGA memory is installed) is substituted for A0.
     *
     * Note that A13 remains clear until addresses reach 8K, at which point we've spanned 32Kb of EGA memory, so it makes
     * sense to propagate A13 to A0 at that point, so that the next 8K of addresses start using ODD instead of EVEN bytes,
     * and no memory is wasted on a 64Kb EGA card.
     *
     * These functions, however, don't yet deal with all those subtleties: A0 is currently used only as a "plane select"
     * bit and set to zero for addressing purposes, meaning that only the EVEN bytes in EGA memory will ever be used.
     * TODO: Implement the subtleties.

     * undefined come back via the JSON round-trip as *initialized* arrays whose elements are now all null.

     *
     * The simple solution is to change such comparisons to 'aReg[i] == null', because undefined is coerced
     * to null, whereas numeric values are not.
     *

     * Rather than requiring the first parameter to ALWAYS be a frame buffer address OR a frame buffer
     * offset, we'll just make a guess as to what the user intended and support BOTH; basically, if the
     * value is less than the frame buffer address, we'll assume it's an offset.
     *
     * Also, we allow some special options to be encoded in asArgs: 'l' followed by a number means
     * print that many rows of data.  'n' followed by a number (1-8) means print only that number of
     * memory locations per row, and then adjust the starting address of the next row by the number
     * of bytes per row (or whatever is specified by the 'w' option) so that the dump reflects a
     * rectangular chunk of video data.  Finally, if asArgs contains 'p' followed by a number (0-3),
     * we display only the bits from that plane for each memory location, in binary instead of hex.
     *
     * For example, assuming a standard VGA frame buffer with 640x480 pixels across 38400 (0x9600) memory
     * locations, the following command will dump a vertical swath of bits from plane 0 that is 32 (0x20)
     * rows tall and 8 columns wide, from roughly the center of the screen (0x4B00 + 0x28 - 2 = 0x4B26).
     *
     *      d video 4b26 l20 n8 p0
     *
     * Subsequent commands that omit a starting address or offset will continue where the last dump
     * left off; eg:
     *
     *      d video n8 p0
     *
     * To dump a chunk of off-screen memory starting at 0x9600, where the Windows VGA driver typically
     * stores a copy of the video memory containing the current mouse pointer:
     *
     *      d video 9600 l20 n5 w5 p0
     *
     * Alternatively, you could use decimal values:
     *
     *      d video 9600 l32. n5. w5. p0.
     *
     * NOTE: If these commands look suspiciously like weird Hayes modem command strings, trust me,
     * that is ENTIRELY coincidental (but mildly amusing).
     *
     * TODO: Make these options more general-purpose (it currently assumes a conventional VGA planar layout).

     *      In alphanumeric modes, characters are formed from one of two ROM (Read Only Memory) character

     *      For Enhanced Color Display support, the 9x14 character set is modified to provide an 8x14 character set.
     *      The second character generator defines 7x7 characters in an 8x8 character box. These generators contain

     * MDA attribute byte definitions
     *
     * For MDA, only the first eight ATTR definitions are supported; any FGND/BGND value combinations outside that
     * group will be treated as "normal" (ATTR_FGND_WHITE | ATTR_BGND_BLACK).
     *
     * NOTE: Assuming MDA.MODE.BLINK_ENABLE is set (which the ROM BIOS sets by default), ATTR_BGND_BLINK will
     * cause the *foreground* element of the cell to blink, even though it is part of the *background* attribute bits.
     *
     * Regarding blink rate, characters are supposed to blink every 16 vertical frames, which amounts to .26667 blinks
     * per second, assuming a 60Hz vertical refresh rate.  So roughly every 267ms, we need to take care of any blinking
     * characters.  updateScreen() maintains a global count (cBlinkVisible) of blinking characters, to simplify the
     * decision of when to redraw the screen.
     *
     * Here's a "cheat sheet" for attribute byte combinations that the IBM MDA could have supported.  The original (Aug 1981)
     * IBM Tech Ref is very terse and implies that only those marked with * are actually supported.
     *
     *     *0x00: non-display                       ATTR_FGND_BLACK |                    ATTR_BGND_BLACK
     *     *0x01: underline                         ATTR_FGND_ULINE |                    ATTR_BGND_BLACK
     *     *0x07: normal (white on black)           ATTR_FGND_WHITE |                    ATTR_BGND_BLACK
     *    **0x09: bright underline                  ATTR_FGND_ULINE | ATTR_FGND_BRIGHT | ATTR_BGND_BLACK
     *    **0x0F: bold (bright white on black)      ATTR_FGND_WHITE | ATTR_FGND_BRIGHT | ATTR_BGND_BLACK
     *     *0x70: reverse (black on white)          ATTR_FGND_BLACK |                  | ATTR_BGND_WHITE
     *      0x81: blinking underline                ATTR_FGND_ULINE |                  | ATTR_BGND_BLINK (or dim background if blink disabled)
     *    **0x87: blinking normal                   ATTR_FGND_WHITE |                  | ATTR_BGND_BLINK (or dim background if blink disabled)
     *      0x89: blinking bright underline         ATTR_FGND_ULINE | ATTR_FGND_BRIGHT | ATTR_BGND_BLINK (or dim background if blink disabled)
     *    **0x8F: blinking bold                     ATTR_FGND_WHITE | ATTR_FGND_BRIGHT | ATTR_BGND_BLINK (or dim background if blink disabled)
     *    **0xF0: blinking reverse                  ATTR_FGND_WHITE | ATTR_FGND_BRIGHT | ATTR_BGND_BLINK (or bright background if blink disabled)
     *
     * Unsupported attributes reportedly display as "normal" (ATTR_FGND_WHITE | ATTR_BGND_BLACK).  However, precisely which
     * attributes are unsupported on the MDA varies depending on the source.  Some sources (eg, the IBM Tech Ref) imply that
     * only those marked by * are supported, while others (eg, some--but not all--Peter Norton guides) include those marked
     * by **, and still others include ALL the combinations listed above.
     *
     * Furthermore, according to http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/mda.html:
     *
     *      Attributes 0x00, 0x08, 0x80 and 0x88 display as black space;
     *      Attribute 0x78 displays as dark green on green; depending on the monitor, there may be a green "halo" where the dark and bright bits meet;
     *      Attribute 0xF0 displays as a blinking version of 0x70 if blink enabled, and black on bright green otherwise;
     *      Attribute 0xF8 displays as a blinking version of 0x78 if blink enabled, and as dark green on bright green otherwise.
     *
     * However, I'm rather skeptical about supporting 0x78 and 0xF8, until I see some evidence that "bright black" actually
     * produced dark green on IBM equipment; it also doesn't sound like a combination many people would have used.  I'll probably
     * treat all of 0x08, 0x80 and 0x88 the same as 0x00, only because it seems logical (they're all "black on black" combinations
     * with only BRIGHT and/or BLINK bits set). Beyond that, I'll likely treat any other combination not listed in the above cheat
     * sheet as "normal".
     *
     * All the discrepancies/disagreements I've found are probably due in part to the proliferation of IBM and non-IBM MDA
     * cards, combined with IBM and non-IBM monochrome monitors, and people assuming that their non-IBM card and/or monitor
     * behaved exactly like the original IBM equipment, which probably wasn't true in all cases.
     *
     * I would like to limit my MDA display support to EXACTLY everything that the IBM MDA supported and nothing more, but
     * since there will be combinations that will logically "fall out" unless I specifically exclude them, it's very likely
     * this implementation will end up being a superset.
     *
     * CGA attribute byte definitions simply extend the set of MDA attributes, with the exception of ATTR_FNGD_ULINE,
     * which the CGA can treat only as ATTR_FGND_BLUE.

     *
     *      model: model (eg, "mda" for Monochrome Display Adapter)
     *      mode: initial video mode (default is null, which selects a mode based on model)
     *      screenWidth: width of the screen canvas, in pixels
     *      screenHeight: height of the screen canvas, in pixels
     *      screenColor: background color of the screen canvas (default is black)
     *      flicker: 1 enables screen flicker, 0 disables (default is 0.5)
     *      scale: true for font scaling, false (default) to center the display on the screen
     *      charCols: number of character columns
     *      charRows: number of character rows
     *      fontROM: path to .rom file (or a JSON representation) containing the character set
     *      touchScreen: string specifying desired touch-screen support (default is none)
     *      autoLock: true to (attempt to) auto-lock the mouse to the canvas (default is false)
     *      randomize: 1 enables screen randomization, 0 disables (default is 1)
     *      irq: 0-15 for IRQ, -1 to disable (default is null, implying Chipset.IRQ.VID or 2)
     *
     * An EGA/VGA may specify the following additional properties:
     *
     *      switches: string representing EGA switches (see "SW1-SW4" documentation below)
     *      memory: the size of the EGA's on-board memory (overrides EGA's Videox86.cardSpecs)
     *
     * This calls the Bus to allocate a video buffer at the appropriate memory location whenever
     * a reset() or setMode() occurs; setMode() is called whenever a mode change is detected at
     * the port level, and whenever reset() is called.  setMode() also invokes updateScreen(true),
     * which forces reallocation of our internal buffer (aCellCache) that mirrors the video buffer.
     *
     * Our initBus() handler defines a timer that periodically calls updateScreen() for each Video
     * instance.  These updates should occur at a rate of 60 times/second, to update any blinking
     * elements (the cursor and any cells with the blink attribute), to compare/update the contents
     * of our internal buffer with the video buffer, and to render any differences between the two
     * buffers into the associated screen canvas, via either updateChar() or setPixel().
     *
     * Thanks to the Bus' new block-based memory manager that allows us to sparse-allocate memory
     * (in 4Kb increments), updateScreen() can also ask the CPU for the "dirty" state of all the
     * blocks underlying the video buffer, bypassing the update completely if the buffer is still clean.
     *
     * Sadly, that optimization is defeated if the count of active blink elements is non-zero,
     * because we must rescan the entire buffer to locate and redraw them all; I'm assuming for now
     * that, more often than not, very few (if any) blink attributes will be present, and therefore
     * they're not worth a separate caching mechanism.  If the only blinking element is the cursor,
     * that's no problem, as we redraw only the one cell containing the cursor (assuming the buffer
     * is otherwise clean).

                 *
                 *      "For characters C0h-DFh, the ninth pixel column is a duplicate of the eighth; for others, it's blank."
                 *
                 * This last point is confirmed by "The IBM Personal Computer From The Inside Out", p.295:
                 *
                 *      "Another unique feature of the monochrome adapter is a set of line-drawing and area-fill characters
                 *      that give continuous lines and filled areas. This is unusual for a display with a 9x14 character box
                 *      because the character generator provides a row only eight dots wide. On most displays, a blank 9th
                 *      dot is then inserted between characters. On the monochrome display, there is circuitry that duplicates
                 *      the 8th dot into the 9th dot position for characters whose ASCII codes are 0xB0 [sic] through 0xDF."
                 *
                 * However, the above text is mistaken about the start of the range.  While there ARE line-drawing characters
                 * in the range 0xB0-0xBF, none of them extend all the way to the right edge; IBM carefully segregated them.
                 * And in fact, characters 0xB0-0xB2 contain hash patterns that you would NOT want extended into the 9th column.
                 *
                 * The CGA font is part of the same ROM.  In fact, there are TWO CGA fonts in the ROM: a thin 5x7 "single dot"
                 * font located at offset 0x1000, and a thick 7x7 "double dot" font at offset 0x1800.  The latter is the default
                 * font, unless overridden by a jumper setting on the CGA card, so it is our default CGA font as well (although
                 * someday we may provide a virtual jumper setting that allows you to select the thinner font).
                 *
                 * The first offset we must pass to setFontData() is the offset of the CGA font; we choose the thicker "double dot"
                 * CGA font at 0x1800 (which was the PC's default font as well), instead of the thinner "single dot" font at 0x1000.

             * HACK: Android-based browsers, like the Silk (Amazon) browser and Chrome for Android, don't honor the
             * "contenteditable" attribute; that is, when the canvas receives focus, they don't activate the on-screen
             * keyboard.  So my fallback is to create a transparent textarea on top of the canvas.
             *
             * The parent DIV must have a style of "position:relative" (alternatively, a class of "pcjs-container"),
             * so that we can position the textarea using absolute coordinates.  Also, we don't want the textarea to be
             * visible, but we must use "opacity:0" instead of "visibility:hidden", because the latter seems to prevent
             * the element from receiving events.  These styling requirements are taken care of in components.css
             * (see references to the "pcjs-video-object" class).
             *
             * UPDATE: Unfortunately, Android keyboards like to compose whole words before transmitting any of the
             * intervening characters; our textarea's keyDown/keyUp event handlers DO receive intervening key events,
             * but their keyCode property is ZERO.  Virtually the only usable key event we receive is the Enter key.
             * Android users will have to use machines that include their own on-screen "soft keyboard", or use an
             * external keyboard.
             *
             * The following attempt to use a password-enabled input field didn't work any better on Android.  You could
             * clearly see the overlaid semi-transparent input field, but none of the input characters were passed along,
             * with the exception of the "Go" (Enter) key.
             *
             *      let input = document.createElement("input");
             *      input.setAttribute("type", "password");

             *      element.appendChild(input);
