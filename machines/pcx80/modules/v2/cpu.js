     *
     *      cycles: the machine's base cycles per second; the CPUStateX80 constructor
     *      will provide us with a default (based on the CPU model) to use as a fallback.
     *
     *      multiplier: base cycle multiplier; default is 1.
     *
     *      autoStart: true to automatically start, false to not, or null if "it depends";
     *      null is the default, which means do not autostart UNLESS there is no Debugger
     *      and no "Run" button (ie, no way to manually start the machine).
     *
     *      csStart: the number of cycles that runCPU() must wait before generating
     *      checksum records; -1 if disabled. checksum records are a diagnostic aid
     *      used to help compare one CPU run to another.
     *
     *      csInterval: the number of cycles that runCPU() must execute before generating
     *      a checksum record; -1 if disabled.
     *
     *      csStop: the number of cycles to stop generating checksum records.
     *
     * This component is primarily responsible for interfacing the CPU with the outside
     * world (eg, Panel and Debugger components), and managing overall CPU operation.
     *
     * It is extended by the CPUStateX80 component, where the simulation control logic resides.
