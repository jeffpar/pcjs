     * ComputerX80(parmsComputer, parmsMachine, fSuspended)
     *
     * The ComputerX80 component has no required (parmsComputer) properties, but it does
     * support the following:
     *
     *      autoPower: true to automatically power the computer (default), false to wait;
     *      false is honored only if a "power" button binding exists.
     *
     *      busWidth: number of memory address lines (address bits) on the computer's "bus";
     *      20 is the minimum (and the default), which implies 8086/8088 real-mode addressing,
     *      while 24 is required for 80286 protected-mode addressing.  This value is passed
     *      directly through to the Bus component; see that component for more details.
     *
     *      resume: one of the ComputerX80.RESUME constants, which are as follows:
     *          '0' if resume disabled (default)
     *          '1' if enabled without prompting
     *          '2' if enabled with prompting
     *          '3' if enabled with prompting and auto-delete
     *          or a string containing the path of a predefined JSON-encoded state
     *
     *      state: the path to JSON-encoded state file (see details regarding 'state' below)
     *
     * The parmsMachine object, if provided, may contain any of:
     *
     *      autoMount: if set, this should override any 'autoMount' property in the FDC's
     *      parmsFDC object.
     *
     *      autoPower: if set, this should override any 'autoPower' property in the ComputerX80's
     *      parmsComputer object.
     *
     *      messages: if set, this should override any 'messages' property in the Debugger's
     *      parmsDbg object.
     *
     *      state: if set, this should override any 'state' property in the ComputerX80's
     *      parmsComputer object.
     *
     *      url: the location of the machine XML file
     *
     * If a predefined state is supplied AND it's successfully loaded, then resume behavior
     * defaults to '1' (ie, resume enabled without prompting).
     *
     * This component insures that all components are ready before "powering" them.
     *
     * Different components become ready at different times, and initialization order (ie,
     * the order the scripts are combined on the page) only partially determines readiness.
     * This is because components like ROM and Video must finish loading their resource files
     * before they are ready.  Other components become ready after we call their initBus()
     * function, because they have a Bus or CPU dependency, such as access to memory management
     * functions.  And other components, like CPU and Panel, are ready as soon as their
     * constructor finishes.
     *
     * Once a component has indicated it's ready, we call its powerUp() notification
     * function (if it has one--it's optional).  We call the CPU's powerUp() function last,
     * so that the CPU is assured that all other components are ready and "powered".

     * There's one scenario that powerOff() isn't currently able to deal with very effectively: what to do when
     * the user switches away while it's still being restored, causing Disk getResource() calls to fail.  The
     * Disk component calls notify() when that happens -- see Disk.mount() -- but the FDC and HDC controllers don't
     * notify *us* of those problems, so Computer assumes that the restore was completely successful, when in fact
     * it was only partially successful.
     *
     * Then we immediately arrive here to perform a save, following that incomplete restore.  It would be wrong to
     * deal with that incomplete restore by setting fRestoreError, because we don't want to trigger a powerReport()
     * and the deletion of the previous state, because the state itself was presumably OK.  Unfortunately, the new
     * state we now save will no longer include manually mounted disk images whose remounts were interrupted, so future
     * restores won't remount them either.
     *
     * We could perhaps solve this by having the Disk component notify us in those situations, set a new flag
     * (fRestoreIncomplete?), and set fSave to false if that's ever set.  Be careful though: when fSave is false,
     * that means MORE than not saving; it also means deleting any previous state, which is NOT what you'd want to
     * do in a "fRestoreIncomplete" situation.  Also, we have to worry about Disk operations that fail for other reasons,
     * making sure those failures don't interfere with the save process in the same way.

     * It's worth noting that "onbeforeunload" offers one nice feature when used instead of "onload": the entire
     * page (and therefore this entire application) is retained in its current state by the browser (well, some
     * browsers), so that if you go to a new URL, either by entering a new URL in the same window/tab, or by pressing
     * the FORWARD button, and then you press the BACK button, the page is immediately restored to its previous state.
     *
     * In fact, that's how some browsers operate whether you have an "onbeforeunload" handler or not; in other words,
     * an "onbeforeunload" handler doesn't change the page retention behavior of the browser.  By contrast, the mere
     * presence of an "onunload" handler generally causes a browser to throw the page away once the handler returns.
     *
     * However, in order to safely use "onbeforeunload", we must add yet another handler ("onpageshow") to repower
     * everything, without either resetting or restoring.  Hence, the ComputerX80.show() function, which calls powerOn()

     * powered again (so that, for example, the Video component will start drawing again) and firing the CPU up again.
     *
     * Reportedly, some browsers (eg, Opera) don't support "onbeforeunload", in which case Component will have to use
     * "unload" instead.  But even when the page must be rebuilt from scratch, the combination of browser cache and
