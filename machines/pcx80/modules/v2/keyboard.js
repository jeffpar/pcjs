                     * get shift-key events, so we have no way of distinguishing between certain keys, such as ':' and
                     * ';', unless we are monitoring key presses.  Another reason is that, under certain poorly documented
                     * conditions, an iOS keyup event will not contain any keyCode; this is most easily reproduced with
                     * the iOS simulator and a physical keyboard (not the pop-up keyboard).  When this happens, we think
                     * the key is stuck.  Finally, certain other problems that we have tried to resolve when using a physical
                     * keyboard (eg, keeping the physical and virtual CAPS-LOCK states in sync) simply don't exist in the
                     * iOS environment.
                     *
                     * So, with all that mind, it seems best to have a separate iOS keypress handler and forego keydown
                     * and keyup events entirely.  The iOS keypress handler must also perform some additional checks, such
                     * as watching for keys that can only be typed on the emulated device when a shift key is down, and
                     * simulating "fake" shift-key down and up events.
                     *
                     * Perhaps we can eventually standardize on this alternate keypress-centric approach for ALL devices,
                     * but until then, it's safer to have these two code paths.
                     *
                     * UPDATE: So much for the best laid plans.  iOS won't deliver BACKSPACE events to the keypress handler,
                     * so we have to deal with keydown/keyup events after all.

     * Called whenever the VT100 ChipSet circuit needs the Keyboard UART's transmitter status.
     *
     * From p. 4-32 of the VT100 Technical Manual (July 1982):
     *
     *      The operating clock for the keyboard interface comes from an address line in the video processor (LBA4).
     *      This signal has an average period of 7.945 microseconds. Each data byte is transmitted with one start bit
     *      and one stop bit, and each bit lasts 16 clock periods. The total time for each data byte is 160 times 7.945
     *      or 1.27 milliseconds. Each time the Transmit Buffer Empty flag on the terminal's UART gets set (when the
     *      current byte is being transmitted), the microprocessor loads another byte into the transmit buffer. In this
     *      way, the stream of status bytes to the keyboard is continuous.
     *
     * We used to always return true (after all, what's wrong with an infinitely fast UART?), but unfortunately,
     * the VT100 firmware relies on the UART's slow transmission speed to drive cursor blink rate.  We have several
     * options:
     *
     *      1) Snapshot the CPU cycle count each time a byte is transmitted (see outVT100UARTStatus()) and then every
     *      time this is polled, see if the cycle count has exceeded the snapshot value by the necessary threshold;
     *      if we assume 361.69ns per CPU cycle, there are 22 CPU cycles for every 1 LBA4 cycle, and since transmission
     *      time is supposed to last for 160 LBA4 cycles, the threshold is 22*160 CPU cycles, or 3520 cycles.
     *
     *      2) Set a CPU timer using the new setTimer() interface, which can be passed the number of milliseconds to
     *      wait before firing (in this case, roughly 1.27ms).
     *
     *      3) Call the ChipSet's getVT100LBA(4) function for the state of the simulated LBA4, and count 160 LBA4
     *      transitions; however, that would be the worst solution, because there's no guarantee that the firmware's
     *      UART polling will occur regularly and/or frequently enough for us to catch every LBA4 transition.
     *
     * I'm going with solution #1 because it's less overhead.
