     * C1PKeyboard(parmsKbd)
     *
     * The Keyboard component can be configured with the following (parmsKbd) properties:
     *
     *      model: model number (one of: 542 or 600; 600 is the default)
     *
     * Its main purpose is to receive binding requests for various keyboard events,
     * and to use those events to simulate the C1P's keyboard hardware; specifically,
     * an OSI model 600 board (NOT the model 542).
     *
     * Keys on the C1P keyboard that differ from modern keyboards, along with their
     * closest modern counterpart:
     *
     *      C1P      PC
     *      ---      --
     *      2"       2@
     *      6&       6^
     *      7'       7&
     *      8(       8*
     *      9)       9(
     *      0        0)
     *      :*       -_
     *      -=       =+
     *      ;+       ;:
     *      LINEFEED CTRL-J
     *      RETURN   ENTER (or CTRL-M)
     *      SHIFT-O  DELETE (or CTRL-H)
     *      SHIFT-N  ^
     *      SHIFT-P  @ (used by the BASIC-IN-ROM to abandon the current line)
     *      SHIFT-L  \
     *      SHIFT-K  [
     *      SHIFT-M  ]
     *      CTRL-C   Same (used by the BASIC-IN-ROM to interrupt RUN and LIST, unless disabled with POKE 530,1)
     *      CTRL-O   Same (used by the BASIC-IN-ROM to suppress output until another CTRL-O is typed)
     *      RUB-OUT  (no mapping chosen for this key yet)
     *      REPEAT   (no mapping chosen for this key yet)
     *
     * Problems with iOS Devices
     * -------------------------
     * The keyboard pops up with the SHIFT key depressed, which is not the initial keyboard state that the C1P expects.
     * I tried to fix that by adding an 'autocapitalize="off"' attribute alongside the 'contenteditable="true"' attribute
     * on the <canvas> element, but apparently Safari v5 honors that only inside certain elements (eg, <input>).  The simplest
     * work-around is to tap the iOS device's SHIFT key before starting to type, but I'd prefer an automatic solution.
     *
     * Another work-around might be to NEVER pass the real CAPS-LOCK state to the virtual machine, and whenever CAPS-LOCK is
     * actually down, automatically "uncapitalize" all letters.
     *
     * However, the current work-around is for keyPressSimulate() to ALWAYS convert all alphabetic charCodes to their
     * lower-case equivalents, and simply let the C1P's own shift-key logic do its thing.  Note that we do this ONLY for
     * iOS devices, so that on all other devices, you can still use special shifted key combinations like SHIFT-O and SHIFT-P;
     * this work-around breaks those key combinations for iOS devices, but that seems like a reasonable trade-off.
     *
     * Simple C1P Virtual Hardware Test
     * --------------------------------
     * Using the following code:
     *
     *      10 POKE 530,1
     *      20 KEY=57088
     *      25 Q=-1
     *      30 POKE KEY,64
     *      40 P=PEEK(KEY)
     *      50 IF P<>Q THEN PRINT P
     *      60 Q=P
     *      70 GOTO 30
     *
     * The value 64 (0x40) should have enabled every row except R6.  Here were the results for keys
     * on row R7:
     *
     *        1   2   3   4   5   6   7
     *      --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
     *      126 190 222 238 246 250 252
     *
     * Sure enough, none of the keys on R6 worked, and all the keys on rows R0-R5 generated the same
     * values as R7. But why were the values read all EVEN instead of ODD (ie, why was bit 0 cleared as
     * well?)  Answer: because 0x40 also enables keys on row R0, where the SHIFT-LOCK key resides,
     * and since the SHIFT-LOCK is normally locked AND also sits in column C0, bit 0 will be clear as well.
     *
     * This explains why the "STAR WARS" game (SAMPLE4.BAS) expected values "126,190,222,238,246,250"
     * for keys 1-6 after POKE'ing 64 into location 57088 (0xdf00), instead of the more typical values
     * "127,191,223,239,247,251."  This also means that anyone who happened to unlock their SHIFT-LOCK
     * would have trouble playing that game.

         * the high byte contains the row/col pair (in the high and low nibbles, respectively), and the low byte
         * contains any required shift-key code.
         *
         * For example, an apostrophe (0x27) is an unshifted key on a modern keyboard, but it is a SHIFT-7 on the
         * C1P keyboard, so when I simulate the 7, I must also simulate a SHIFT (I always choose the LEFT shift
         * key -- CHARCODE_LSHIFT -- but that choice is completely arbitrary).
         *
         * Using charCodes (from keyPress events) proved to be more robust than using keyCodes (from keyDown and
         * keyUp events), in part because of differences between the C1P keyboard's layout and modern keyboards,
         * and also because of differences in the way browsers generate the keyDown and keyUp events.  For
         * example, Safari on iOS devices will not generate up/down events for shift keys, and for other keys,
         * the up/down events are usually generated after the actual press is complete, and in rapid succession,
         * which doesn't give the slow C1P virtual machine enough time to detect the key.
         *
         * There are still a few times that I call keyEventSimulate() from keyEvent(), and for those occasions,
         * I create a pseudo-charCode value by adding PSEUDO_CHARCODE (0xE0) to the keyCode value, to avoid any
         * confusion with real charCodes:
         *
         *      CHARCODE_LSHIFT     (originally 0x10, which also looks like CTRL-P, so converted to 0xF0)
         *      CHARCODE_CTRL       (originally 0x11, which also looks like CTRL-Q, so converted to 0xF1)
         *      CHARCODE_RSHIFT     (originally 0x12, which also looks like CTRL-R, so converted to 0xF2)
         *      CHARCODE_SHIFTLOCK  (originally 0x14, which also looks like CTRL-T, so converted to 0xF4)
         *
         * Again, as things currently stand, iOS devices will never generate the above charCodes, so any C1P software
         * that relies detecting on shift-key state changes will not work on those devices.
         *
         * For reference purposes, I've left some parenthetical references to corresponding keyCodes in the comments
         * below.  Relying on keyCodes is problematic, which is why I've tried to eliminate most dependencies on them,
         * but still, they're all you get on keyDown/keyUp events.
