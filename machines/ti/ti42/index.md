The TI MBA "electronic business calculator" was produced in 1977 and marketed by Texas Instruments in the
United States as "The MBA", whereas in Europe it was called the "TI-42 MBA".  Here, we'll simply call it the TI-42.

Building on the PCjs [TI-57 Emulator](../ti57/), the PCjs TI-55 Emulator is now available,
with optional [Diagnostics](diags/).
