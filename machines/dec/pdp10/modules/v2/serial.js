/**
 * Since the Closure Compiler treats ES6 classes as @struct rather than @dict by default,
 * it deters us from defining named properties on our components; eg:
 *
 *      this['exports'] = {...}
 *
 * results in an error:
 *
 *      Cannot do '[]' access on a struct
 *
 * So, in order to define 'exports', we must override the @struct assumption by annotating
 * the class as @unrestricted (or @dict).  Note that this must be done both here and in the
 * Component class, because otherwise the Compiler won't allow us to *reference* the named
 * property either.
 *
 * TODO: Consider marking ALL our classes unrestricted, because otherwise it forces us to
 * define every single property the class uses in its constructor, which results in a fair
 * bit of redundant initialization, since many properties aren't (and don't need to be) fully
 * initialized until the appropriate init(), reset(), restore(), etc. function is called.
 *
 * The upside, however, may be that since the structure of the class is completely defined by
 * the constructor, JavaScript engines may be able to optimize and run more efficiently.
