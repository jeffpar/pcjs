     * The Monitor component manages the container representing the machine's display device.  The most
     * important config properties include:
     *
     *      monitorWidth: width of the monitor canvas, in pixels
     *      monitorHeight: height of the monitor canvas, in pixels
     *      monitorColor: background color of the monitor canvas (default is black)
     *      monitorRotate: the amount of counter-clockwise monitor rotation required (eg, -90 or 270)
     *      aspectRatio (eg, 1.33)
     *
     * NOTE: I originally wanted to call this the Screen device, but alas, the browser world has co-opted that
     * name, so I had to settle for Monitor instead (I had also considered Display, but that seemed too generic).
     *
     * Monitor is probably a better choice anyway, because that allows us to clearly differentiate between the
     * "host display" (which involves the browser's page, document, window, or screen, depending on the context)
     * and the "guest display", which I now try to consistently refer to as the Monitor.
     *
     * There are still terms of art that can muddy the waters; for example, many video devices support the concept
     * of "off-screen memory", and sure, I could call that "off-monitor memory", but let's not get carried away.

         * we generally always need a surface for capturing keyboard events on desktop devices, whereas you're

                 *      Gecko automatically adds CSS rules to the element to stretch it to fill the screen: "width: 100%; height: 100%".
                 *
                 * Which would be OK if Gecko did that BEFORE we're called, but apparently it does that AFTER, effectively
                 * overwriting our careful calculations.  So we style the inner element (canvasMonitor) instead, which
                 * requires even more work to ensure that the canvas is properly centered.  FYI, this solution is consistent
                 * with Mozilla's recommendation for working around their automatic CSS rules:
                 *
                 *      '[I]f you're trying to emulate WebKit's behavior on Gecko, you need to place the element you want
                 *      to present inside another element, which you'll make fullscreen instead, and use CSS rules to adjust
                 *      the inner element to match the appearance you want.'
