 * Common (supported) diskette geometries.
 *
 * Each entry in GEOMETRIES is an array of values in "CHS" order:
 *
 *      [# cylinders, # heads, # sectors/track, # bytes/sector, media ID]
 *
 * If the 4th value is omitted, the sector size is assumed to be 512.  The order of these "geometric" values mirrors
 * the structure of our JSON-encoded disk images, which consist of an array of cylinders, each of which is an array of
 * heads, each of which is an array of sector objects.
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 *      1720320 is used by Microsoft "DMF" diskettes (eg, OEM signature "MSDMF3.2"); see Windows 95.
 *
 *      1884160 is used by IBM "XDF" diskettes (eg, OEM signature "IBM 20.0") which effectively have 23 512-byte
 *      sectors per track, but whose tracks (beyond track 0) are actually formatted with one 8Kb sector, one 2Kb sector,
 *      one 1Kb sector, and one 512-byte sector; see PC DOS 7.0.  Unsure why IBM chose media ID 0xF9.
