I recently added a demo of the [Logitech Modula-2/86 Compiler (1984)](/software/pcx86/lang/logitech/modula2/1.10/),
because I wanted to recreate the IBM PC test environment that John T. Cockerham had used in his October 1986
[PC Tech Journal](/documents/magazines/pctj/) article "[Evaluating the EGA: The EGA Standard](/documents/magazines/pctj/#pctj-1986-10)".

I actually wanted to do that several years ago, when I first added EGA support to PCx86 (the PCjs emulation of the
IBM PC), because Cockerham described two rigorous tests of EGA hardware compatibility that I would have liked to try:

- **FantasyLand**, an EGA demo written by IBM in 1984
- [EGATEST](/software/pcx86/sw/magazines/pctj/#directory-of-pc-tech-journal-1986-10), a program written by Cockerham himself in Modula-2

Cockerham describes **FantasyLand**:

> IBM wrote FantasyLand in 1984 in order to demonstrate some of the more obscure features of the EGA.
The program was distributed very selectively to dealers and sales representatives; it has never been a product
intended for sale.

> FantasyLand builds a large, 150-by-400-character virtual text screen in the EGA video RAM. The screen uses custom
fonts to create a map of an imaginary continent, complete with rivers, lakes, mountains, and fantastic creatures
like dragons and sea serpents. The illusion of bit-mapped graphics is great, but all the drawings actually are done
with custom characters from a 25-by-80 window into the larger virtual text screen. The program allows vertical and
horizontal smooth scrolling throughout the map by using the cursor keys, allowing the user to tour FantasyLand. Help
screens are implemented with the EGA's split-screen abilities and scroll smoothly up from the bottom of the screen when
requested.

> To make the test even more rigorous, FantasyLand uses the EGA's switchable fonts to create animation effects.
The program loads several copies of a custom font into memory, and an interrupt service routine cycles through the
copies every four system clock ticks. Certain characters in the custom font have slight differences across the copies
so that, when cycled, they give the illusion of motion--a dragon flaps his wings, smoke billows from a chimney, grass
waves in the wind. By tying the animation directly to the system's 8253 timer interrupt, font switching happens
continuously, independent of CPU speed and divorced from other program operations. Rapid ongoing font changes, along
with fast smooth scrolling in both directions, test subtle timing dependencies between subunits of the EGA.

Due to the "very selective" distribution of the program, **FantasyLand** has been impossible to locate.
Even Cockerham seemed reluctant to tell us *too* much about the program.  My *guess* is that [Page 48](/documents/magazines/pctj/#pctj-1986-10)
of the October 1986 issue displays a zoomed-in section of a **FantasyLand** screen, but it's unattributed, so who knows.
If you come across a copy of **FantasyLand**, *please* let me know.

So, given that **FantasyLand** seemed unattainable, I next turned my attention to Cockerham's own **EGATEST**.

The [October 1986](/documents/magazines/pctj/#PCTJ-1986-10) issue contains the **EGATEST** program listing,
starting on Page 64, but who wants to type in all that code?  And while the issue -- like all our archived publications -- has
been OCR'ed, there's always a significant number of errors in the Optical Character Recognition process.

Another option would have been to download the code from PC Tech Journal's own "PCTECHline" -- if we were doing this
30 years ago.  Even back then, PCTECHline apparently wasn't the the most reliable service.  In fact, the very same
issue of [PC Tech Journal (Page 14)](/documents/magazines/pctj/#pctj-1986-10) contains the following "Update/Apology":

> **PCTECHLINE UPDATE**

> The telephone number for PCTECHline, now operating from our new Columbia, Maryland, office, has been changed to
301/740-8383. The PCTECHline number is always published in our masthead.

> Improvements to our system are planned. Six telephone lines have already been installed in our new lab for this
purpose; the lines will be put into service one by one as demand warrants. The bottleneck in our plan ning is our
fondness for PCTECHline's software; unfortunately, its current multiline capabilities are not to our liking. We hope
that better solutions are forthcoming from the vendor, Micro-Systems Software.

> Part of the plan is to increase the capacity and performance of the PCTECHline computer. We do not yet know how this
will be accomplished. One idea is to install an RT/PC that has the performance to handle at least six lines and the
necessary software (AIX) to control them. We would value the experience gained on the RT and users would benefit from
the expansion of services it would allow.
  
> We apologize for any disruption of service that may be caused by our move to Columbia or our experiments with new
equipment and service. As always, we invite your comments and suggestions for PCTECHline. --WF

As it turns out, the simplest means of obtaining all the code was finding it in another online archive.  A website
called [The Programmer's Corner](https://www.pcorner.com) contains a [Magazine File Archive](https://www.pcorner.com/list/MAG),
and in that archive, a file named [PCTJ1086.ZIP](https://www.pcorner.com/list/MAG/PCTJ1086.ZIP/INFO/) appears to
contain all of Cockerham's **EGATEST** files.

I've transferred the contents of that ZIP archive to a PCx86 diskette image named
"[PC Tech Journal (1986-10)](/software/pcx86/sw/magazines/pctj/#directory-of-pc-tech-journal-1986-10)", which we can now
load into the machine below, and then run "EGAMAKE.BAT" to rebuild the entire program.

### Building EGATEST

Unfortunately, as of this writing, while the **EGATEST** code *mostly* compiles, it encounters a few errors along the way
that I've not resolved yet (like a missing `TimeDate` module).  And the closest version of the compiler I was able to find
is [Logitech Modula-2/86 Compiler 1.10](/software/pcx86/lang/logitech/modula2/1.10/).  Cockerham doesn't mention what version
of the compiler he used, but it may well have been a newer version (2.00?), since that article was published almost two
years after version 1.10 was released.

I'm also at a bit of a disadvantage with Modula-2 itself: I've never written anything in Modula-2, I've never used
any Logitech compilers before now, and the closest documentation I've been able to locate is for
[Logitech Modula-2/86 Compiler 1.00](/software/pcx86/lang/logitech/modula2/1.00/) (the previous version).

On the other hand, maybe I'm trying too hard, because Cockerham provided the final binary as well: **EGATEST.EXE**.

How well does it work?  I must confess, I don't know, because I'm too chicken to try it right now.  I know my EGA
simulation, while good, is far from perfect, so before I dive into these tests, I want to make sure I have enough time
set aside to debug and fix the inevitable problems.

Anyway, the [Logitech Modula-2/86 Demo](/software/pcx86/lang/logitech/modula2/1.10/) machine has been recreated below,
along with the PCjs Debugger.  One nice thing about this configuration is that COM1 is connected to the Debugger's
output window, so you can use the MS-DOS command:

	CTTY COM1

to redirect all console I/O, making it easy to copy and paste the text for future reference.  And in fact, that's
exactly what I've done "below the fold".
