		The 5170 doesn't have DIP switches like previous models, but it still has a few switches and jumpers.

		First and foremost, there is a "Display Switch" near the battery connector that must be pushed "toward the
		front of your system unit" if you have a CGA that is your only (or primary) display adapter, or "toward the
		back of your system unit" if you're using an MDA as your only (or primary) display.

		We support the "Display Switch" setting with the *monitor* property, which you can set to either "mono"
		(aka "mda") or "color" (aka "cga").  However, unlike the model 5150/5160 DIP switches, we currently offer no
		UI for this switch, so it cannot be changed by the user.

		Second, there is the "keyboard inhibit switch"; it defaults to UNLOCKED and stays UNLOCKED, since no UI or
		configuration property is currently provided.

		Finally, there is a "manufacturing jumper" that can be installed, enabling additional diagnostic functions
		in the ROM; it defaults to UNINSTALLED and stays UNINSTALLED, since no UI or configuration property is currently
		provided.

		The rest of a 5170 machine's configuration is handled through CMOS settings, which PCjs configures automatically
		based on other settings (eg, the chipset's *floppies* property).
