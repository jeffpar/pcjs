## [SOFORECAST.BAS](#listing)

By Jeff Parsons

This was a small program that my dad "commissioned" me to write in the late 70's.  He worked for many years at the
Roseville Telephone Company in California, and the 1970's were probably challenging and exciting times for the company,
both in terms of keeping up with growth in the Roseville area and dealing with the rapidly changing technology, as the
telephone industry transitioned from mechanical to digital switching.

I don't recall the details, but this program appears to be a simple tool for forecasting some aspect of telephone
customer activity ("SO" was an acronym, perhaps for "Service Orders").
