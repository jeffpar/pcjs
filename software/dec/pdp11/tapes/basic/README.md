According to the [PDP-11/20 Handbook (1971)](https://1drv.ms/b/s!ArcO_mFRe1Z9gp5O19e4cBRGbdaWgw?e=yh41hu),
p. 160, notable features of PDP-11 BASIC included:

- Use of BASIC statements in immediate mode (no line number)
- Ability to use any BASIC command (RUN, LIST, etc.) in deferred mode (with a line number)
- Recursive subroutine calls
- Multiple statements on a single line
- Array names of a letter followed by a number
- User programs can be halted (with CTRL/P) without clearing variables; PRINT can then be used to examine values
- Ability to call assembly language functions

Debugging Notes
---------------

### PDPjs Debugger vs. SIMH

When I first tried to run BASIC in a PDPjs machine, it crashed almost immediately.  It was attempting to use memory
beyond the 16Kb of installed RAM.  After a bit of poking around, I found BASIC's memory sizing code here:
 
	016142: 012701 160000          MOV   #160000,R1
	016146: 022626                 CMP   (SP)+,(SP)+
	016150: 014111                 MOV   -(R1),@R1

The code sets R1 to highest possible RAM address and starts scanning backwards for the first valid memory location.
However, the scanning process wasn't clear to me at first glance, and the `CMP (SP)+,(SP)+` was a bit of a
head-scratcher, so I decided to do an instruction-by-instruction comparison with SIMH.

After cloning the [SIMH project](https://github.com/simh/simh) and building the *pdp11* binary, I created a *pdp11.ini*
text file that contained:

	ECHO Configuring PDP-11/20 with 16Kb of RAM...
	SET CPU 11/20
	SET CPU 16K
	
	; Throttle SIMH to limit CPU usage, heat and fan noise
	SET THROTTLE 5%
	
	; Disable devices that we don't need
	SET HK DISABLE
	; SET RHA DISABLE
	SET DZ DISABLE
	SET RL DISABLE
	SET RX DISABLE
	SET RP DISABLE
	SET RQ DISABLE
	SET TM DISABLE
	SET TQ DISABLE
	SET RK DISABLE
	
	; Enable the high-speed paper tape reader
	SET PTR ENABLE
	; SET PTP ENABLE
	
	ECHO Loading BASIC paper tape image directly into memory...
	LOAD DEC-11-AJPB-PB.ptap
	
	ECHO Setting breakpoint at 016142...
	break -e 016142

along with a *tr* text file that contained:

	step
	examine r0,r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,sp,psw

Then I ran *pdp11* and typed "g" to start the machine:

	PDP-11 simulator V4.0-0 Beta        git commit id: 592deb8f

	SP:	013660
	PSW:	000000	CM=K PM=K RS0 FPD0 IPL=0 TBIT0 N0 Z0 V0 C0 

After typing several "do tr" commands, I was surprised to see SIMH execution continually returning to this instruction:

	Step expired, PC: 016150 (MOV -(R1),(R1))
	
until I remembered that when the PDP-11 accesses an invalid address, it's supposed to trap to vector 000004, and that
BASIC must have modified vector 000004 to jump into the middle of this code.

This code fragment was simply marching down the address space until it reached an address that didn't trap.  The
odd-looking `CMP (SP)+,(SP)+` instruction was throwing away the PC and PSW that each trap pushed onto the stack, by
effectively adding 4 to SP.

The problem with PDPjs was that it wasn't generating a trap to vector 000004 when an invalid address was accessed.
After fixing that, I verified with the PDPjs Debugger that the memory sizing code was working properly:

I like to think that the PDPjs Debugger (and in fact, *all* PCjs Debuggers) is considerably simpler to use, and more
informative, too.  For example, when you're single-stepping ("t" or "tr"), the Debugger will alert you if the previous
instruction triggered a trap.

There are also a variety of diagnostic "bus" and "memory" messages that can be enabled, if you want to see more detail
about each instruction's operation; see the Debugger's "m" command for details.

### TRAP Handling

One of the first things I noticed when debugging PDP-11 BASIC was its heavy reliance on TRAP instructions.
For example, `TRAP 000` is used to output the character in R2 to the terminal.  Let's take a closer look at how
its TRAP handler works.

Since the trap vector for TRAP instructions is fixed at address 000034, we need to dump the contents of that vector:

	>> dw 034 l2
	000034  000100  000000  

This tells us that the BASIC TRAP handler is at 000100:

	>> u 000100
	000100: 011666 000002          MOV   @SP,2(SP)
	000104: 162716 000002          SUB   #2,@SP
	000110: 013646                 MOV   @(SP)+,-(SP)
	000112: 006216                 ASR   @SP
	000114: 103404                 BCS   000126
	000116: 006316                 ASL   @SP
	000120: 062716 073654          ADD   #73654,@SP
	000124: 013607                 MOV   @(SP)+,PC

When the code starts, the TRAP instruction has already pushed two words onto the stack:

	0(SP):  previous PC
	2(SP):  previous PSW

The first instruction, `MOV @SP,2(SP)`, copies the *previous PC* onto the *previous PSW*, which is where we'll
eventually want *previous PC*, so that the handler can eventually return with a simple `RTS PC`.

The next instruction, `SUB #2,@SP`, subtracts 2 from the original *previous PC*, so that it now points to the TRAP
instruction.

Then `@(SP)+,-(SP)` fetches the TRAP instruction while also "popping" the original *previous PC* and then "pushing"
TRAP instruction onto the stack, overwriting the original *previous PC*.

The next few instructions shift the TRAP right to see if bit 0 is set, and if it is not, then the TRAP instruction
is restored by shifting it left again, and then a large offset is added to it, transforming the TRAP instruction (which
is now known to be an *even* value) into a jump table index.

The final instruction, `MOV @(SP)+,PC`, moves the address at the jump table index into PC, while also removing the TRAP
instruction from the stack, leaving only the *previous PC* on the stack, so that when the TRAP handler is done, it can
execute `RTS PC` to return to the caller.
