The *PDP-10 KA10 Basic Instruction Diagnostic #13* (MAINDEC-10-DAKAM) test code has been extracted from
[DAKAMM.MAC](DAKAMM.MAC.txt) [[original](http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/klad_sources/01/klad.sources/dakamm.mac.html)] and
[DAKAMT.MAC](DAKAMT.MAC.txt) [[original](http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/klad_sources/01/klad.sources/dakamt.mac.html)]
for use with the [PDP-10 Test Machine with Debugger](/machines/dec/pdp10/ka10/test/debugger/) below.

This diagnostic "TESTS THE BYTE, BLOCK TRANSFER AND JFFO INSTRUCTIONS."

Information regarding this diagnostic includes:

- [Instructions](#dakamtxt)
- [History](#dakamhst)
- [Source Code](#dakammac)
- [MACRO-10 Listing](DAKAM.LST.txt)
- [Additional Information](https://1drv.ms/t/s!ArcO_mFRe1Z9gp1UjvF3CYoxNKl50Q)

{% include machine.html id="testka10" %}

The Debugger's assemble ("a") command can be used to test the new built-in
[MACRO-10 Mini-Assembler](/machines/dec/pdp10/lib/macro10.js), which supports a subset
of the [MACRO-10](https://1drv.ms/b/s!ArcO_mFRe1Z9gp1mkis_mCVuT1x1pQ) assembly language.

This command:

	a DAKAM.MAC

will automatically read the [DAKAM.MAC](DAKAM.MAC.txt) source file (a slightly modified copy of [DAKAMM.MAC](DAKAMM.MAC.txt)),
assemble it, and then load the binary image at the location specified in the file.

1.0	ABSTRACT

	THIS PDP-10 KA10 BASIC INSTRUCTION DIAGNOSTIC IS THE
	THIRTEENTH IN A SERIES OF PDP-10 KA10 PROCESSOR DIAGNOSTICS.
	THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THE BYTE, BLOCK TRANSFER AND
	JFFO INSTRUCTIONS.

2.0	REQUIREMENTS

2.1	EQUIPMENT

	A PDP-10 KA10 EQUIPPED WITH A MINIMUM OF 32K OF MEMORY

	PAPER TAPE READER 
	CONSOLE TELETYPE
	DECTAPE
	LINE PRINTER (OPTIONAL)

2.2	STORAGE

	THE PROGRAM RUNS WITHIN 32K OF MEMORY.

2.3	PRELIMINARY PROGRAMS

	PREVIOUS PROCESSOR DIAGNOSTICS

3.0	PROGRAM PROCEDURES

3.1	LOADING PROCEDURE

	THIS DIAGNOSTIC REQUIRES THAT THE DECSYSTEM10 SUBROUTINE
	PROGRAM BE RESIDENT IN THE PDP-10.

	PAPER TAPE - HARDWARE READ-IN (READER DEVICE CODE 104)
	DECTAPE - LOAD WITH DIAMON (DECTAPE DEVICE CODE 320)
	TIME SHARING - RUN UNDER DIAMON.
	
							MAINDEC-10-DAKAM.TXT
							PAGE 4

3.2	STARTING PROCEDURE

	A.  SELECT OPERATIONAL CONSOLE DATA SWITCH SETTINGS (REFER TO
	    4.0 DATA SWITCH FUNCTIONS).

	B.  EXEC MODE

	    STAND-ALONE STARTING ADDRESS IS 30000.

	C.  USER MODE

	    RUN UNDER "DIAMON".
	    IN USER MODE THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED TO 
	    SELECT THE OPERATIONAL SWITCHES:

		    TELETYPE SWITCH CONTROL ? 0,S,Y OR N (CR) -

		    IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "N", THE ACTUAL CONSOLE
		    SWITCHES ARE USED.

		    IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "Y", THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS
		    ARE ASKED AND THE OPERATOR RESPONDS BY TYPING
		    THE ANSWER AS SIX OCTAL DIGITS REPRESENTING
		    THE DESIRED SWITCH SETTINGS.

		    SPECIFY LH SWITCHES IN OCTAL-

		    SPECIFY RH SWITCHES IN OCTAL-

		    IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "0", ZERO'S ARE USED FOR
		    THE SWITCH SETTINGS.

		    IF THE OPERATOR TYPES "S", PREVIOUSLY SET SWITCHES
		    ARE USED.  THIS IS ONLY VALID UPON RESTARTING
		    OF AN INTERRUPTED PROGRAM.

							PAGE 5

3.3	OPERATING PROCEDURE

	A.  TO THROUGHLY TEST ALL HARDWARE, ALL TEST CONTROL DATA 
	    SWITCHES SHOULD BE SET TO 0.

	B.  WHEN DEBUGGING HARDWARE, SET SWITCHES TO 0.  ALLOW THE 
	    TELETYPE TO PRINT THE ERROR MESSAGES.  THIS ALLOWS THE 
	    PROGRAM TO RUN A COMPLETE PASS AND THEN THE ERROR MESSAGES
	    MAY BE CORRELATED TO QUICKLY DIAGNOSE THE FAILURE.  IF A
	    HARDWARE PROBLEM IS SUCH THAT THE ERROR MESSAGES, AFTER THE
	    FIRST ONE, HAVE NO MEANING (FIRST ERROR CAUSES ALL FOLLOWING
	    TESTS TO FAIL) SET THE LOOP ON ERROR SWITCH AND RESTART THE
	    TEST FROM THE BEGINNING.  THE FIRST FAILURE WILL THEN CAUSE
	    THE PROGRAM TO ENTER A LOOP SUITABLE FOR SCOPING.

	    THE ERROR MESSAGE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LISTING AND
	    SCOPING IF NECESSARY SHOULD ALLOW THE FAILING CONPONENT 
	    TO BE ISOLATED AND REPLACED AND/OR REPAIRED.

	C.  WHEN TAKING MARGINS, SET DATA SWITCHES 'NOPNT' AND 'DING'.
	    THIS WILL INHIBIT PRINTOUT BUT WILL ALLOW THE TELETYPE
	    BELL TO BE RUNG WHEN A ERROR OCCURS.  IF THE MARGIN OBTAINED
	    IS UNACCEPTABLE, THE OPERATOR MAY REVERT TO STANDARD SWITCH
	    SETTINGS FOR DEBUGGING PURPOSES.

	D.  ERROR INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED QUICKLY BY PRINTING 
	    ERRORS ON THE LINE PRINTER.

	E.  IN THE EVENT OF A PRINT ROUTINE FAILURE THE 'NOPNT' SWITCH
	    AND THE 'ERSTOP' SWITCH MAY BE SET TO INHIBIT PRINTOUT 
	    BUT HALT THE PROGRAM POINTING TO THE ERROR.

5.0	ERRORS

	ERRORS ARE PRINTED ON THE TTY OR LINE PRINTER.  THE ERROR 
	PRINTOUT CONTAINS THE TEST TITLE, THE PC OF THE FAILURE, ERROR
	NUMBER AND THE CONTENTS OF AN APPLICABLE AC.

	THE PC VALUE IS USEFUL IN RELATING THE FAILURE TO THE LISTING.
	THE ERROR NUMBER IS PROVIDED SUCH THAT AN ERROR DICTIONARY MAY
	BE MADE AT SOME FUTURE DATE.

	WHEN THE SCOPE LOOP MODE IS USED THE MI REGISTER WILL COUNT 
	FOR EACH OCCURANCE OF AN ERROR.  IF AN AUDIO INDICATION OF
	A CONTINUING ERROR IS DESIRED THE 'DING' SWITCH MAY BE SET.

6.0	ITERATION COUNTER

	THE ITERATION COUNT OF THE PROGRAM IS DISPLAYED IN THE MEMORY
	INDICATORS (MI).  THIS COUNT IS A DECREMENTING COUNT AND 
	INITIALLY STARTS AT -1 IN STAND-ALONE OPERATION.

7.0	CYCLE TIME

	THE CYCLE TIME OF THE PROGRAM IS IN THE MILLISECOND RANGE AND
	IS THEREFORE SUITABLE FOR TAKING MARGINS, VIBRATION TESTS,
	ETC.

8.0	OPERATIONAL VARIATIONS

	A.  DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR

	    THE PROGRAM IS USABLE WITH THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR TO PROVIDE
	    RELIABILITY TESTS, ACCEPTANCE TESTS, AND/OR TO PROVIDE A
	    QUICK METHOD OF ISOLATION OF A FAULT TO A PARTICULAR AREA
	    OF THE PROCESSOR.  CERTAIN PROCEDURES ARE USED WHEN THE
	    PROGRAM IS USED IN THIS MANNER.  THEY ARE:

	    1.	THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR TRANSFERS CONTROL TO THE PROGRAM
		AND STARTS IT AT LOCATION 30002.

	    2.	MONCTL - LOCATION 30043 IS USED AS THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR
		CONTROL WORD.
			LH = 0, STAND-ALONE OPERATION
			    -1, RUNNING UNDER DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR

			RH = RIGHT HALF OF CONSOLE SWITCHES IF UNDER
			     DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR CONTROL.

	B.  USER MODE

	    TO OUTPUT THE PRINTED ERROR MESSAGES TO A USER SPECIFIED
	    DEVICE IN USER MODE, ASSIGN THE DESIRED OUTPUT DEVICE TO
	    DEVICE NAME 'DEV' AND SET SWITCH 'PNTLPT'.  THE PHYSICAL
	    DEVICE USED CAN BE ANY DEVICE THAT CAN ACCEPT ASCII OUTPUT
	    FORMAT SUCH AS LPT, DSK, DTA, ETC.  THE CORRESPONDING 
	    OUTPUT FILE IS 'DAKAM.TMP'

	    EXAMPLE DEVICE ASSIGNMENT:

	    .ASSIGN DSK DEV

	    IN USER MODE THE PROGRAM WILL MAKE 1000(8) PASSES AND THEN
	    RETURN TO DIAMON COMMAND MODE.

							PAGE 9

8.0	OPERATIONAL VARIATIONS (CON'T)

	THE OUTPUT FILE (IF USED) MAY THEN BE LISTED BY USING THE
	NORMAL MONITOR COMMANDS (PRINT, LIST, TYPE, PIP, ETC.).

	IF THE PROGRAM IS ABORTED BEFORE COMPLETION (BY ^C, ETC.) THE
	OUTPUT FILE MAY BE CLOSED BY USING THE MONITOR 'REENTER' 
	COMMAND.

	C.  SYSTEM EXERCISER

	    START ADDRESS IS 30003.  DATA SWITCHES ARE PRESTORED IN
	    'SWTEXR' LOC 30023.

9.0	MISCELLANEOUS

	THE NON-EX-MEMORY AND PARITY STOP SWITCHES SHOULD BE RESET 
	(0).  THESE ERRORS, ILLEGAL UUO'S AND OTHER ERRORS OF THIS
	TYPE ARE HANDLED BY PRINTOUT ON THE TELETYPE.
