## Information about "FILE!"

    "All I want is a simple text editor!"  You got it -- FILE! is a
    convenient text editor designed for editing small batch files, your
    CONFIG.SYS file, and your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Very few features to bother
    with, but enough: edit lines, delete lines, swap lines, and cripple
    (REM) a file line.  Maximum file size to load and print is 100K.  Ideal
    when using the phone to help a remote user revise critical batch files.
