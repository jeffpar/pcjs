## Information about "GARC'S UTILITIES"

    Need to find a name or other text in a long file?  Set up print
    parameters for your Epson compatible printer?  Choose screen colors on
    CGA, EGA and VGA systems?  Or find a BBS phone number quickly and
    easily?  If so, GARC'S for you!
    
    Give TEXTSRCH a filename and the text, name or data you are trying to
    locate.  Go warm your coffee and by the time you get back, this
    program will have numbered the lines in your file and listed those
    which contain the text you are searching for.
    
    EPSET offers you a nifty collection of batch commands to set the print
    parameters on the Epson MX, LX and FX series.  One command, TINY.BAT,
    produces the smallest print you've ever seen from your dot matrix!
    EPSET works with most Epson compatibles, but experiment first.
    
    COLORSET displays a chart of available colors from which you can
    choose your screen settings on CGA, EGA and VGA systems.
    
    FINDBBS provides you quick access to hundreds of bulletin board
    systems' (BBS) phone numbers across the nation.  Dial up and log-on. It
    also serves as the BBS search door for WILDCAT! BBS (PC-SIG disks # 745,
    746).
