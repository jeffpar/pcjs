## Information about "HYTEXT"

    HYTEXT brings hypertext -- the latest development in computer
    learning and information retrieval -- within the means of every
    interested author, teacher or electronic publisher.
    
    HYTEXT, using the new hypertext technique and electronic texts, may be
    the solution to the age old problem of forcing a reader to wade through
    an article or book sequentially, line-by-line, page-by-page.  HYTEXT
    allows for skipping, dodging and darting along a reader's interest or
    learning curve.
    
    Hypertext enables an author of computerized texts to designate specific
    words as hot words, highlight them in the text, and link them to
    related topics, footnotes, explanations or other programs.  Readers can
    then instantly jump off from the main article or chapter at any of the
    hot words to delve deeper into subjects they need refresher information
    on or want to study further, and then jump back to where they were
    reading.
    
    For example, the sentence, "Amphibians of the Amazonian rain forest
    have survived relatively unchanged for centuries," might generate
    several hypertext jumping off points for the reader interested in
    knowing more about amphibians, the Amazon or rain forests.
    Authors need no longer worry about being too technical and losing the
    beginner, or too simple and boring for the more advanced.  Readers are
    able to obtain just the right level of information they need, when they
    need it.
    
    Hot words are displayed as highlighted text which may be selected using
    the cursor control keys.  Readers simply point-and-shoot to go off on
    new tangents of learning.  The Enter key is used to jump to
    the next topic.  The End key is used to return to a previous topic.
    
    HYTEXT uses simple control codes imbedded in any document to create
    hypertext links or scripts.  These scripts are maintained using a text
    editor or word processor.  Authoring tools such as file/path info, trace
    mode and hot word search are provided.  An individual hypertext may span
    multiple files.
    
    Several hypertext levels are supported:
    
    ~ Topics containing hot words
    
    ~ Cards for notes, definitions, etc.
    
    ~ External text to link to other documents
    
    ~ External programs to link to other programs
