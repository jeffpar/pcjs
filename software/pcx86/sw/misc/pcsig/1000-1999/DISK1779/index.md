## Information about "THE PROGRADE SYSTEM  2 OF 2 (1778)"

    THE PROGRADE SYSTEM is a full-featured grading program for educators.
    It was designed by an educator and has been rigorously tested by
    "non-computer expert" educators to meet their specific needs.  The
    documentation manuals are complete.  Once you've read the documentation
    and figured out how the system works, you will find that the system's
    power and flexibility is worth the time it takes to learn.
    
    THE PROGRADE SYSTEM will accept letter or numerical grades and lets YOU
    decide the letter grade numerical equivalents.  THE PROGRADE SYSTEM lets
    you enter grades in ANY order -- any assignment for any student at any
    time.  THE PROGRADE SYSTEM calculates weighted grades or unweighted
    grades, points, percents, or letter grades.  And every floppy disk can
    store dozens of class files, each with up to 35 students, 45 assignments
    per student.
    
    PROGRADE computes class averages, comparisons of grades, ranked or
    alphabetical class lists, averages of all tests, homeworks, etc.  It
    will provide individual progress reports with averages for all
    assignment categories.  Your students and their parents can know where
    they stand at all times, and you can, too.
