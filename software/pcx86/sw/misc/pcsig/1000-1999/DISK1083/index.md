## Information about "CODE-BLUE"

    If you tend to make long distance telephone calls during periods of
    computer use, CODE-BLUE (CB) might be able to save you some of those
    annoying telephone company directory assistance fees!
    
    CODE-BLUE is an on-line telephone area code reference system.  No
    documentation is provided, or needed, with this system.  It lets you
    cursor-select a state and get its telephone area code.  For larger
    states, CB breaks down the area code listings to the city level.  These
    city listings tend to include all the major population centers, but for
    area codes of smaller cities you will still have to call long distance
    information.

If you tend to make long distance telephone calls during periods of
computer use, CODE-BLUE (CB) might be able to save you some of those
annoying telephone company directory assistance fees!

CODE-BLUE is an on-line telephone area code reference system.  No
documentation is provided, or needed, with this system.  It lets you
cursor-select a state and get its telephone area code.  For larger
states, CB breaks down the area code listings to the city level.  These
city listings tend to include all the major population centers, but for
area codes of smaller cities you will still have call long distance
information.  While CB isn't particularly fast, then again, neither is
looking up an area code in the telephone directory!
