## Information about "RECIPE INDEX SYSTEM"

    The RECIPE INDEX SYSTEM lets you index your recipes and then search
    through that index to quickly locate the names of recipes containing
    specific ingredients or of a certain category. It does not store the
    actual recipes themselves. You enter the principal ingredients of each
    recipe, not the steps used to create the food. The reports created by
    the search function do not create shopping lists or give portion size.
    
    The RECIPE INDEX SYSTEM is completely menu-driven and fully documented.
    The most common use of this software is by people who have many
    cookbooks and food journals. They enter the name of the recipes they
    like, the ingredients, a source (name of book or journal) for the recipe
    (including page number), and category and style fields. When they use
    the search function to look for recipes that meet certain criteria, the
    source and page number information are used to find complete details
    about the recipe. This saves having to enter into the computer endless
    details that are already in the books and journals.
    
    Although originally designed to work with food recipes, this system can
    also index other concerns -- like contents of drawers and storage boxes,
    or books and the major topics they cover. Any endeavor that can be
    broken into entries and subparts (like ingredients) can be indexed. You
    could even use it to track the contents of video tapes.
