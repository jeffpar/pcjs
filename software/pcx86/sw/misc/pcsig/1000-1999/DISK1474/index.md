## Information about "PICTURETHIS 2 OF 4 (1130, 2301, 2302)"

    Quickly and easily prepare professional-looking drawings for printing
    on PostScript-compatible laser printers and imagesetters with
    PICTURETHIS.  Do them either freehand or by tracing ``template''
    screens captured with a companion program, CAPTURETHIS.
    
    Use PICTURETHIS even if you don't know how to program in the
    PostScript page description language.  View a screen representation of
    your drawing as you prepare it, easily making additions and
    alterations.  Print PICTURETHIS drawings at lower resolution on some
    dot-matrix printers, using the graphics screen dump program supplied
    with DOS.
    
    PICTURETHIS doesn't need a lot of fancy hardware -- just an IBM PC, XT,
    AT, or compatible.  It doesn't even require direct access to a laser
    printer.  Drawing files can be sent by mail or modem to a laser
    typesetting service bureau for overnight return of low-cost prints with
    300, 1270, or even 2540 dots-per-inch resolution.

           Gravel Switch, KY 40328 U.S.A.

         Trademarks/Owners: PictureThis/Patricia Y. Williams and
           Gregory Williams; PostScript/Adobe Systems Inc.

         NOTE: Carefully read all of the terms and conditions of the
           License Agreement (near the beginning of the READTHIS.1ST
           file on distribution disk #1) PRIOR to using the
           PictureThis and/or CaptureThis programs. USE OF THE
           PROGRAM(S) INDICATES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE TERMS AND
           CONDITIONS.


         Some keys mentioned below have different names (or no names
           at all) on certain keyboards.

         In general, a key has the same effect whether or not Shift
           is pressed simultaneously, and whether CapsLock is
           toggled on or off. Exceptions to this are Del on the
           Numeric Keypad and the number keys on the numeric keypad
           and the main keyboard, which have different effects
           depending on whether NumLock is toggled on or off and/or
           whether Shift (or, in some cases, Ctrl) is pressed (see
           below).

         A beep means that an invalid key has been pressed (unless
           the computer's speaker has been toggled off with H).

         Alphanumeric keys are used to specify file names and to
           respond to menu prompts; press BackSpace (repeatedly if
           necessary) and retype to correct; press Enter to complete
           a response (no Enter is needed for responses to menu
           prompts).

         Some prompts require a (Y/N) response. In these cases,
           pressing Y or y means yes, and pressing any other key
           means no.

         Some prompts require a (Y/N/ESC) response. In these cases,
           pressing Y or y means yes, pressing Esc cancels the
           current operation and usually "backs out" to previous
           operation, and pressing any other key means no.

         ? = access contextual help screen

         Esc = cancel current operation and (in most cases) "back out"

                                                                           2
                 to the previous operation (will access prompt for
                 exiting from PictureThis if pressed enough times);
                 when Quickshow screen is being drawn, stops drawing

         F1 = set endpoint at current cursor location; special uses
                during transformations of objects and in some other
                situations

         F2 = move cursor from one control point to other control
                point of curve being drawn (after both of its
                endpoints have been set); if drawing oval or square,
                move cursor to other guideline; special uses during
                transformations of objects

         F3 = set curve (after its endpoints and control points
                have been set); special uses during transformation of
                objects and in some other situations

         F4 = access curve modification menu (erase, change, or alter
                line parameters)

         F5 = begin curve cutting

         F6 = access trail menu (define, erase, alter line
                parameters, alter fill, or copy object to endpoints)

         F7 = access object menu (group, ungroup, erase, layer, move,
                copy, scale, rotate, flip, incline, or alter global
                parameters)

         F8 = access text menu (edit, set parameters, delete text
                block, cut text block back to editor, set margin,
                or choose margin with + or - or Space)

         F9 = access miscellaneous menu (set palette, move template,
                scale drawing, set grid, set aspect ratio, set
                flatness, set units, or set cursor movement
                increments)

         F10 = access file operations menu (get drawing file, save
                 drawing file, import clip art file, export clip art
                 file, read template file, write encapsulated
                 PostScript file, shell to DOS, or use data from file
                 for plotting)

                                                   key from 5 key

         Ins on numeric keypad = toggle cursor movement increment
                                   between low cursor speed and high
                                   cursor speed

                                   or -); press Enter to leave

                                           other noted points, press

           We find that cursor control is more precise with keyboard
         input than with a mouse, mainly because we can count key
         presses. Nevertheless, you can use a mouse with PictureThis
         if you want.
           Included on one of the PictureThis distribution disks are
         two text files for defining Logitech mouse functions:
         PTLOGI3B.DEF and PTLOGI2B.DEF. If you have a recent-vintage
         Logitech mouse, you also should have Logitech Plus software,
         including two files called NEWMENU.EXE and MENU.COM. Refer to
         your Logitech Mouse User's Manual for instructions on how to
         create a menu file from PTLOGI3B.DEF or PTLOGI2B.DEF (perhaps
         modified by you) by using NEWMENU.EXE, and on how to load the
         menu file by using MENU.COM. Also included on a PictureThis
         distribution disk are the menu files corresponding to each
         definition file: PTLOGI3B.MNU and PTLOGI2B.MNU; either menu
         file can be loaded (provided you have already loaded your
         mouse driver) by using MENU.COM.
           What's the difference between PTLOGI3B.* and PTLOGI2B.*?
         The former is for a three-button mouse, and the latter is for
         a two-button mouse, although both can be used with a three-
         button Logitech mouse. With very little effort, you should be
         able to use the PTLOGI2B.DEF file to make a menu file for a
         Microsoft mouse or a mouse which emulates either the Logitech
         or the Microsoft mouse -- for more details, consult your
         mouse manual.
           Both PTLOGI3B.* and PTLOGI2B.* translate horizontal mouse
         movements into horizontal cursor movements, and vertical
         mouse movements into vertical cursor movements.
           PTLOGI3B.* translates a press of the LEFT mouse key into
         function key F1 (set endpoint), a press of the MIDDLE mouse
         key into function key F2 (change control point), a press of
         the RIGHT mouse key into function key F3 (set curve), and a
         simultaneous press of ANY TWO OR ALL THREE mouse keys into
         ESC (back out of the current operation).
           PTLOGI2B.* translates a press of the LEFT mouse key into
         function key F1 (set endpoint), a press of the RIGHT mouse
         key into function key F2 (change control point), and (on a
         two-button mouse) a simultaneous press of BOTH mouse keys
         into function key F3 (set curve) or (on a three-button mouse)
         a press of the MIDDLE mouse key into function key F3 (set
         curve).

         INTRODUCTION

           This guide provides a very brief overview of PictureThis
         (and CaptureThis) -- just enough information to enable you to
         begin exploring the program on your own. For more details,
         see the user manual and/or the tutorial.
           In a nutshell, here's how you'll be using PictureThis:
         While viewing their on-screen representations, you prepare
         drawings consisting of curves, specifying each curve by the
         locations of its endpoints and by the locations of "control
         points" which determine its shape. You can fill (gray-shade)
         areas bounded by curves, and you can manipulate groups of
         curves ("objects") to generate complex drawings. PictureThis
         produces files written in the PostScript page description
         language; these files contain all of the information about
         your drawings needed by PostScript-compatible laser printers
         and imagesetters to generate high quality prints. While
         PostScript files are thus the "ultimate products" of
         PictureThis, several other kinds of files are involved in the
         production process, including template files, drawing files,
         clip art files, data files for two-dimensional plotting, and
         font files of various types. CGA (medium- or high-resolution)
         graphics screens can be captured in template files by using
         the CaptureThis (or Alternate CaptureThis) program provided
         with PictureThis; the template files can then be imported
         into PictureThis to provide background screens for tracing.
         Drawing files are used to store and retrieve information
         about your drawings in a format usable by PictureThis (which
         can't read PostScript); you can save a drawing-in-progress in
         a drawing file for later recall. Clip art files are used to

                                                                           2
         save parts of drawings for later use in other drawings.
           If your computer has a Hercules-compatible monochrome
         graphics board, you can run PictureThis and CaptureThis ONLY
         WITH SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE CGA GRAPHICS EMULATION. Several CGA
         graphics emulation programs are currently available (some
         marketed as "shareware"), and some monochrome graphics boards
         include built-in CGA graphics emulation. EGA and VGA boards
         emulate CGA graphics to various degrees; see the PictureThis
         user manual for more information if you have any problems
         with such boards when running PictureThis or CaptureThis.

         SEVEN STEPS TO EXPLORING PictureThis

         1. The files REQUIRED to run PictureThis are the following:

           PICTHIS3.EXE (the PictureThis program)

           PTS3T.OVR (a data file needed by PictureThis; must be in
             the current directory)

           PTS3D.OVR (another data file needed by PictureThis; must be
             in the current directory)

           and, if you want to use text features,

           PT3EDIT.HLP (a help file)

           PT3FONT.HLP (another help file)

           FONTNNNN.* (font information files, with NNNN = a number
             between 1 and 9999 and * = FIN, FNM, or FKN)

           STANDARD.SFT, SYMBOL.SFT, and ZAPFDB.SFT (screen font
             files)

           and, OPTIONALLY,

           CAPTHIS.COM (the CaptureThis program; needed only if you
             want to capture CGA graphics mode screens for use as
             templates in PictureThis)

           or

           ACAPTHIS.COM (an alternate version of the CaptureThis
             program which requires no keyboard input to capture CGA
             graphics mode screens; useful for some computers with
             compatibility problems and with some applications
             programs which "take over" the keyboard)

           You might also like to use some of the sample PictureThis
         files: *.DRW, *.TMP, and *.CLP.

         2. For reference, print out a copy of the file listing the
         special keys used in PictureThis (KEYS.TXT).

         3. (OPTIONAL; if you DON'T want to capture CGA graphics mode
         screens for use as templates in PictureThis, skip this step
         and go to step 5.)
           To install the memory-resident CaptureThis program, at the

                                                                           3
         operating system prompt (i.e., "A>") corresponding to the
         drive containing the disk with CAPTHIS.COM, key in "CAPTHIS"
         and then press Enter. A message noting that CaptureThis has
         been installed should appear, and the DOS prompt should
         return.
           Any time after CaptureThis has been installed, the current
         graphics mode screen (medium- or high-resolution CGA) from
         most applications programs can be saved to a file by pressing
         Shift PrtSc. After these keys are pressed, CaptureThis checks
         your computer's BIOS to determine the current video mode; if,
         according to the BIOS, the mode is CGA text, NOT CGA
         graphics, then a warning message appears at the top of the
         screen: "NOT CGA GRAPHICS! Try Capture? (Y/N)"/"ESC to exit."
         NO message appears and a normal screen dump to a printer is
         attempted if the video mode is NOT CGA text or CGA graphics.
         Caution: if a printer is not connected, or if it is turned
         off, your computer might hang up. For a graphics mode screen
         dump, you must have installed a memory-resident graphics
         printer driver program appropriate for the graphics mode
         (such as GRAPHICS.COM, supplied with PC-DOS for dumps of CGA
         graphics screens to IBM-compatible dot matrix printers) PRIOR
         to installing CAPTHIS.COM.
           Occasionally, an applications program will program the video
         controller chip directly for CGA graphics, but fail to update
         the BIOS; if the screen looks like CGA graphics even though
         CaptureThis has determined (from the BIOS) that it SEEMS to
         be CGA text (so that the warning message appears), you can
         still try to capture the screen in a template file for
         importing into PictureThis by pressing Y. Then respond to the
         prompts which follow. We recommend that you use the extension
         ".TMP" for template files. If the captured screen isn't CGA
         graphics, its file produces "garbage" when imported into
         PictureThis.
           Or, if you want a screen dump to a printer, press N.
         Caution: If a printer is not connected, or if it is turned
         off, your computer might hang up. For a graphics mode screen
         dump, you must have installed an appropriate memory-resident
         graphics printer driver program PRIOR to installing
         CaptureThis.
           Alternatively, to proceed without capturing or dumping the
         screen, press Esc. If, according to the BIOS, the current
         video mode IS CGA graphics, a different message appears:
         "Perform Screen Capture? (Y/N)"/"ESC to exit." To capture the
         screen in a template file for importing into PictureThis,
         press Y. Then respond to the prompts which follow. Directory
         specifications can be used for files. Again, we recommend
         that you use the extension ".TMP" for template files.
           Or, if you want a normal screen dump to a printer, press N.
         Caution: If your printer is not connected, or if it is turned
         off, the computer may hang up. For a CGA graphics screen
         dump, you must have installed a memory-resident graphics
         printer driver program appropriate for the graphics mode
         PRIOR to installing CaptureThis.
           Alternatively, to proceed without capturing or dumping the
         screen, press Esc.
           Directory specifications can be used when keying in file
         names. Each template file takes about 16 KB.
           If CaptureThis doesn't work correctly with your computer
         (an example is the Zenith Z-100 running ZPC) or with

                                                                           4
         particular programs (examples are those which "take over"
         the keyboard), you should try the Alternate CaptureThis
         program instead. Once installed, this program doesn't require
         any keyboard input other than Shift PrtSc to capture CGA
         graphics mode screens, and thus will work even with programs
         that "take over" the keyboard (unless they take over the
         Print Screen interrupt; to date, we've found only one program
         that does this: The Newsroom Pro).
           To install Alternate CaptureThis, at the DOS prompt
         corresponding to the drive containing the disk with
         ACAPTHIS.COM, key in "ACAPTHIS" and then press Enter. A
         message noting that Alternate CaptureThis has been installed
         should appear, and the DOS prompt should return. Any time
         after Alternate CaptureThis has been installed, you can
         capture a medium- or high-resolution CGA graphics screen by
         pressing Shift PrtSc.
           If Alternate CaptureThis determines (from your computer's
         BIOS) that the current video mode is NOT CGA graphics, it
         performs a normal screen dump to a printer. Caution: If a
         printer is not connected, or if it is turned off, your
         computer might hang up. For a graphics screen dump, you must
         have installed a memory-resident graphics printer driver
         program appropriate for the non-CGA graphics mode PRIOR to
         installing Alternate CaptureThis.
           If, according to the BIOS, the current video mode IS CGA
         graphics, Alternate CaptureThis captures the screen in a file
         named "A0.TMP" (in the current directory). Subsequently
         captured screens are saved in files having the following
         sequence of names:

           A1.TMP, ..., A9.TMP, B0.TMP, ..., B9.TMP, ..., C0.TMP, ...

         Caution: Each time ACAPTHIS is installed, it saves screens in
         files (beginning with A0.TMP) WRITING OVER ANY EXISTING FILES
         IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY WITH THE SAME NAMES WITHOUT WARNING
         -- so after saving a series of files with ACAPTHIS, you
         should rename them before installing ACAPTHIS again, to guard
         against overwriting, and to provide more descriptive names.

         4. To run PictureThis, make sure that PTS3T.OVR and PTS3D.OVR
         are both in the current directory. At the DOS prompt
         corresponding to the drive containing the disk with
         PICTHIS3.EXE, key in "PICTHIS3" and then press Enter. If you
         have a Hercules-compatible video card with software or
         hardware emulation of CGA, pressing Tab immediately following
         Enter might prevent your computer from hanging up (see the
         user manual for more information). The title screen should
         appear for a few seconds, allowing you to get a preview of
         PictureThis in action. Then a copyright/ordering information
         screen should appear. Please read it! After fifteen seconds,
         you can press any key to continue. When you press a key, a
         blank screen with a border and an X-shaped cursor at its
         center should appear.
           Contextual help screens showing currently valid keys can be
         accessed by pressing ?.
           If you hear a beep, it means that you just pressed an
         invalid key.
           You might find it helpful at first to toggle on special
         error messages and prompts; do this by TWICE pressing H.

                                                                           5
           Now the fun begins! To draw a curve, you define its (two)
         endpoint locations, and then you define the locations of its
         "control points" (again, two of them, one associated with
         each endpoint) to shape the curve as you wish. The basic
         drawing sequence is given below:

           Move cursor to desired location for curve's first endpoint,
             using any of the numeric keypad keys 1 through 4 and 6
             through 9 (NumLock must be toggled off). The cursor
             movement increment (its "speed") can be toggled between 1
             and 10 pixels with the Ins key.

           Press F1 to define location of curve's first endpoint.

           Move cursor to desired location of curve's second endpoint.

           Press F1 to define location of curve's second endpoint.

           Move cursor to move control point associated with second
             endpoint (which is initially at second endpoint's
             location), thus altering shape of curve.

           Press F2 to switch cursor to control point associated with
             first endpoint (which is initially at first endpoint's
             location position).

           Move cursor to move control point associated with first
             endpoint, thus altering shape of curve.

           Press F2 to switch cursor to other control point.

           Repeat steps for switching between and moving control
             points until curve's shape is as desired.

           Press F3 to define curve. Note that the cursor moves to the
             curve's second endpoint, to facilitate drawing of
             successive connected curves.

           To define a straight line, simply move to where you want
         one of its endpoints, press F1, then move to where you want
         its other endpoint and press F3.
           As you can see from the list of special keys used in
         PictureThis (KEYS.TXT), you can draw boxes and ovals, alter
         previously drawn curves, work at different scales, move the
         cursor directly to a previously defined endpoint, draw
         connecting curves "smoothly" (tangent at their shared
         endpoint), etc., etc. You can even "cut" a previously drawn
         curve into two curves, thus obtaining a new "middle" endpoint
         which can be used as an endpoint for subsequently drawn
         curves. You also can fill groups of curves, combine groups of
         curves into "objects" and manipulate these objects in various
         ways (scaling, moving, copying, rotating, etc.), change the
         line thickness and gray shading of curves, work in different
         units or on a grid, view an on-screen representation of the
         PostScript output, etc. And, of course, there is text --
         which can manipulated in endless ways, yet remains editable!
         The possibilities are described in detail in the user manual,
         but we invite you to EXPERIMENT now by pressing various keys
         to see what they do. You can't hurt anything by pressing an

                                                                           6
         invalid key -- usually, you'll just hear a BEEP and nothing
         else will happen. If you toggled on special error messages,
         sometimes one of these messages will appear along with a
         BEEP. And you usually can access a help screen showing
         currently valid keys (by pressing ?). Learning via trial and
         error can be very effective, but if you aren't that
         adventurous, the tutorial (TUTOR1.TXT and TUTOR2.TXT) offers
         a more structured approach to PictureThis.

         5. To import a template file into PictureThis for tracing,
         press F10. In response to the menu box which then appears,
         press R. And in response to the prompt for a file name,
         press Enter. A directory listing with all of the *.TMP files
         in the current directory appears. Highlight the one you want
         by using the cursor keys, then press Enter.
           You can use a template file you created previously with
         CaptureThis or Alternate CaptureThis, or you can use a sample
         template file from one of the distribution disks. Importing a
         template file automatically replaces any previously imported
         template.
           Similarly, you can access the same menu with F10 to save
         and recall PictureThis-format drawing files, to save and
         recall clip art files, and to save "encapsulated" PostScript
         files for delivery to laser printers and imagesetters. We
         suggest that you use ".DRW," ".CLP," and ".EPS" as extensions
         for drawing files, clip art files, and encapsulated
         PostScript drawing files, respectively. Samples of all of
         these kinds of files (with the suggested extensions) are
         provided on the distribution disks.

         6. You'll need to work out your own methods for delivering
         encapsulated PostScript files produced by PictureThis to
         "desktop publishing" page layout programs and laser printers
         or imagesetters -- parallel and serial direct connections,
         indirect modem uploading, sending disks -- the number of
         possibilities is enormous! Consult software and laser printer
         user manuals and dealers, typesetting service bureau staff,
         and media reports for the latest, least expensive techniques.

         7. Use the Esc key to "back out of" an operation. Press the
         Esc key enough times, no matter where you are in the
         program, and you'll see the prompt to exit from PictureThis.

           If you have questions or problems, you should consult the

         DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REGISTERED AND "SHAREWARE" VERSIONS

         NOTE: Carefully read all of the terms and conditions of the
           License Agreement (near the beginning of the READTHIS.1ST
           file on distribution disk #1) PRIOR to using the
           PictureThis and/or CaptureThis programs. USE OF THE
           PROGRAM(S) INDICATES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE TERMS AND
           CONDITIONS.


           There are ONLY four differences (besides the names of the
         programs and their data files) between the Registered and
         "Shareware" Versions of the PictureThis program which are of
         consequence to users, and the CaptureThis and Alternate
         CaptureThis programs are IDENTICAL for both Versions. This
         means that TEMPLATE FILES CAN BE USED WITHOUT MODIFICATIONS
         WITH BOTH THE "SHAREWARE" AND REGISTERED VERSIONS. DRAWING
         FILES MADE WITH THE "SHAREWARE" VERSION WILL WORK WITH THE
         REGISTERED VERSION, BUT SOME (LARGE) DRAWING FILES MADE WITH
         THE REGISTERED VERSION WILL NOT WORK AT ALL WITH THE
         "SHAREWARE" VERSION.

         DIFFERENCE 1: OPTIONAL BYPASSING OF INITIAL SCREENS

           Registered Version users have the option of bypassing the
         initial (title and copyright/ordering information) screens
         when loading PictureThis. Bypassing the screens not only
         saves time, but also disk space: if you're sure you'll be
         bypassing the screens every time you load the program, you
         DON'T need to keep the PTR3D.OVR and PTR3T.OVR files (which
         contain data for the initial screens) in the current
         directory. (If you try to run PictureThis WITHOUT bypassing
         the initial screens and with the data files missing from the
         current directory, you'll see an error message, and the
         program won't load.)
           To load PTR3.EXE and bypass the initial screens, at the DOS
         prompt corresponding to the drive containing the disk with
         that file, key in "PTR3" and press Enter. Then, if you have a
         Hercules-compatible monochrome graphics card with software or

                                                                           2
         hardware CGA emulation, you might need to press Tab
         immediately to prevent lock-up of your computer (see the user
         manual for more details). It won't hurt to press Tab if
         you're not sure about your graphics card; the result is just
         a slight slowdown of text-mode screen writing. Whether or not
         you pressed Tab, next press Esc. If you press Esc too late,
         you'll see one or both of the initial screens (assuming that
         their data files are in the current directory). Pressing Esc
         while the title screen is displayed causes the
         copyright/ordering information screen to be bypassed;
         pressing any key other than Esc (or Tab, prior to Esc) before
         or while the title screen is displayed causes
         copyright/ordering information screen to go away as soon as
         it is fully displayed. Pressing any key while the
         copyright/ordering information screen is displayed causes
         that screen to go away as soon as it is fully displayed.

         DIFFERENCE 2: CONFIGURING MEMORY FOR MORE CURVES PER DRAWING

           You can configure the Registered Version of PictureThis to
         allow more curves, endpoints, and objects per drawing than
         allowed by the "Shareware" Version. Both Versions have user-
         settable configurations for pixel memory. Each configuration
         number (1 to 5) indicates approximately how much of the
         screen can be covered with curves and/or text: 1 indicates
         that about 1/6 of the screen can be covered, 2 indicates that
         about 2/6 (or 1/3) of the screen can be covered, etc. Letters
         A to H are used to indicate how many curves, endpoints, and
         objects may be drawn; the default configuration for both
         Versions is 3A. The "Shareware" Version can be configured
         with 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, or 5A; the Registered Version can be
         configured with 1 to 5 AND A to H. H allows up to 2000 curves
         per drawing, whereas A allows only 250 curves per drawing.
         Consult the user manual for additional information.
           Which memory configurations are possible for you depends on
         how much total memory your computer has, minus how much
         memory is needed by DOS and by memory-resident programs you
         have installed -- in other words, how much free memory is
         available. You can determine both total and free memory by
         running the DOS "CHKDSK" program (see your operating system
         manual for details). You can run any configuration of
         PictureThis which needs LESS than the amount of free memory
         available. PictureThis also requires some additional free
         memory while running; in particular, text operations can
         require substantial memory able to be allocated AFTER the
         program has loaded.
           To run PTR3.EXE, at the DOS prompt corresponding to the
         drive containing the disk with PTR3.EXE, key in "PTR3" and
         then press Enter (possibly followed by Tab; followed by Esc
         if you want to bypass the initial screens).
           At start-up, the program looks for a configuration file,
         PICTHIS.CFG, in the current directory. If it finds such a
         file, then it uses the configuration specified by that file.
         If it fails to find such a file, or if there is an error
         reading the file, then the default memory configuration (3A)
         is used.
           Where does the configuration file come from? To run
         PTR3.EXE with other than the default memory configuration, at
         the DOS prompt corresponding to the drive containing the disk

                                                                           3
         with PTR3.EXE, key in "PTR3 XX" (where "XX" is the
         designation for the desired configuration, such as "3A" or
         "5B"); then press Enter (possibly followed by Tab; followed
         by Esc if you want to bypass the screens). When the program
         loads, it creates PICTHIS.CFG, a very small file containing
         the configuration designation just keyed in and the saved
         aspect ratio. (If PICTHIS.CFG cannot be created, because of a
         bad, full, or write-protected disk, an error message will
         appear. After you press a key to make the message go away,
         PTR3.EXE will continue loading.)
           Thus, when there is a PICTHIS.CFG file in the current
         directory (containing a configuration designation specified
         when PTR3.EXE was previously loaded), you can subsequently
         run PictureThis with that configuration simply by keying in
         "PTR3" and then pressing Enter (possibly followed by Tab;
         followed by Esc if you want to bypass the screens)

         DIFFERENCE 3: SUPPORT FOR ALL POSTSCRIPT FONTS WITH AFM FILES

           The PostScript fonts which the "Shareware" Version of
         PictureThis can use are limited to the Times family, Symbol,
         and Zapf Dingbats. The Registered Version includes a utility
         program to make PictureThis-usable font information files
         from any PostScript font's AFM (Adobe Font Metrics) file (on-
         disk). Included on the distribution disk are ready-made font
         information files for the 35 fonts most often resident in
         PostScript printers, so you don't need their AFM files (which
         AREN'T included with the printers, although they are
         available on disk direct from Adobe Systems Inc.). Any
         downloadable fonts you use should come complete with AFM
         files -- if they don't, complain to the vendor! If you are
         using downloadable fonts at a service bureau, the bureau
         should give you on-disk copies of the AFM files for those
         fonts. In other words, the Registered Version of PictureThis
         should work with virtually all PostScript fonts.

         DIFFERENCE 4: PHONE AND/OR MAIL SUPPORT FOR USERS

           Users of the Registered Version of PictureThis can call or
         write AT THEIR EXPENSE for prompt assistance. We CANNOT
         accept collect phone calls or postage due letters.
