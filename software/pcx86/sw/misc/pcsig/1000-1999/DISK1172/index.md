## Information about "DMAIL"

    DMAIL makes advanced mailing list functions a snap because of its new
    pull-down menus.  DMAIL makes mailing list management a breeze.  Create
    any number of master and subsidiary lists, tag addresses with key
    words,
    sort on any of nine fields and target mailings down to the city block.
    Print addresses directly on envelopes if you prefer not using computer
    labels.  It also prints Rolodex cards as well as two different kinds of
    quick-reference lists.  If you are sending personalized letters DMAIL
    will also create name and address files for Word Perfect, Microsoft Word
    and Wordstar.
    
    DMAIL makes it a snap to identify and locate those individuals in a
    master list who have something (anything) in common.  Through the key
    word tagging feature you can automatically create a sub-list of people
    who satisfy any condition you choose.  Lists can be joined, split, and
    sorted according to your particular needs.
    
    DMAIL is being used by institutions and businesses that need to
    organize
    mailings to as many as 15,000 people.  It eliminates repetitive typing,
    and has added reporting features, and a streamlined envelope printing
    function.  It is completely menu-driven.  The number of addresses
    stored
    is limited only by disk space.
    
    Features include:
    
    ~ Copy selected addresses from one list to another.
    
    ~ Target your mail by City, State, Zip Code, Area Code, key word etc.
    
    ~ Classify addresses with key words or your own coding system.
    
    ~ Perform key word searches and duplicate checking.
    
    ~ Print with any dot matrix or daisywheel printer.
    
    ~ Print addresses on one-up or two-up labels.
    
    ~ Print from 1 to 99 copies of each label.
    
    ~ Automatically record mailing date when addresses are printed.
    
    ~ Redirect printer output to a disk file.
