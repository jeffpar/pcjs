## Information about "YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR"

    YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR is a versatile financial management package with
    major financial modules -- loan calculator, equity calculator,
    amortization table generator, and financial planner.
    
    The loan calculator allows you to calculate monthly loan payments based
    on interest, loan amount, and the loan term.  (You can enter any three
    of the values and the module will calculate the fourth value.)  A
    payment table is displayed to reflect the interest or term change on
    your loan payment.
    
    The equity calculator keeps track of the equity in your home and
    calculates the amount you can borrow against your home and keep the
    interest tax deduction.
    
    The amortization module generates an amortization table of loan
    payments for each payment, a table displays the amount of the payment
    that goes towards the interest and the amount that covers the principle.
    Prepayments and balloon payments can be included.
    
    The financial planner performs annuity, present value and future value
    calculations for your investments.  This module provides specific
    tables for retirement planning, college cost planning, and IRA planning.
    
    YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR has an additional feature for professional users
    which allows you to print your name, address, and phone number on all
    hardcopy reports. The program is completely menu-driven and has pop-up
    help screens for all modules.
