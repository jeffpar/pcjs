## Information about "GAME FUN FOR ALL"

    LAS VEGAS EGA CASINO is a package of games that use the special features
    of your EGA monitor.  Included are: Las Vegas Casino Black Jack, Las
    Vegas Video Poker, and Las Vegas Dollar Slots (MicroBucks).  You can
    choose any of the three games to play from the program menu.  It has
    great graphics and is so realistic you forget you're playing a computer.
    
    XWORD lets you quickly create a crossword puzzle that can be saved to
    disk and printed.  The crossword puzzle size can be from 15x15 to 23x23.
    You enter words with the cursor onto the puzzle grid.  Afterward, the
    words can be "deleted," with the word placed on a "move" list where it
    can be recovered and placed in another location. This program maintains
    word lists for across and down, and clues which you can see at any time.
    XWORD lets you enter words on the puzzle grid even before the clue list
    is made. After you finish your puzzle, the program lets you print a
    blank crossword puzzle, a clue list, and the solution to the puzzle.
    Your crossword puzzle can be saved to disk. Thus, the amount of
    crossword puzzles you can create is limited only by disk space and your
    own imagination.
    
    CASTLE DROGANYA is a reactive adventure game.  The course of the game is
    dictated by your response to the situation.  The goal is to free the
    souls of the townspeople who have been trapped by the evil Lord
    Droganya.
    
    LIAR'S POKER is a game utility that simplifies playing Liar's Poker, a
    betting game in which each player's "hand" is a dollar bill serial
    number.  The program generates random numbers that can be substituted to
    play the game.  It keeps records on disk for up to 20 "liars"
    (players), each liar having up to 20 numbers which can be printed or
    displayed on the screen.
