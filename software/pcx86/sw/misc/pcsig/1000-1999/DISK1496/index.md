## Information about "CHARTS UNLIMITED"

    CHARTS UNLIMITED integrates graphics and text processing into a single
    system to allow creation, editing, and printing of flow charts,
    organization charts, floor plans, electrical diagrams, Gantt charts,
    business forms, and many other documents.  Highly versatile, CHARTS
    UNLIMITED is valuable to engineers, architects, programmers, system
    analysts, teachers, and anyone with a need to draw charts.
    
    Charts are drawn on a worksheet 256 columns wide up to 1,000 rows long,
    a graphics area of four million pixels or dots.  A few keystrokes will
    bring up various geometric shapes, bar graph designs, flowchart arrows,
    math symbols, and more.  They can be displayed, moved, stretched,
    shrunk, saved, and replicated.
    
    Text can be entered anywhere as lowercase, uppercase, or boldface with
    most text editing features.  You can load text files from spreadsheets
    and wordprocessors into your chart.
    
    Most dot matrix and laser printers are supported.  You can print your
    chart horizontally or vertically.  A magnification feature allows you to
    expand your chart or a portion of it up to 100 times.  A printer buffer
    lets you go on creating or editing a chart while you print another one.
