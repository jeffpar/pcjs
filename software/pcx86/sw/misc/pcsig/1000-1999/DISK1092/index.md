## Information about "MONODRAW & SCNDSIGN"

    MONODRAW provides full-screen 740x348 pixel monochrome graphics
    uncluttered by on-screen menus.  All the features commonly available in
    ``paint'' programs are included.  Full-screen resolution is maintained
    by keeping the intuitive menus in a separate window that is readily and
    instantly accessible.  Full documentation is provided.
    
    In Turbo Pascal, designing screens for inputting data is often a very
    tedious task.  However, with SCNDSIGN you can design with very little
    effort, creating screens on the monitor exactly as they'll appear in
    your program.  Then, SCNDSIGN handles the complicated part of creating
    the source code in Turbo Pascal.  The screens can also be saved for
    later use.
