## Information about "PIG"

    All those who thought "Pig Out" only meant eating too much
    during the Holidays will be in for a surprise with Raymond Buti's
    simple, but delightful game called PIG.  You take on the computer by
    rolling a single die, trying to reach the score of 100 or 200.
    You can accumulate a score as long as you don't roll a "1"--but if you
    do, you are awarded the title of PIG and loose all points
    scored up until that point!  First to reach 100 or 200 is the winner
    and receives 10X the points ahead of the other player minus 5
    points for each "Pig" received during play.  Points accumulate
    after each round.
    
    PIG is an exciting game for all ages.  Anyone with an interest in dice
    games should enjoy it.  Fun for the whole family, PIG will keep you
    occupied for hours as you try to match your wits with those of the
    computer.
