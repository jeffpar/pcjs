## Information about "PERSONAL APT"

    Want to learn Numerical Control programming?  This exciting and
    expanding field can be opened to you with PERSONAL APT.  Need
    programming help?  With its totally integrated working environment,
    including screen editor and graphic tool path display, PERSONAL APT is
    very helpful in teaching and learning this exciting and expanding field
    and yet powerful enough for significant industrial productivity
    improvement.
    
    APT (Automatically Programmed Tools) is the oldest and most widely used
    Numerical Control programming language in use today.  APT development
    was initially sponsored by the US Air Force, and later the AIA
    (Aerospace Industries Association), and has evolved into a universal
    programming language.  PERSONAL APT is a subset of this powerful
    programming language, but is powerful enough to handle most
    requirements.
    
    The minimum hardware requirements and features of PERSONAL APT make it
    an ideal program for schools and individuals to use in teaching and
    learning the APT language.
    
    PERSONAL APT can be a very productive tool for engineers, draftsmen and
    others who spend time on complex mathematical and geometric
    computations.  PERSONAL APT provides preprogrammed functions for the
    solution of intersection and tangency problems, transformation of
    dimensional data between coordinate systems and vector functions to aid
    computations.
