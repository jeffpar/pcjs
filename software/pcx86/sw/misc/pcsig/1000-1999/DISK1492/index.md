## Information about "CRYSTAL BALL"

    When and where will disaster strike? What will be a future scientific
    development and what good will it do? What will make international
    headlines? Who will win future elections?
    
    Welcome to the first psychic computer program. Like human psychics,
    CRYSTAL BALL generates predictions about the future and answers any
    question you may wish to ask. Unlike human psychics, CRYSTAL BALL
    generates its predictions entirely at random. It makes no claim for
    accuracy. Nor does CRYSTAL BALL claim that what it says will make
    sense. But that's why it's fun. Just type in your question and sit back
    and watch for the answer on the screen. Great for New Year's Eve
    parties!
