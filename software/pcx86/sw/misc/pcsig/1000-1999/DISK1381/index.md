## Information about "FACT PACK"

    FACT PACK is a pair of programs, TABLE and FACTRACE, designed to
    sharpen basic arithmetic skills (addition, subtraction, multiplication
    and division) for students in grades 1-8.
    
    TABLE displays a multiplication or addition table minus the answers.
    The computer chooses problems at random which the student then
    calculates. The size of the table can be expanded to larger sums and
    products.
    
    FACTRACE gives a timed quiz on a mix of addition, multiplication,
    subtraction and division problems. A report is generated of the
    problems answered correctly, the problems attempted, the percentage of
    correct answers and any errors made.
    
    Both programs run in practice and test modes. In practice mode, the
    student can work on a problem at a leisurely pace. In test mode, both
    programs provide exciting challenges for the students as they race the
    computer in finding the answers.
    
    FACT PACK supplies both fun and motivation for younger learners, and is
    an excellent tool for providing basic math skill drills.
