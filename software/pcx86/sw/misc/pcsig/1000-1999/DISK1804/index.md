## Information about "BJ-FILES"

    Easily create and maintain an inventory list of all those disks you
    have laying around. Now you can know exactly what's on them.
    BJ-FILES will record every file and what disk it's on. You can also
    use this program to provide a nice listing of the files on your hard
    disk, including a listing of duplicate files.
    
    BJ-FILES automatically reads directory information from hard disks and
    floppy disks, and builds an inventory of your files. It updates the
    inventory by rereading the same disks. Several reporting options are
    available with your choice of output type (screen display, ASCII file,
    or printer).
    
    Other features include optional changing of volume labels and an
    30-character description for each disk. Reports can be generated with
    all files listed by disk and subdirectory, all files by file name, all
    files for one specified disk, or all disks and subdirectory locations
    for one specified file. Wild cards are optional for one file or one
    disk reports. User-selectable items from the inventory may be written
    to a delimited ASCII file for use in database software.
