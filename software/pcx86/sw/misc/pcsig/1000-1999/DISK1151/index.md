## Information about "ROAM A DOS SHELL"

    ROAM is a DOS shell, an easy-to-use interface that insulates you
    from the complexities of DOS.  It makes it easier to enter commands and
    manage files.  ROAM helps organize and control a hard disk and makes it
    possible for you customize its organization to fit individual user
    needs.
    
    Instead of displaying confusing information, (e.g., cluster size and
    other technobabble), ROAM breaks down the process into two distinct
    modes, depending on what you are doing.  The first is an enhanced
    command line, similar to, but easier to use than the DOS command line
    and the second is a directory/file screen where you can easily
    navigate through disk directories, files, and drives.
    
    ROAM grows with you as you develop your computer skills.  While an
    experienced programmer can make use of its more advanced capabilities,
    a newcomer immediately gains a beneficial, easy-to-use tool.
