## Information about "FBNCAT"

    Here's a disk cataloger with pull-down menus, full search and sort
    capabilities by disk and file, and the power to print disk labels.
    Enter disk and file comments and save for later editing. Pull up
    reports on your own library, then edit the cataloger to keep it
    current.
    
    FBNCAT was designed to be easy to use. The menus and dialogue boxes
    are self-explanatory and extensive context-sensitive help screens are
    included. At any point that help is required, simply press F1 and a
