## Information about "PMCAT +"

    Finally, a nice looking disk cataloger. PMCAT+ is designed to allow
    you to arrange, track, and sort the file information DOS stores in the
    directories of any hard drive or multiple diskettes.
    
    Detailed linking makes file searching and organization a snap. You can
    keep track of your disks, every file on those disks, or the layout of
    your hard drive. Categorize and organize your collection however you
    want, with as much detail as you need. Although PMCAT+ was originally
    intended to be used with small to moderate (50 - 200 diskettes)
    catalogs, it is quite capable of managing truly huge diskette
    collections.
    
    PMCAT+ offers a DOS shell for command execution and has the ability to
    read, de-archive, and catalog files that have been archived in .ARC,
    .ZIP, .LZH, and .PAK formats.
