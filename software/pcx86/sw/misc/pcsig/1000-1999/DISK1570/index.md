## Information about "PEN PAL"

    Is it a mailmerging text editor that works great as an address
    manager?  Or is it a super address manager for business or personal use
    that also automates mass correspondence?  Or is it the perfect printing
    utility that lets you print Rolodex cards, envelopes, labels, and more a
    from the same program?  It is all of these things and none the worse for
    being so versatile.
    
    With PEN PAL you don't have to worry about getting your wordprocessor to
    talk to your database and vice versa.  This is a truly integrated system
    that takes out the middleman.  Even the ambitious beginner can be mass
    producing letters the first time through the program.  You will find
    features that help you improve your correspondence, such as the ability
    to customize the salutation for each individual in your database.  It is
    completely menu-driven for fast effective use and the screen design is
    easy to follow.  You can save up to 99 different letters on file for
    future editing and use.  The program even supports common database
    formats for easy data exchange into other programs should you need them.
    
    Before you go to all the trouble of building a database/wordprocessing
    system and configuring it all for custom printing, consider PEN PAL.
    The work may already be done for you.
