## Information about "DB-VCR"

    Have you ever found yourself searching through a zillion video tapes to
    figure out which tape has, let's say, "Top Gun" on it?  And when you
    find it, you have to fast forward for about 10 or so minutes to find out
    where it starts on the tape?  Well, here is the answer you've been
    waiting for.
    
    db-VCR helps you keep track of all your videos, whether they are
    movies, instructional videos or music.  The program maintains a database
    of all your VCR tapes with titles, comments, where each entry on each
    tape starts, and so forth.  db-VCR is completely menu-driven, letting
    you easily add entries, search for and view specific titles and print
    sorted lists of your collection.  Mouse support is also provided. db-VCR
    looks great on color systems and the menus are wonderful.  It is so easy
    to use that it actually makes using the program fun.
