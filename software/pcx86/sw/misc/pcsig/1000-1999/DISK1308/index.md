## Information about "PULLED FROM THE LIBRARY"

    SUPERCAL and EGACAL are calendar programs that let you keep track of
    dates and print out monthly and yearly calendars.  Both programs are the
    same, but EGACAL takes advantage of EGA monitors and displays 43 lines
    on the screen.  When first started, the program reads the date from DOS
    and immediately shows the month and puts the cursor in the box for that
    day.  Holiday and history information for every day of the year can be
    displayed, and the programs can also print out a yearly calendar on one
    sheet of paper for any year after 1903.
