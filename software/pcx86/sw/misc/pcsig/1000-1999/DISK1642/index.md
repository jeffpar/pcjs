## Information about "POKER CHALLENGE"

    Poker players, here are two games that will hone your skill while giving
    you lots of enjoyable practice.  In Stud, you play against seven
    computer opponents -- all smart and shrewd.  In Texas Hold 'Em, you play
    against nine computer opponents who have lots of savvy.  But Poker
    CHALLENGE does give you a break; poke a hot key and your odds of winning
    are instantly displayed on the screen, along with an abundance of
    information about the hand.
    
    Not only are these games for the thoughtful, serious player, they also
    move fast enough to keep the beginner delighted.  In fact, you can take
    advantage of the fast deal and then use the plus and minus keys to play
    the game so fast you can barely keep up with the moves.  All face up
    cards are drawn on the screen, showing their ranks and suits.  You
    control the ante and betting limits.  For poker pros and amateurs, POKER
    CHALLENGE is a winner.
