## Information about "DENTAL P.M.S. 5 OF 5 (1251 THRU 1255)"

    DENTAL PATIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DPMS) tracks treatments and manages
    accounts receivable, insurance, patient billing, and follow-up
    information. Insurance company information, complete patient
    information, and procedure details are integrated. Information need be
    entered only once; data from insurance forms is automatically posted to
    a patient's account receivable records. DPMS uses common computer
    forms such as an attending dentists statement and the NEBS patient
    billing form. Entering a patient procedure automatically updates
    billing information  including charges. Invoicing can be done in four
    keystrokes.
    
    DPMS's biggest strengths are patient tracking and generating written
    and telephone follow-up reminders, as well as inactive patient lists.
    Patient files can be read by most wordprocessors to generate labels and
    form letters. Most routine procedures are included, and more can be
    added.
