## Information about "TREEVIEW"

    Getting lost in your hard disk forest of files?  Climb a tree, with
    TREEVIEW, to easily find your way about and make file operations a
    breeze.
    
    Called up by a hot key, TREEVIEW displays disk and directory contents
    in up to six windows. Perform operations, such as deleting, on
    several files in several directories at once and select files by time,
    date, or extension. A simple tree display graphically shows your
    directory structure, allowing you to zip about your files in ways you
    never thought possible. On-line help is available from anywhere in the
    program and an on-disk user guide provides in-depth instruction.
    
    A "show-all" and "show-sub" display lets you access all files on the
    current disk as if they were in one directory. A file-viewing function
    displays files as ASCII text or hexadecimal format to permit use of
    listing and editing programs. Offering full mouse support, TREEVIEW
    exploits DOS command line macros to let users access complete file and
    directory pathnames using just one or two characters. Screen colors are
    user-selectable.
