## Information about "MMSORT & MMREPORT DOCS"

    MMSORT and MMREPORT are two utilities for sorting and creating reports
    and labels from data in FILEBASE database files and existing mailmerge
    files.
    
    MMSORT sorts and provides for sort-merging mailmerge files on the basis
    of any numeric or character field, in ascending or descending order.
    Special sort features such as specific sorting on part of a field,
    character sorts and date sorts help to make a tedious job easier.
    
    MMREPORT generates reports and labels for mailmerge files, and can also
    select records on the basis of field contents.  Fields can be
    selectively printed from each record.  When printing labels, you may
    print 1, 3 or 5 labels across, with optional multiple copies of each
    record.  MMREPORT can also set up special print styles for printing.
