## Information about "MASS APPEAL"

    MASS APPEAL doesn't just address envelopes and print mailing labels, it
    creates mail merge files for all the major word processors, dials the
    phone, allows you to disable fields you don't need, and utilizes macros
    to speed data entry, and reduce errors.  Many powerful features found
    only in high-end multiuse databases have been fully integrated into MASS
    APPEAL such as field default values, copy fields from the previous
    entry, and advanced sort capabilities.
    
    MASS APPEAL is a fully menu-driven program, requiring little or no
    knowledge of database management programs.  All the "grunt" work has
    been done for you, allowing you to concentrate on maintaining your
    mailing list.  Don't worry about how to generate a report -- reports
    are plentiful.
    
    A companion program Zipp Appeal, PC-SIG disk #1921, allows you to enter
    the name of the city and state by simply typing the zip code.  Or you
    type the city and the zip code is found.
