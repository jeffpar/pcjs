## Information about "MOSAIX  DISK 1 OF 2"

    MOSAIX is a computerized jigsaw puzzle program that turns photographic
    quality color images into puzzles. The puzzles presented by MOSAIX may
    be created using a video image capture board, a black and white scanner,
    or a color scanner. Since MOSAIX can import standard PCX graphics
    files, puzzles may also be created using almost any PC paint program.
    Whether you scan your own PCX graphics files, create them in a paint
    program, have personal photo's scanned, or use included PCX files,
    you'll have high quality screen images in your jigsaw puzzles.
    
    For those who do not have access to a color scanner or digitizing
    equipment, MOSAIX creators, Data Assist, provide a color image scanning
    service. Scan in your own photographs and custom create personal
    jigsaws. Since MOSAIX displays actual color pictures for its puzzles, a
    VGA, MCGA or EGA graphics system is highly recommended. The use of a
    mouse is optional.
