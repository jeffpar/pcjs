## Information about "GRADEASE"

    Let GRADEASE do a teacher's dirty work.  This software will calculate
    grades, print out class lists, print seating charts and gradebook pages,
    and print a summary of grades and progress reports for each student.
    The program can handle as many separate classes as your disk can hold.
    
    For each class, you may have up to seven separate grading categories.
    These categories can be divided between quizzes, tests, homework, etc.,
    and you may define categories that will not count in the final grade.
    
    GRADEASE has several grading options.  The program can calculate the
    overall grade for each grading category, with the final grade based
    either on the averages of these grades or on the weights of those
    averages.  Each category of grades can be weighted by percentage or
    multiples.  Missing grades may or may not be included in the final
    grade.  You may drop the lowest grade or change all grades below a
    certain score.
    
    GRADEASE can print out an immediate seating chart with the students
    arranged alphabetically or randomly.  The student list may be updated
    and can be sorted alphabetically or by an assigned group number.
    
    Spend your time teaching and let GRADEASE do the bookkeeping for you.
