## Information about "IDEA TREE"

    IDEA TREE is a unique brainstorming/organizing tool that lets you
    examine, expand and organize your thoughts on any subject.  IDEA TREE
    lets you structure your ideas like a tree.  Add ideas to the tree
    anywhere, then rearrange and reorganize them as you change your mind
    and new thoughts take shape.  Focus on the development of one part of
    an idea by identifying related elements and making them into a
    separate tree.  When you are finished, move or copy this new tree back
    into the original.
    
    You can attach up to 1200 characters of notation to an individual
    idea.  A note stays with an idea as you move or copy it from one place
    to another.  You can also export notes to your favorite wordprocessing
    program and format them any way you want.
    
    Use IDEA TREE to create, structure, analyze and document reports,
    books, catalogs, projects and processes, business procedures,
    organizational structures, job analyses, database planning, system
    architecture...there's really no limit.
    
    IDEA TREE installs painlessly and comes with in-depth documentation,
    drop down menus and clear tutorials.  If you're interested in ideas
    and organizing ideas, you'll be interested in IDEA TREE.
