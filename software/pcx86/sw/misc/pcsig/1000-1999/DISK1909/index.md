## Information about "GRAPH"

    GRAPH allows you to generate a myriad of strange two-dimensional shapes
    by plotting two individual waveforms on a cartesian (or two
    dimensional) plane, even if you don't understand the math behind how it
    works!
    
    Most of the shapes this program produces are by nature abstract.
    However, with some practice it is possible to gain a talent for
    creating shapes that are easily recognizable to us as familiar objects.
    
    From the main screen you will fill four boxes with basic trigonometric
    waveforms, their durations and amplitudes.  Each one of these boxes
    makes up one user controlled "oscillator."  Despite the technical
    terms,
    GRAPH looks (and acts) a lot like a video game, because the "controls"
    are easy to operate and the program in itself is extremely interactive.
    
    The program is then ready to plot.  Relax and enjoy the show, you'll be
    entertained and may even learn something.
