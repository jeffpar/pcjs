## Information about "AMORTIZATION CALCULATOR"

    Thinking of taking out a loan on your house, or buying a new house?  Let
    the AMORTIZATION CALCULATOR calculate and print the payment amount and
    schedule for you.
    
    Calculate loans of up to $500,000 for a term of up to 480 months (40
    years).  Taxes and insurance costs can also be entered as needed to
    calculate the total monthly payment, giving you a true monthly payment
    amount.  Since all loan information is on the main screen and is
    updated
    as you enter amounts and rates, you automatically see the results of
    your loan. This is great if you are interested in doing "what-ifs" to
    find the right loan.
