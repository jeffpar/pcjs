## Information about "PAL"

    PAL is a handy scheduling tool, as well as a to-do list generator.  PAL
    shows you sorted lists of upcoming appointments to help you use your
    time more efficiently and remember vital appointments.
    
    PAL maintains a to-do list which prods you if you fail to do something
    after a specified date.  You can set a virtually infinite number of
    alarms.  PAL automatically repeats appointments and deletes old
    appointments.  Secular and religious holidays are automatically
    displayed.  You can also display calendars for any month in the 20th or
    21st century.
    
    Help is on-line from any place in the program.  PAL can also interface
    with SIDEKICK appointment files.
