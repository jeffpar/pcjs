## Information about "MI-LOG"

    MI-LOG adds two valuable features to your computer: multiple password
    control of computer access and automatic recording of PC usage by user,
    time, and purpose.  The bottom line is access security, the information
    needed to document business use of your PC for tax deductions, and a
    powerful tool to measure worker productivity.
    
    Each user may be assigned his or her own password.  You can then
    display or print a report that tells you who used the PC according to
    date, time, hours, reason for use (business or non-business), and
    specific purposes of each use.  MI-LOG also gives you cumulative totals
    of hours for each use.  The program is not memory resident and will not
    affect any resident programs.
