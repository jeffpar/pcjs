## Information about "DUNGEON"

    Grab your torch and sword and step into the DUNGEON, a game in which you
    must explore a maze of pathways leading into the bowels of the earth,
    while fighting monsters, seeking treasure, and hoping to find your way
    back out alive!
    
    Similar to HACK (PC SIG disk #1000), symbols and letters are used to
    represent you, the maze and its denizens, so you don't need a graphics
    card to play. But don't let it's simple graphics fool you.  This is an
    incredibly complex and intriguing game that can trap you for long hours
    before you can battle free.
    
    You use the curser keys to move and the function keys to cast 40
    different spells, such as: cast fireballs at monsters, teleport, pass
    through walls, find traps, transmute the air into gold, summon a demon,
    and more -- gadzooks!  You start off with six character attributes,
    which determine your capabilities during the game.  As you gain
    experience, you will be able to cast more spells, and live longer when
    fighting with monsters.  As you explore each dungeon level, a map is
    displayed on the screen, showing your position among the many hallways.
    At any time on-line help is available, giving a summary of all the keys
    and their functions.  Age level: 10 to adult.
