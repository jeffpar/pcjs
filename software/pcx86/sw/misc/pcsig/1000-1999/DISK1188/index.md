## Information about "POINT & SHOOT BACKUP/RESTORE"

    Finally a program that makes backing up your hard disk so simple you'll
    wonder why you didn't buy POINT & SHOOT BACKUP/RESTORE sooner.
    
    POINT & SHOOT BACKUP/RESTORE is a companion program for the POINT &
    SHOOT HARD DISK MANAGER (PC-SIG disk #930) but can also be used as a
    stand-alone product.  It provides fast, easy backups of your hard disk
    data to floppy disks. Your involvement is minimized in the backup and/or
    restore process.  If you own a hard disk, POINT & SHOOT BACKUP/RESTORE
    is a necessity.
    
    POINT & SHOOT BACKUP/RESTORE currently supports the following functions:
    
    ~ Up to 10 user-defined backup configurations, each of which may contain
    a list of up to 10 subdirectory backup sources.  Each backup source
    directory may include trailing directories for complete flexibility in
    backup definitions
    
    ~ Each backup definition allows selection of matching file specs,
    modified files only, optional disk formatting and optional file
    compression during the backup process.  A graphic directory tree display
    assists in the selection of backup source directories
    
    ~ Files remain intact on backup disks (except when disk boundaries must
    be crossed, or compression is used)
    
    ~ Required number of backup disks are automatically calculated
    
    ~ Restoration options include source drive, restoration to other than
    the original path, prompts for duplicate or modified files, and
    selective file restoration.  Again, a graphic directory tree assists in
    selection of restoration paths and files to restore
    
    ~ Configuration options include colors, an hourly chime, and drive
    designations
    
    ~ Backup speeds approach 1 Megabyte per minute with 1.2 MB or 1.44 MB
    disks, 0.5 Megabyte per minute with 360K or 720K disks.
