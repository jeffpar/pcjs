    A truly easy to use checkbook manager -- really intuitive. BANKBOOK was
    designed to make the management of your home finances easy and automated
    in a way that doesn't require an accountant to understand.
    
    BANKBOOK makes the presentation of your home finances look just like
    your checkbook entries, and adds automated support for bill payment and
    budget analysis.
    
    ~ Print checks on your PC printer.
    
    ~ Enter checks you have handwritten.
    
    ~ Enter ATM (automated teller) and EFT (electronic funds transfer)
    transactions.
    
    ~ Enter deposits from a variety of sources.
    
    ~ Go back in time to enter checks you wrote over the past several
    months to set up a history of spending trends.
    
    ~ Define a list of bills that you pay each month so they will be
    printed automatically on the proper date.
    
    ~ Associate each check with a spending category so you can divide your
    expenses into meaningful groups for later analysis.
    
    ~ Print reports and view displays of spending trends in various ways to
    see YTD spending patterns or patterns over other periods of time.
