## Information about "DATAMICRO'S PROPHET"

    LOTTO PROPHET has been completely redesigned, rewritten and expanded to
    become a very complete lottery software package. Point-and-shoot
    screens and well-documented programs make it nice to look at and easy to
    use. The best just got better. PROPHET is a lottery statistical
    compiler and forecaster.
    
    The program has four main parts:
    
    ~ Allows for file control, update, editing, and it sorts and prints the
    files showing repeat numbers
    
    ~ Produces statistical reports based on the most frequent numbers,
    current HOT numbers, numbers that have appeared the most with other
    numbers, and numbers that have appeared the most in a specific month.
    Prints prophet cards, graphs, trend charts, and more.
    
    ~ Stores numbers and checks for winners for up to three different
    lotteries at a time. Each lottery can have eight players, with up to
    six scores each. Prints a report on the players and their scores plus
    the results of the drawing--four out of six, etc. Great for groups of
    players.
    
    ~ Selects numbers for you with the Prophet's Prognosticator, if you
    prefer, and expresses an opinion of them. Works on all the state
    LOTTOS, Australian Gold and Canadian 6/49.
    
    LOTTO PROPHET can help you predict, store and check your numbers using
    the latest scientific methods or you can let the opinionated randomizer
    pick them for you. Good fun!

Program Title: DATAMICRO'S PROPHET version 2.7
PC-SIG version:  1.4

LOTTO PROPHET has been completely redesigned, rewritten and expanded to
become the most complete lottery software package on the market today.
New point and shoot screens plus additional well documented programs
make it nice to look at and easy to use.  The best just got better.  The
PROPHET is a lottery statistical compiler and forecaster.  The program
has four main parts:

(1) Allows for file control, update, editing and sorts and prints the
files showing repeat numbers.

(2) Produces statistical reports based on the most frequent drawn
numbers, current HOT numbers, numbers that have appeared the most with
other numbers and numbers that have appeared the most in any certain
month.  Prints prophet cards, graphs, trend charts, etc...

(3) Stores numbers and checks for winners for up to 3 different
lotteries at a time.  Each may have eight players, each player can have
6 scores.  Prints the players and their scores plus the results of the
drawing - 4 out of 6 etc... great for groups of players.

(4) If you desire, the Prophet's Prognosticator will select numbers for
you and even scroll out a definite opinion of them, easily switching
from 3 pick back to 6 pick etc.  Works on all the State LOTTOS,
Australian Gold, Canadian 649 etc...

LOTTO PROPHET can help you predict, store and check your numbers using
the latest scientific methods or you can let the opinionated randomizer
pick them for you.  This program is fun and entertaining.
