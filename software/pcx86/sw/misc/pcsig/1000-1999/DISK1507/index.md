## Information about "XYSEE 1 OF 2 (1508 ALSO)"

    Teachers will welcome this computer-aided instructional system when
    designing interactive tutorials and tests for high school and college
    level algebra, geometry and trigonometry.  At last, here's a method for
    time-crunched teachers and concerned parents to provide special,
    individualized help for the struggling student and enrichment for the
    advanced student!
    
    XYSEE enhances students' understanding by incorporating high resolution
    graphics to help them visualize the curve represented by a given
    equation, and the effect upon the form of the curve when parameters
    within the equation change.  Tackles such subjects as points and lines,
    intermediate quadratics and trigonometrics, and advanced parametrics and
    composites.  In addition, interactive coverage is extended to forms
    such as triangles, user defined polygons (structured spline and
    free-form), and designs utilizing artistic mathematics.
    
    XYSEE's game module challenges the student to solve puzzles consisting
    of graphic representations of standard formulae.  Imagine the
    excitement of a "Math Bee" or "College Bowl" pitting opposing teams in
    solving puzzle sets exhibiting complexities from ho-hum to horrific.
    The student's progress in solving each piece of the puzzle is displayed
    and special help is available for identifying boundaries and zeroing in
    on solutions.  Teachers will appreciate the performance reporting
    module which tracks solution attempts by the student as well as
    difficulty levels attained.
    
    The secret of this menu-driven instructional system lies in its use of
    macros which allow the instructor to formulate problems which
    demonstrate mathematical principles.  All of XYSEE's macros, data-sets,
    and puzzles may be prepared with the "smart" capabilities of its fully
    integrated application sensitive editor.  The intuitive structure and
    automatic validation abilities of the editor endow even casual users
    with the ability to quickly create scripts of any level of complexity.
    
    System features include moving window displays, function-specific
    statistics, auto-scaling, and context-sensitive help screens.  With
    progressive overlays and multiple import facility, the package offers
    plot enhancement techniques, and sound and color control.  Both graphic
    and non-graphic printers are supported.  A demonstration tutorial
    highlights program features and an extensive and well-written
    instruction manual is included.
