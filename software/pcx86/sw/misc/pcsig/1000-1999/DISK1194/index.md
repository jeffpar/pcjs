## Information about "MEGAGOPOLY"

    MEGAGOPOLY is a game of high finance.  The scenario: you have just
    inherited $100,000, now make millions more in the next 20 years.
    MEGAGOPOLY gives you the opportunity to create unlimited wealth by
    offering different investments.  Depending upon how wisely or not you
    invest your money, you watch it grow or shrink.  Types of investments
    include stocks, bonds, oil, real estate, and even betting.  It also
    tracks your score so you can play against your friends.
    
    But MEGAGOPOLY is more than that.  Every five years of the simulation,
    you get a bar graph to show your progress down the road to wealth.  But
    don't get too complacent -- you might find yourself in the middle of a
    recession, or trying to make out in the world of runaway inflation.
