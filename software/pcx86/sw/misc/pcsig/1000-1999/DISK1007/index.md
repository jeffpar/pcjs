## Information about "C-WINDOW TOOLKIT 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1705)"

    The "c_wndw" and "c_ndx" libraries are designed for both novice and
    intermediate C programmers who want full screen, color, cursor control,
    windowing abilities and relational database facilities without
    programming complex escape sequences or DOS-level interrupts.  They are
    designed for experienced programmers who need a set of fast I/O
    windowing and disk access functions.  A full set of file access
    functions are given that trap and handle all usual errors.
    
    The "c_wndw" library provides input and output windowing abilities that
    operate at professional speeds.  The output windowing facilities use
    memory mapping for instant screen display.  Full advantage is taken of
    color monitors, and automatic editing of entry and output fields id
    provided.  Pull-down and pop-up menu functions, help screens, and
    multi-layered windows provide a sophisticated user interface.
    
    The "c_ndx" library provides multiple B-tree access to data files and
    supports intelligent relational access to multiple data files via hashed
    random file access.  The database file is the familiar dBase standard,
    and the indexes are fully compatible with the dBase NDX format.
    
    With these libraries you can develop superior programs in C in less time
    than in the dBase language.
