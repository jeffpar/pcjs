## Information about "SERVICE PLUS 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1271)"

    Maintenance and repair companies will find SERVICE PLUS a valuable
    system to organize, control and track service calls, and generate
    expense and billing reports. It converts often forgotten verbal
    commitments into focused, daily appointment and callback lists that
    result in extra business.
    
    SERVICE PLUS generates appointment schedules with a tickler file, and
    billing and expense reports that can clock and cost each activity. You
    can create an "industry-specific" help screen with up to 15,000
    characters of text about your industry, accessible anywhere in the
    program with one single keystroke. SERVICE PLUS standardizes your
    maintenance and service call information.
    
    The following business types have found SERVICE PLUS to be a valuable
    system: heating/air conditioning repair, electrical maintenance, auto
    repair, computer/copier rental and repair, any equipment tracking or
    maintenance, plant preventive maintenance, plumbing, bus or taxi
    maintenance, any repair business with a service bay, plus any department
    that provides product service and support.
    
    SERVICE PLUS comes with a tutorial and is extensively documented.
