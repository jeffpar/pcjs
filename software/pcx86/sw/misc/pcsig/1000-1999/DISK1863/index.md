## Information about "MATHPLOT"

    MATHPLOT is a set of graphics-aided programs designed to help
    scientists and engineers analyze data.  Routines are included for
    least-squares fitting polynomials to sets of data points, solving
    simultaneous linear equations, numerically integrating a curve defined
    by a set of data points, calculating simple statistical parameters for
    data sets, and for calculating the coefficients of a Fourier series for
    a periodic function described by a set of data points.
    
    Programs are also included for calculating and plotting Fourier spectra
    and Bessel functions, for plotting data sets and for plotting and
    comparing user-specified functions with data sets.
