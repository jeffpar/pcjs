## Information about "PROBAT"

    Do you spend hours making batch files and wish there were a more
    comprehensive way to construct your own user friendly batch interface.
    Well, PROBAT has revolutionized the way complex batch files are built.
    This sophisticated program gives you the power to create batch files
    with chaining screens, graphic screen layout, keyboard input
    acceptance, and informational prompting.  It is great for the
    programmer or system designer who currently uses a mixed bag of
    tricks to get batch files looking even halfway decent.  With PROBAT you
    will work in one comprehensive batch file creator complete with pull-
    down menus and extensive editing options.  Though PROBAT takes some time
    to learn, the results are the most professional batch files possible.
    
    You can use PROBAT to save batch file formats or screen designs to be
    recalled and edited later.  Create your own library of batch formats to
    be recalled and modified for different purposes.  PROBAT lets you draw
    boxes, set screen colors, and create menus.  There is even a handsome
    graphics menu screen that can be integrated into the batch files you
    create.  If you are serious about batch files, PROBAT is an involved
    and indepth program that will allow you to create the best in batch
    files.
