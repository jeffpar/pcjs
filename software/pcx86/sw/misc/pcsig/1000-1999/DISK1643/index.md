## Information about "KEDITOR (ALSO 1665)"

    Designed to edit source code files, KEDITOR makes the life of
    a programmer easier with its swift assembler language and versatile
    file manipulation capabilities.  Lots of on-line help makes this source
    code editor a good choice regardless of what language you program in.
    KEDITOR offers language features enhancing its use with C, MASM, Turbo
    C, TASM, QuickBASIC, Turbo Pascal, Clipper, dBASE III+, dBASE IV, and
    Lotus 1-2-3.
    
    Additionally, you get ASCII and scan code tables, BIOS addresses, DOS
    interrupts, word cross reference, and Hex conversion.  Over 100 commands
    and subcommands give you the control to sort, show-only, program macros,
    shell to DOS, point and find next, and print a range of lines.  Pick
    your commands in WordStar type, two letter mnemonics, or alias names of
    up to 10 letters.  You even have the ability to cut and paste as you
    browse code.
