## Information about "AUTOMATIC FORTRAN FORMAT STATEMENTS"

    FMT takes the drudgery out of writing FORTRAN FORMAT statements by
    automatically generating FORMAT statements for you.  Simply use a
    wordprocessor or text editor to create an ASCII file that looks just
    like the output you would like your program to produce.  FMT turns your
    data into a set of FORMAT statements that can be pasted into your
    FORTRAN program.  This is a great tool for any FORTRAN programmer.
    
    The input to FMT is an ASCII file containing the output that is to be
    transformed into FORTRAN FORMAT statements.  The file should look just
    the way it is to appear on screen.  FMT automatically adds the leading
    blank character required by FORTRAN.  FMT can be instructed to treat
    each line in the input file as a separate FORMAT statement.
