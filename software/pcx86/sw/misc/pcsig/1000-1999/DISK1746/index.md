## Information about "PIROUETTE"

    Take total control of your database entry screen and report formats
    without doing a lick of programming. This database lets you "paint"
    screens and reports, giving the user maximum control over the
    appearance of input screens and printed output.
    
    Create databases of unlimited size. Data is loaded into memory one
    record at a time, so any file limitations are imposed by your disk
    size, not your system's memory. Files are in standard dBase format so
    they are compatible with other database software.
    
    PIROUETTE even has "relational" power to help you work with
    multiple, interrelated databases simultaneously. In addition, all
    standard search and sort routines are fully implemented.
