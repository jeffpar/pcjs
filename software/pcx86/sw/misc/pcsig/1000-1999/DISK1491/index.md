## Information about "TESSERACT"

    TESSERACT provides both the tools and the instructions for the
    programmer who desires to try his hand at TSR (terminate and stay
    resident) programming.
    
    TESSERACT comes with extensive and in-depth documentation that is
    insightful and gives the first-time TSR programmer a good knowledge
    base.  Included in this excellent package is a library of routines and
    data structures that will aid in developing RAM-resident programs and a
    set of routines that attempt to standardize TSR-to-TSR communication.
    The library is compatible with Microsoft C, Turbo C, Turbo Pascal, and
    assembler languages.
    
    Interrupts and BIOS bugs have made TSR programming an extremely
    difficult and dark area of programming -- TESSERACT makes the task far
    more manageable, both for the expert as well as the brave novice.  The
    manual alone is worth the price!
