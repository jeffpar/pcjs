## Information about "SCHEDULE MAGIC"

    SCHEDULE MAGIC is designed to automatically calculate and optimize daily
    commercial vehicle schedules. The schedule optimizer finds vehicle
    routes that minimize the number of vehicles needed, thus
    reducing total fleet miles. Until now, the formidable mathematics of
    optimization needed mainframe computers for vehicle scheduling.
    However, this program uses a new method that allows the same
    calculations to be made on any IBM-PC or compatible.
    
    Four sample scheduling applications are included as tutorial example
    problems:
    
    ~ Service: plumbing, heating and air conditioning, appliance
    installation and repair, pest control, etc.
    
    ~ Delivery: wholesale delivery of groceries, drugs, hardware, fuel oil,
    commodities, etc.
    
    ~ Schools: bus routings
    
    ~ Banks: courier vehicles for branch bank pick-up operations
    
    SCHEDULE MAGIC offers a whole new approach and system design based on
    the concepts of grid coordinate locations of all points, automatically-
    calculated straight line distances and travel times, and getting started
    by use of a complete manually-calculated schedule.
