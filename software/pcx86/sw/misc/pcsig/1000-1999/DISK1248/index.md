## Information about "PRODEX PLUS"

    If your telephone is your livelihood, PRODEX-PLUS may ring your bell by
    combining a telephone directory, report log, and things-to-do scheduler
    to make you more productive.
    
    Names and phone numbers of your personal and business contacts become a
    snap to keep track of and change as needed using the automatic telephone
    directory function.  Auto dial is also included.
    
    The report log allows you to record the date and time of calls, and make
    ``folders'' which act as electronic notepads and mini data files for
    keeping track of important information and follow-up on your phone
    conversations.
    
    The things-to-do scheduler lets you set appointments, planned activities
    and ticklers to remind you of dangling commitments.
    
    With PRODEX-PLUS, you can selectively sort and print mailing labels,
    address lists, phone directory lists, to-do lists, and folders.  The
    program is memory-resident and so stays out of your way until needed,
    and is menu-driven for ease of use.
