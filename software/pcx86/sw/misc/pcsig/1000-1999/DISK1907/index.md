## Information about "CALENDAR MATE"

    CALENDAR MATE can print a monthly calendar with your scheduled events.
    The strength of this program is its ability to interpret repeating
    events.  Repeating cycles such as yearly, weekly, fortnightly are easily
    handled.  More complicated cycles such as "3rd Sunday of the month,"
    "2nd workday in September" can also be scheduled.
    
    Flexible date formats allow users to enter dates in a variety of
    comfortable formats.  There is context-sensitive help available from
    anywhere in the program and a help panel will be displayed.
    
    The program can be customized by the user.  All the window colors can
    be changed and saved.  There are a number of system parameters that can
    be changed by the user.  Things like whether or not to include the
    Julian date on a printed calendar, whether or not to automatically
    delete expired events, how often to save the data file, and many others
    are available to be tailored by the user.
