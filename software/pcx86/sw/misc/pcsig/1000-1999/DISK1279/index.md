## Information about "THE NAVIGATOR, DISKDUPE, AND VIRUSCHK"

    Steer your way around your hard disk with a sailor's ease.  No need to
    keep your sextant at hand -- NAVIGATOR knows how to direct you there.
    With this hard disk menu program, you'll get around without having to
    remember DOS commands.
    
    You can access programs and directories with point-and-shoot menus. The
    program lists up to 200 directories, programs, and files when you boot
    up.  Twenty-three files are displayed at a time.  To access a
    directory, or run a program, point an arrow at it and press Enter.  A
    handy command lets you instantly move to the root directory.  You can
    quickly display or erase files and empty directories.
    
    Ahoy, matey! Is that a .BAT file just above the horizon?
    
    DISKDUPE was made for folks who need to duplicate lots of programs or
    disks in various formats.
    
    It's versatile!  It copies 5.25" disks whether they are standard 360K,
    AT high-density 1.2MB disks, or even CPM/86 with eight sectors. It can
    also handle 720K and 1.4MB 3.5" disks.
    
    It's fast!  It duplicates 360K disks in less than 58 seconds.  Using
    pre-formatted disks, the time drops to less than 26 seconds.  DISKDUPE
    uses your hard disk as a buffer so you can copy high-density disks
    exceeding your RAM memory without slowing down.
    
    You can quickly format disks ahead of time, copy image files from a
    diskette onto your hard disk, and specify a list of hard disk image
    files to create or copy from.  It runs manually or with special
    auto-loader hardware available from the author.
    
    VIRUSCHK, a computer virus alarm, helps protect your system from viruses
    that can lay dormant and suddenly destroy all your files.  Days,
    weeks, or months of effort can be lost.  It detects any change to your
    files and reports this to you before the virus can do its damage.
    
    VIRUSCHK reads each file and performs a summing and encryption algorithm
    on each byte in the file.  A special data file is created containing
    this information and is used to recheck all files upon command for any
    changes.
