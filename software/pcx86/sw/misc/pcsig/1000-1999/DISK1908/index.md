    YOU ARE THE RULER.......

    Your  courage,  strength,  and wisdom are legendary. You have outwitted
    and outmaneuvered every enemy. Your Castle is secure. Your subjects are
    loyal.  Your  land  is  at  peace.  Beautiful  music  echoes  over  the
    countryside.

    Just  as  you  are  seated  before a roaring fire in the Great Hall and
    about to bite into a hot cheesy pizza, your most trusted knight  rushes
    in.   Breathlessly  he informs you of alien spacecraft heading directly
    toward your Castle.

    You rush to the armory.  You find nothing  powerful  enough  to  defeat
    this  awesome  enemy.  Even the latest in weapon technology, your newly
    developed and highly sophisticated Energy Shield cannot  fully  protect
    the  Castle.  There is only one weapon left.  YOU must save the Castle.
    You suit up in your armour of SPEED & ACCURACY and

                                                .........PREPARE FOR BATTLE

                                     PAGE 4

                                    THE STORY


    Story screen will appear automatically. You will want to read this  the
    first  time you play. Next time you may PRESS ANY KEY to go directly to
    the SELECT screen.  You can turn off the sound by pressing [S].


                                 SELECT THE GAME

    1) Select Level

            - Choose a level 1-12.
            - Enter level number on your numberpad.

                   [-]  for subtraction
                   [x]  for multiplication
                   [/]  for division
                   [*]  for all of above

    3) Select Mode

            - Use  the  [UP]  or  [DOWN]  arrow  key  to choose  Regular or

    HINT-----When  you  begin  the game, the [NUMLOCK] key is automatically
    activated.  It is easy to press by accident. If numbers you  press  are
    not  entered  on the screen, try pressing [NUMLOCK]. Otherwise you will
    not need to touch it.

                                   THE BATTLE


    The micro-dots around the Castle make up your Energy Shield and will be
    your  first  line  of defense against alien invaders.  But do not think
    the battle will be won so easily.  You must work hard to maintain  your
    Energy Shield for without it your Castle cannot stand.

    Every time an enemy weapon hits the Energy Shield, it loses  power  and
    becomes  a  little  weaker.  So  you  must try your best to destroy the
    invader ships quickly.

    Math problems will soon appear  in  the  Castle.  As  you  answer  them
    correctly, a Super Energy Beam is fired, blasting the enemy ship out of
    the  sky,  adding  points to your score, and absorbing energy back into
    your Energy Shield.

    The battle is about to begin.  GOOD LUCK!

    To EDIT or CREATE your own problems.

    Now  you  are  ready  to input your own math problems.  You have enough
    room to enter 76 problems in each set.

    1) Enter math problems of your choice.  You  only  need  to  enter  the
       problem.

       Press [ENTER]. Math Castle will calculate the answer for you.

       - Problems can contain as many as 5 digits in the problem. The
         answers can go as high as 9999.

          100 / 10          100 / 9            (remainder)

       - Remember  not  to  enter  division  problems  which  will leave  a
         remainder in the answer.

    2) If you make a mistake and press the wrong number, use [SPACEBAR] and
       [BACKSPACE]  as  your  erasers.  You  can also type over a number to
       change it.

    3) When you have entered a problem, the highlighted bar  moves  to  the
       next position, ready for you to enter another problem.

    4) To  change  or  edit  a  problem,  move highlighted bar to the  math
       problem you want to change or edit.

        - Use [UP] and [DOWN] arrow keys to move within columns.

        - Press [CTRL] + [LEFT] arrow to move highlighted bar one column to
          the left.

        - Press [CTRL] + [RIGHT] arrow to move highlighted bar  one  column
          to the right.

Math problems covering addition, subtraction, multiplication, and

is solved an alien spacecraft is destroyed.  Missed problems are        
reviewed after the game in the ``weapons training'' portion of the game.
Good graphics and lots of sound make this program fun and educational.
