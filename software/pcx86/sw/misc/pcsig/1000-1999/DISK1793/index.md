## Information about "MARK'S CHECKBOOK PLUS"

    Designed for people who save a number of transactions before entering
    them into their checkbook, this complete checkbook manager will perform
    complex tasks that you thought you needed an accounting program to
    handle. It is well suited for those who use the automatic teller
    machines (ATMs) frequently and/or use the carbon copy type checkbooks.
    Also perfect for those with a number of credit cards or accounts that
    require a regular payment.
    
    MARK'S CHECKBOOK PLUS handles two types of accounts: assets and
    liabilities. You can track an unlimited number of accounts and
    transactions. The program allows the transfer of funds between
    accounts and keeps track of all outstanding credits and debits. It is
    very easy to reconcile, and print monthly reports or all transactions
    reports. You have control over all your accounts with browse and sort
    functions, which makes it easy to see where your money is going.
