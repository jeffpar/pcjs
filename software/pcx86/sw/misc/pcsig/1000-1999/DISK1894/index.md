## Information about "GARDEN PRODUCTIVITY CALCULATOR"

    Grow-your-own, and be profitable.  GARDEN PRODUCTIVITY CALCULATOR helps
    you track the expenses and productivity of your home or small commercial
    garden, and analyzes its financial profitability.
    
    This program works on the assumption that the cash value of the crop you
    produce should equal the total expenses of your garden to break even.
    Expenses are labor, seed, water, mulching materials, etc.  GARDEN
    PRODUCTIVITY CALCULATOR calculates relative to the break even point,
    where your expenses match the value of your crops at the market.  The
    statistics provided about your garden and needs for production are very
    thorough and informative.
    
    Even if profit isn't the reason for your garden, you should still know
    which crops save you money and which ones cost you.  Computing this
    information will help you choose the best crops for next year.
