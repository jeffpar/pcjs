## Information about "FLASHBOX"

    FLASHBOX is part of the Brandon's Lunchbox series of educational
    programs for children, ages 3-7. FLASHBOX is a set of reading and
    memory drills. Each module contains 20 recommended "sight" words for
    pre-primer through first grade. These drills can be monitored or
    played alone.
    
    Four boxes (numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4) flash on the screen. Each box
    covers a word. One at a time, a box vanishes for two seconds,
    revealing the word underneath. The player then receives a word on the
    bottom of the screen. This word matches one of the words behind the
    boxes. The player must guess which box hides the matching word.
    
    When all four boxes disappear, the drill "trills" and colors flash on
    the screen. The four boxes reappear, with four new words -- one behind
    each box. Once the fifth screen of words is matched, the drill breaks
    away to a Mardi Gras parade!
    
    The timing loops in the programs are based for the standard 4.7 Mhz PC
    processor. If you're using a faster machine, you may wish to place
    your machine in "slow" mode or use a slowing program such as PC-SIG disk
