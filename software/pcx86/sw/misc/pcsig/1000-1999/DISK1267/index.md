## Information about "PC-WRITE FONT SELECTOR/PAGEMAKER IMPORT"

    FONT SELECTOR was written for PC-Write users with Hewlett Packard
    LaserJets and compatible printers.  It enables them to select, with
    print controls within their text, the fonts built into the HP, the HP
    cartridge, and hundreds of commercially available soft fonts!  It's a
    poor man's desktop publishing.
    
    This program is a boon to graphic artists whose customers request a wide
    variety of type faces and sizes for their documents.  Firms which
    generate their own documents will find their ability to create
    custom-looking documents is greatly enhanced.
    
    FONT SELECTOR works by creating special print control files for each
    font you use.  It also creates a download batch file that copies the
    soft fonts into the printer's memory.  Simple control characters within
    PC-Write are then used to tag text.
