## Information about "QIP  2 OF 4 (ALSO 1477, 1479, 1480)"

    QIP is first and foremost a wordprocessor.  If you are accustomed to
    using wordprocessors and text editors, you will find all the commands
    found in a good wordprocessor, such as marking and copying blocks,
    search and replace, etc.  A few more pleasant surprises lie in wait for
    you in the form of features such as effects. Effects gives you easy and
    flexible control of both display colors and printout fonts.
    
    QIP is also a table processor.  Create tables, graphs or lists, large
    and small, anywhere in your document.  These tables, graphs, or lists
    are managed along with your text to help you produce attractive reports,
    or to create large databases.  More than that, QIP provides many
    powerful table processing functions, ranging from the simple extract and
    sort commands, to the enormously versatile update and calculation
    commands.
    
    When you first start to use QIP, you'll probably view it as a
    wordprocessor, and experiment with its on-screen formatting, line
    drawing, color-processing, on-line help system, and printer control
    capabilities. As you start to work with tables, adding simple lists or
    charts to your reports, you'll see how all your data can be smoothly
    collated and updated.  Before very long, you'll be using the more
    powerful table processing features to generate sales summaries,
    prepare work schedules, create form letters, or update stock lists.
    Ultimately, QIP may become your best tool for the most critical task
    of all -- turning volumes of raw data into that essential element of
    modern life -- useful information.
