## Information about "PC-AGENT"

    PC AGENT is one of those rare, focused programs that performs with speed
    and elegance.  This no-nonsense program helps sell real estate by
    serving as a prospect card filing system for realtors.
    
    Everything important about the prospects and their desires is in the
    file.  Single family residence, townhouse or condo?  What price range?
    Location?  Do they want a garage?  When a home pops up on the market, it
    quickly calls up everyone on the list who wants a property like that and
    has the money, or credit line, to afford it.
    
    Sixteen fields for data cover: name, address, phone numbers, price
    range, income, cash down, number of bedrooms, style, garage, land, area
    desired, and comments.  A user guide is available, but the screen
    prompts are so self-explanatory you'll be in business in minutes.
