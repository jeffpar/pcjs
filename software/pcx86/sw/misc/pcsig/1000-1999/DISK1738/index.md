## Information about "POWER DESK"

    Gentlemen, and Ladies, start your engines -- because now you've got
    POWER DESK. This is the desk utility that turns a computer klutz into
    a power user and lets almost anyone else sail through the daily grind
    with confidence.
    
    Do you need a great address filer with mail merge? POWER DESK's got
    it. Would you like a word processor with a spell-checker, letterhead
    and envelope printer, label maker, calendar, scheduler, reminder,
    automatic phone log, expense log, and file handling capabilities that
    rival many hard disk utilities? That's POWER DESK, too.
    
    Not only does POWER DESK rev up and run, it handles like a much more
    expensive model. Drop-down menus give you well-ordered options, and
    every situation is covered by clear instructions available through the
    F1 help button. Back out of any situation with the Escape key.
    
    Whether you use POWER DESK as a complete desk organizer, for personal
    time management, or just take advantage of its excellent address/mail
    merge abilities, POWER DESK is going to take you as far as you want to
    go.
