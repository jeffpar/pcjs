## Information about "STUPENDOS"

    STUPENDOS is a powerful disk management utility that goes beyond just
    displaying and manipulating files in a user friendly manner. In
    addition to sorted file lists, tree directory display, file tagging,
    disk and memory information, STUPENDOS has a mouse interface, a
    file-find function, a file-display filter, and a file-move utility to
    move files from one directory to another.
    
    But the more subtle features are what sets STUPENDOS apart from other
    disk managers. When a batch copy of files stops because of lack of
    disk space, STUPENDOS can continue and copy smaller files in the batch
    list that might fit. STUPENDOS has a "view contents" function that
    can be customized to call any program (DISP, SHOW, a favorite editor,
    etc.) in place of the TYPE function to view the file.
