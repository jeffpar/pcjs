## Information about "SOFTWARE MANAGER"

    Here is a menu program that gives you real freedom over what your menu
    can look like.  Its unique "paint" feature lets you determine how large
    different menu choices will be, which choices will blink, and what
    color each part of your menu will be.  Besides a flexible appearance,
    you'll find the features you would want in any good menu program
    including password protection, multiple menu access, and an easy menu
    building facility.
    
    Another advantage to SOFTWARE MANAGER is that it doesn't require you to
    create elaborate batch files to get your programs to run.  It simply
    asks you where your program files are and what command needs to be
    issued to start the program.  It does the rest automatically.  Take the
    first step to making your PC easier to use.
