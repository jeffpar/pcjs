## Information about "CLASSIC SOLUTIONS 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1138)"

    CLASSIC SOLUTIONS is both a language and a database manager -- a
    system that creates fast, powerful business programs -- today.
    
    CLASSIC SOLUTIONS provides a quick way to create screens and reports as
    they will appear on a terminal or printed page.  It is also a data
    control system to keep track of all of the items of information --what
    they are, what they contain, what is valid data, and how each item
    relates to all the others; a data dictionary.  Also included is a set of
    standardized tools so you don't have to rebuild the same logic over and
    over.  Use the same data entry techniques for each and every
    application.
    
    The number of data files supported by CLASSIC SOLUTIONS are limited
    only by the amount of available storage.  Each data file can have 250
    records and each record can have 1,000 fields.  CLASSIC SOLUTIONS comes
    with an on-line tutorial to help you get started.  It is fully menu-
    driven and extensively documented.
