## Information about "PHOEBE"

    PHOEBE is designed to help you manage contacts effectively.  In making a
    sale, you need to match the strategy to the prospect and supply the
    goods the moment the opportunity arises.
    
    Prospecting is important to bring in new business, but without a system
    to manage these and prior contacts, prospects are useless.  PHOEBE is an
    extremely powerful system designed to help you as a client management
    tool.  Because of the amount of flexibility built into this system, it
    can help anyone with several contacts to manage.
    
    Track clients by company name, date of last appointment, date of next
    appointment, year-to-date sales, salesperson, geographic area, and by
    eight user-definable fields called "relationship fields."  Use these
    relationship fields to custom tailor PHOEBE to your own needs.
    
    There is a comments section which you can use for important information
    about the last conversation, the next meeting, or anything else that
    will help you in dealing with that particular client.
    
    The real power of any database is the information provided from it in
    the form of reports, and PHOEBE provides you with many options.  PHOEBE
    can furnish reports with over 1,000 select and sort pattern
    combinations.  Report capability includes tracking of calls, printing
    prospect lists, advertising sources where leads are generated, and more.
