## Information about "MODULA-2 COMPILER 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1080)"

    The MODULA-2 COMPILER (M2C) proves you don't have to buy a
    commercial package to get a full-featured compiler!  M2C features the
    compiler combined with an integrated editor and ``make'' facility, a
    program linker, an execution profiler, and a makefile generator.
    
    Code generated by the M2C suits either the Intel 8086 ``huge'' or
    ``large'' memory models.  More restrictive memory models are not
    supported.  For the ``huge'' model, each module has its own data and
    code segment.  Each of the segments can be up to 64K in size.  For the
    ``large'' memory model, static data from all the modules is combined
    into a single data segment.  For either model, pointers are four bytes
    long and all remaining memory is available for the ``heap''.
    
    The package includes 37 pages of well-written and indexed
    documentation.
