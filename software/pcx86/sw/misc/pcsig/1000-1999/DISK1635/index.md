## Information about "TASK MASTER"

    Looking for a slick alternative to XTree or your current DOS shell?
    TASK MASTER is an integrated set of utilities for disk, directory, and
    file management that gives you powers far beyond those of DOS alone.
    
    More than a simple DOS shell, TASK MASTER allows you to log up to 26
    disk drives, then graphically display your tree of subdirectories for
    any disk drive. It also provides for multiple file functions
    including attributes and date/time changes, file security, and backup
    onto multiple diskettes. You can recall 20 stored DOS or TASK
    MASTER commands. The fully indexed user's manual will guide you
    through the power of this program.
    
    Perhaps the greatest strength of TASK MASTER is its ability to work
    with whole directories in ways DOS never dreamed of. Copy, move, or
    delete a directory or multiple directories with a single step -- as
    easy as working with individual files.
