## Information about "BACKMAIL"

    Turn your computer into the center of your own electronic mail
    network with BACKMAIL, a background communications program that will
    not interrupt your work or your incoming voice calls.
    
    BACKMAIL can be used to compose and send messages, files and programs
    with other BACKMAIL users over regular phone lines using a standard
    modem while you are using your computer as you ordinarily would.
    
    Operating in the background, BACKMAIL will call phone numbers to which
    you have addressed messages or files, deliver them at a preassigned
    time, collect any mail addressed to you from there, terminate the call
    and repeat this process for the next appropriate destination on your
    list.  All of this without bothering you, and without interrupting the
    normal use of your machine.
    
    BACKMAIL doesn't interfere with the normal use of your phone for voice
    messages. Turn down the bell on your phone and carry on with your
    work. BACKMAIL will use your modem to answer all calls. If it's a
    voice call, the program will ring the speaker on your computer and ask
    you to pick up the phone. If it's another BACKMAIL calling, the
    program will receive your mail, store it to disk, and send any pending
    mail that you have addressed to the person who called you.
