## Information about "PRO SET FOOTBALL"

    4th Quarter, two minutes left to play.  Ball is on the 20 yard line, 4th
    down and 1 yard to go -- as coach of your favorite football team it is
    up to you to decide the next strategy in Ed Hagen's PRO SET FOOTBALL.
    Choose from your favorite teams as you decide the offensive and
    defensive choices for your players.  Pass, run, kick, score touchdowns
    and kick field goals.  Get penalized for "off sides" or intercept a pass
    and run it back for 6 points!
    
    Although PRO SET FOOTBALL is not a graphic game, its depth is made up in
    the format in which you play.  First, either choose from pro or college
    teams.  Second, play against the computer or a friend.  Select from a
    menu of options for either the defensive or offensive plays -- the
    computer then "plays" the results of your choices.  Game time is held in
    15 minute quarters and stats of all your players (real players from the
    1987 pro teams and 1988 college teams) are displayed at half time and
    the end.  Sound effects are minimal but do add a nice quality to the
    game.
    
    Truly enjoyable, simple to use, PRO SET FOOTBALL will never be the same
    game twice.  Enjoy playing the pros all year round -- a nice addition to
    your computerized sports library.
