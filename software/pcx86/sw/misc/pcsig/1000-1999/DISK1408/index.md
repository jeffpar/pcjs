## Information about "CLONEROM"

    Watch out, Big Blue!  CLONEROM helps the dedicated hobbyist make his
    PC/XT/AT absolutely, totally IBM compatible, right down to the
    programming of the chips in the motherboard.  To obtain system-level
    compatibililty, you must install a true blue ROM-BIOS.  The full text
    from the IBM-PC Read-Only-Memory Backup Manual is ready to print to
    tell you how.  Two utility programs are available to help you finish the
    job.
    
    If you already own an IBM or clone, how would you like to have backup
    ROM and EPROM chips that cost less than IBM-programmed ICs?  You can do
    it with CLONEROM.  Save your entire ROM on disks as insurance against
    disaster.
