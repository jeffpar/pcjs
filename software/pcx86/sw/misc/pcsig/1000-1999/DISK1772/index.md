## Information about "UNIVERSE ANALYZER"

    What is the probability of an undesigned universe meeting all the
    requirements for a biologically favorable universe? UNIVERSE ANALYZER
    is designed to provide a limited answer to this important question. By
    "a biologically favorable universe," this program means a universe with
    plenty of heavy elements such as carbon, and a large number of bright
    long-lived stars like the sun.
    
    After prompting the user for inputs, the program generates a list of
    seven requirements for a biologically favorable universe. Using a
    random number generator, the program then generates many "universe
    models" with various characteristics as a result of chance. The program
    does NOT involve any religious or philosophical presuppositions.
    However, the program does tend to reach the philosophically interesting
    conclusion that there is less than one chance in 1,000,000,000,000,000
    that an undesigned universe would be biologically favorable.
