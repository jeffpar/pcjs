## Information about "MAILING LIST MANAGEMENT DISK 2OF2 (1702)"

    Does your business need to track customer contacts and print mailing
    labels for customer information?  The MAILING LIST MANAGEMENT DATABASE
    can do both jobs for you.
    
    The MAILING LIST MANAGEMENT DATABASE uses a single entry screen and a
    series of pop-up windows, selected by function keys.  These pop-up
    windows allow you to see the main entry screen as you select a
    particular function.  You'll never lose sight of your data.
    
    The database can maintain an unlimited number of files with up to 1,000
    records per datafile.  A fast search function will search through the
    selected data file for a particular record number, name, company,
    state,
    category, and/or ID number.  A file backup feature is included to
    safeguard against data corruption.  A file export function will allow
    the data to be sent to a file that can be imported to dBASE III+, LOTUS
    1-2-3, or any word processing system with an ASCII import feature.

                                HOW TO INSTALL

    The  main  file  on  this  diskette  is  called  DBASE.EXE and is an
    archived file. An archived file is a composite  of  several  files  and
    each  file  must  be  extracted  before  the  dBASE 3+ conversion
    routine can be operated.

    In  order  to  extract  the  program files, simply follow the following
    instructions :

          1    -     COPY  DBASE.EXE  TO  THE  DISK  THAT  YOU  WILL  BE
                     OPERATING FROM.  PREFERRABLY A HARD DRIVE.

          2    -     AT THE DOS PROMPT, TYPE THE WORD DBASE

          3     -    YOU  WILL  SEE A SERIES OF TEXT LINES APPEAR ON YOUR
                     SCREEN, THESE ARE THE FILES BEING EXTRACTED FROM THE
                     ARCHIVED FILE.

          4    -     ONCE THE EXTRACTION PROCEDURE IS COMPLETE, YOU WILL BE
                     RETURNED TO THE DOS PROMPT.

          5    -     AT THIS POINT, TYPE THE WORD VIEWCUST TO  READ  AND/OR
                     PRINT THE DOCUMENTATION.

          6    -     EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE FOR DBASE 3+ USE.  IF
                     YOU ARE A DBASE USER, THESE FILES WILL BE QUITE HANDY.
