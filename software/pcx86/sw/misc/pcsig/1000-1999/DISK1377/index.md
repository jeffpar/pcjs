## Information about "SPEECH"

    SPEECH can make your computer talk -- in a robotic tone of voice, of
    course, and you can have it say anything you want!
    
    The memory-resident program can be added via a batch file to any of your
    programs so they will give a talking introduction.  It reads from any
    standard text file but the words need to be written phonetically.
    Several phonetic texts are included to give you an idea of how to write
    your own, and to get your computer talking right off.
    
    Sixteen speeds are provided so you can use it on nearly any computer no
    matter what its processor speed, such as 8, 10 or even 33 megahertz.  To
    start you just pick one of the versions of SPEECH#.COM you think is
    close to your machine's speed, load it and type READ (demo file of your
    choice).  Unfortunately, you do have to reboot each time to try a
    different speed.
    
    Depending on your computer's speaker, the results can be amazing or
    really bad.  Getting your IBM-PC to talk, without adding additional
    hardware is kind of like dancing dogs.  It's not that they do it very
    well that amazes us...it's that they can do it at all!
