THE ELECTRICAL REFERENCE DATABASE gives electricians, engineers,        
designers, and panel shop operators one place on your computer where you
can go to and find those little notes that only experience produces.  In
this case an experienced professional has given you his experience and  
created a forum for you to add your own.

Motor databases provide information as to full load currents, motor over
current protection rating, the size or guage of the wire required to    
connect one motor of that particular horsepower in a general purpose    
application, the conduit trade size required to house the wire, the NEMA
size starter recommended,the amperage and the recommended fusing.       
                                                                        
The present data is referred to as "seed" data just to get you started. 
You may add and delete data as you like.  Each data base may can handle 
a maximum of 32000 entries.                                             
                                                                        
Each database is menu-driven and complete with it's own help function   
and notes field.  Use this data base as a tool - not as a replacement   
for the NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE manual!  All information assumes a     
single motor installation.  Consult your N.E.C. manual for the details  
of your particular installation.
