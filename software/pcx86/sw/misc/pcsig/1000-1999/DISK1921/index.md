## Information about "ZIPP APPEAL DISK 1 OF 3"

    ZIPP APPEAL is a companion product to Mass Appeal mailing manager,
    PC-SIG disk #1920.  Essentially, ZIPP APPEAL is a large data file that
    links cities to zip codes and zip codes to cities.  While working in
    Mass Appeal, if you enter the zip code ZIPP APPEAL will find the city
    and state and automatically insert them into the data entry screen.
    
    With ZIPP APPEAL installed, you can also enter the name, or partial name
    of a city, and browse through a list of possible zip codes and states
    for the entry.  You are allowed to page forwards, backwards, and even
    find another city if you like.
    
    When ZIPP APPEAL is on your hard disk, Mass Appeal automatically senses
    the presence of the zip code data file, and inserts the city and state
    for over 95,000 U.S. zip codes (Also available in a smaller, 40,000
    version)!
