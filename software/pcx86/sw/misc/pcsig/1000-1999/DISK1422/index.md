## Information about "GARDEN CITY SOFTWARE COLLECTION #2"

    An even half-dozen programs that run the scale from mortgages to
    metronomes.
    
    HYPNO brings onto screen colorful hypnotic images to induce relaxation
    or enhance meditation. Provides changing circles, spirals a swinging
    watch, etc. Of particular note is a visual that is combined with
    affirmations (positive statements) to help you change negative mental
    images or bad habits.
    
    MORTGAGE is a neat package that will compute your proposed mortgage
    payments and homeowner's costs by considering things such as insurance,
    taxes and maintenance dues.
    
    TIMEZONE tells you what time it is anywhere in the world, listing by
    country, area of country and cities. Useful when communicating with
    faraway places.
    
    The next three are for musicians. PC-SOUND achieves the unbelievable:
    your computer can sound like a tuba, saxophone, fife or other
    instruments. Or, if you prefer, you get white or pink noise or the
    sound of a siren or ray gun or clock ticking or waves beating on the
    shore, and lots more. Depending on your PC's speaker, the effects range
    from entrancing to distracting.
    
    How would you like to tune a guitar, violin, banjo, mandolin and other
    musical instruments with the help of your computer? Or, produce
    mathematically precise tones. Use TUNER.
    
    METRON is an electronic metronome for musicians to set the beat.
