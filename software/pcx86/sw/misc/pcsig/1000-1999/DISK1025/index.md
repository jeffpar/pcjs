## Information about "PDS*BASE 2 OF 2 (ALSO 396)"

    A complete hierarchical database system of the master/detail (or
    mother/daughter) type and, although written for BASIC programmers, is
    particularly well-suited to inventory systems, payroll or job control
    systems.
    
    A series of program generators create both a custom database (with up
    to 10 files) and BASIC programs to operate against the custom
    database. The generated programs can be easily modified. The system
    has excellent documentation and BASIC source code is included.
    
    This is the database management system for anyone who doesn't want to
    go to the expense and trouble of learning a new programming language.

   Version  4.04     PDS*BASE DATA BASE SYSTEM REGISTRATION FORM      03/10/90

   Thank  you  for evaluating my Shareware Software.  If you find that you are
   able  to  use  this software beyond the evaluation stage, you MUST register
   your  copy  with PRO DEV Software.  The Registration Fee is only $40.00 FOR
   EACH  COPY  IN  USE.    The  next  page  is the order form.  To insure your
   satisfaction, I offer the following.



                            Pre-Registration Support

       You  can  call  (preferred)  or  write  to  PRO  DEV  Software with any
       necessary   questions  about  setting  up  or  effectively  using  this
       Shareware  IF  you  encounter  problems.  This system is used mostly by
       those  that  already  program in the BASIC language.  Please be sure to
       follow the Setup instructions in the README.DOC file . . .

            COPY A:README.DOC PRN  (Enter)

       .  .  .  before  calling  or  writing.    If  I determine that you have
       received  a  faulty  evaluation  copy,  I  will  probably  send  you  a
       complimentary  evaluation  copy.   PRO DEV Software's hours are 8:00 to
       5:00 Monday to Friday Eastern Time USA.




                 Here is what you will get for your registering.

   1.  You  will  receive  a  registered  copy  of  the  latest version of the
       PDS*BASE  Data  Base system Shareware disk.  You will NOT have to enter
       the  copyright screen random number.  You will also be able to skip the
       closing  screen.    You  will  NOT  be  sent  a  printed  copy  of  the
       documentation  as  the  on-disk  manual  is  complete and describes all
       features.   This also holds down the registration cost of this powerful
       system.


   2.  You  will  receive  at least 1 year of telephone (preferred) or written
       support.    For  registrants  outside  the USA or Canada, I will not be
       able  to  return  telephone  calls  as  the  overseas rates can rapidly
       exceed the low registration cost.


   3.  If  you  discover  what  appears  to  be  a  bug, PRO DEV Software will
       attempt  to  resolve  the bug within 30 days from the time that PRO DEV
       Software   receives   your   full  telephoned  (preferred)  or  written
       description  of the bug.  If the cause of the perceived bug is a result
       of  unusual  hardware  or software that you are using, PRO DEV Software
       can  not  always  modify  the  programs  to  operate  with your unusual
       arrangements.

   Version  4.04     PDS*BASE DATA BASE SYSTEM REGISTRATION FORM      03/10/90

   signature.    If you are outside the USA or Canada obtain a check from your
   bank  in  USA  funds  on  a  USA  bank.  You may find it easiest to send an
   American  Express  Check or even USA cash.  Canadian registrants can submit
   their  check  using  Canadian  funds WITHOUT exchange rate adjustments.  If
   Canadians  use a Credit Card the Credit Card Company WILL apply the current
   exchange  rate.   Registrants outside the USA or Canada should add an extra
   $5.00 USA equivalent to cover extra banking and/or postage costs.

  Copyright  1989 by PRO DEV Software                    PDS*BASE Version 4.04

                                 March 10, 1990

  To Disk Copying OR Bulletin Board Service Librarian OR SYSOP:

                             You are authorized . . .

  This  file  authorizes  you to include the (2) disk PDS*BASE Data Base system
  Version  4.04  Shareware  software  in  your  Shareware  Cataloging  and Disk
  Copying  Service  or  BBS.  This  is a non-exclusive authorization.  Further,
  this  file  notifies  you  that  you may NOT continue distribute or allow BBS
  access  to any PDS*BASE software with any version lower than Version 4.04 and
  file date stamps of 03-10-90.

                           I request that you NOT . . .

  You  may not further compress the software on these disks, particularly so as
  to  add  competing  Shareware or Public Domain software to the disks.  If you
  operate  an  Electronic  Bulletin Board service, you MAY compress this entire
  system  for  use  on  the  BBS  as  long  as  you  do  NOT first unSCRNCH the
  MANUAL.EXE,  UTILDOC.EXE  and  PRIMER.EXE  files.   Please note that previous
  issues   of   the   PDS*BASE  disks  included  the  PKWARE  software  on  the
  distribution  disk  and  the  instruction  manual  was  compressed  from many
  individual files.  This release (with all files dated 03-10-90) will unSCRNCH
  the  MANUAL.EXE  file  into  just  one (1) PDSBASE.DOC file.  The PDSBASE.EXE
  program  (also  dated  03-10-90)  is  rewritten to print from one PDSBASE.DOC
  file  rather than the prior many files.  Thus, BE SURE to place BOTH of these
  disks  into  your  library  or  I  will get nasty calls and letters from your
  customers.

                                   You may . . .

  Disk  Copying  Services  are encouraged to add your own files to the disks. I
  think that I have allowed sufficient space to do that.

  Now  that  I  have gotten all of that legal stuff out of the way, let me tell
  you  about the PDS*BASE Data Base system.   For three very important reasons,
  the  PDS*BASE  Data Base system is probably the most unusual data base system
  in the Shareware market place.

  FIRST    This  is  a  multi-file automatic relational data base system.  This
           random  access hierarchal type of file arrangement is often referred
           to  as a Master/Detail or Mother/Daughter relational data base.  You
           can also have stand-alone random accessed files.

  SECOND   The  PDS*BASE  Data Base system generates (or writes) BASIC language
           programs  to  operate  the  data base.  Thus, after the user defines
           the  data files and their relations, stand-alone BASIC programs take
           over  from  there.    This  allows  anyone  conversant  in the BASIC
           language  to  "tweek"  the  generated  programs to obtain incredible
           power over their data.

  THIRD    Since  the  system  generates  BASIC  language  programs,  a 66 page
           on-disk  BASIC  Language  Primer  is  included for those that always
           wanted  to learn BASIC, but couldn't find a book written in "people"
           language.  Now they have one.

  Copyright  1989 by PRO DEV Software                   PDS*BASE Version 4.04

                                March 10 - Page 2

  This  release  adds  a  second utility program to create Mail Label programs
  and  programs  to  export and import data from other systems.  The Shareware
  disks have complete documentation and fully functional programs.

  Following  are  one  liner  and  complete  descriptions  to  include in your
  catalog:

  1. One Liner Description

     (disk  number)  PDS*BASE  Multi-File  Data  Base  system  perfect for the
     BASIC programmer (2 disks) [ASP]


  2. Complete Description

     PDS*BASE  Data  Base  system  (2 disks) [ASP].  This is a multi-file data
     base  system  for  those that want nothing hidden.  The system allows you
     to  define  your  single  or  multi-file  random access data base and the
     system  then  generates  BASIC  language  programs  to  operate your data
     base.   The program definer/generator has pull-down menus, pop-up F1 Help
     Screens,  full  on-screen  editing  and  much  more.    The  system  will
     generate  a  variety  of  report  programs  that  can  automatically pull
     together  data  from  one  or many data base files as required. Since the
     system  gives  you  customized  BASIC  language  programs, you can modify
     those   programs   to   add   additional   features   as  desired.    The
     documentation  disk  includes  a complete 144 page instruction manual and
     a  66  page  on-disk  "BASIC Primer" book for those that always wanted to
     learn BASIC, but couldn't find an easy-to-read manual.

     Although  designed  with  the  BASIC  programmer in mind, this system can
     also  easily be used by non-programmers.  The step-by-step examples  show
     you  how  to  create,  run  and  report  on  your  custom data base files
     without  even  looking  at  the  BASIC  language programs.  Included is a
     flexible  menu program for automatically running the BASIC programs.  The
     system requires DOS 2.0 or higher with either BASICA or GWBASIC.

  Thank you very much for carrying my Shareware software.  If you have any
  questions, please write or call 616-788-2243 or CompuServe 72617,1266.

                                         _______
