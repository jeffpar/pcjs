## Information about "BURN-IN"

    BURN-IN tests your new PC to the limit to make certain that if there is
    a problem, it shows up before your warranty runs out.
    
    BURN-IN makes your computer and drives do electronic pushups and deep
    knee bends for 24 to 72 hours.  By then, the PC will either conk out and
    you can use your warranty or it will last until it's obsolete.  The
    basic rule is that electronic devices usually break during their first
    couple of dozen hours of heavy use or else they will last a long, long
    time.
    
    This program first runs a routine displaying ASCII characters.  Then it
    runs graphics to exercise your CGA, EGA or VGA card.  As soon as it's
    finished, it generates random numbers and stores them on your disks and
    displays them.  Then it erases the numbers and repeats the whole
    exercise over and over and over again.
