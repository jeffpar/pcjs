## Information about "MANAGING YOUR FOOD"

    MANAGING YOUR FOOD (MYF) gives you complete control over your diet. Plan
    your shopping list according to cost and nutritional value.  MANAGING
    YOUR FOOD is designed for use by food manufacturers, restaurant
    managers, dietitians and the home user. It is friendly enough for novice
    and comprehensive enough for the professional dietitian.
    
    The program will track cost, protein, carbohydrates, fat, calories,
    cholesterol, fatty acids, fiber, vitamins, minerals, exchanges, percent
    RDA, and two user-defined fields.  An ingredient database of USDA
    Handbook 8 (4500 ingredients) is available to registered users.
    
    There are over 100 ways to display the information in the files,
    including a shopping list arranged by store and aisle.
    
    Using your own recipes, you can find the nutritional information and
    cost for all ingredients in a meal.  The information can be totaled and
    reported in appropriate percentages.  Since you enter the information
    about your eating habits, MANAGING YOUR FOOD is customized to you.  It's
    not just another diet, but a way to plan your own intake.
