## Information about "ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT 2 OF 2 (1231)"

    Want to create your own text adventure games?  Now, with the ADVENTURE
    GAME TOOLKIT (AGT) you can, and you don't need to know programming!
    
    In text adventures, players assume the roles of characters in a story
    which they read.  But unlike a book story, the reader is able to
    interact with the plot, go different directions, ask questions and do
    things which may lead them to treasure or doom.
    
    Using AGT, game enthusiasts can now transform their wildest fantasies
    into high-quality adventure games -- and teachers and parents, with a
    little imagination, now have a wonderful tool for making riveting games
    that can teach basic subjects, such as history, math, foreign langauges,
    vocabulary development, etc., in a fun and impactful way.
    
    AGT can create complex worlds with up to 200 locations, 100
    inanimate objects (swords, trees, cars, lasers, etc) and 100 animate
    objects (hobbits, orcs, famous persons, etc.).  An AGT game can
    understand a 400-word vocabulary that can include complex (multiple
    actions) and function key macros for common commands for a polished
    result that conforms to the Infocom standard in adventure games so
    anyone can learn to play quickly.
    
    AGT comes with complete instructions (100 page on-disk manual) and a
    sample mini-game that is walked through showing what can be created
    using AGT without requiring the game designer to have programming
    knowledge or experience.  It also contains the source code files for the
    Colossal Cave adventure.  This is an AGT version of the original game
    that was written by Crowther and Woods that was the first adventure game
    ever written.  It is a classic!  The AGT files for this game can be
    played and enjoyed simply as great entertainment or as a platform to
    build upon and/or learn from for the AGT game designer.
