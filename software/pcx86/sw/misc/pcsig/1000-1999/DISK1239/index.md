## Information about "THE AEIUS GRADEBOOK"

    AEIUS offers teachers and administrators with multiple classes a
    versatile way to keep grade records of every sort.  A fast,
    comprehensive program, AEIUS GRADEBOOK handles up to 20 classes of 48
    students each, with 64 assignments per term.
    
    Teachers can grade by letters, numbers, or virtually any known grading
    system.  Student names can be encoded for privacy and security.
    Individual and class grades can be averaged, and adjusted to curves with
    different weights given different assignments and tests.  It keeps tabs
    on missed assignments.  Makeup grades are found at the touch of a key.
    Missing grades can be optionally excused or counted into grade averages.
    Weekly, monthly, and semester averages are generated, displayed, and
    printed for individuals or classes, if desired.  Grade distributions can
    be calculated and graphed, and the teacher's comments printed.
    
    Using a window system to display every facet of the program, AEIUS
    GRADEBOOK guides the user every step of the way.  Help screens are
    always at hand.  Finding and correcting errors is easy.  The ability to
    print out individual and class report cards gives AEIUS an A+.  The
    small amount of RAM memory used permits AEIUS GRADEBOOK to be used on
    nearly any PC.  The 20-page on-disk manual assumes virtually no
    computer knowledge on the part of users, teaches basics, and works its
    way into the program.

         INTRODUCTION

            The Aeius Gradebook and Lecturegrade programs  will  allow
         you  to  spend  more  time  on  teaching  and  less  time  on
         paperwork. We have designed the program around  the  features
         teachers want most, especially ease and speed  of  use.  Both
         programs  have  identical  features  except for the number of
         students a class file will hold. The manual will refer to the
         program as the Gradebook, but the  directions  for  operating
         the Lecturegrade are the same.
            The Aeius Gradebook is distributed as a SHAREWARE program.
         This  means  that  you  are  encouraged to give a copy of the
         program to other teachers.  If you use the program regularly,
         you are expected to buy it.  This makes you a Registered User
         and  you  receive  a  printed  manual,  latest  Master  Disk,
         telephone  support, and receive an opportunity to get program
         updates at half price.  A registration form is  contained  in
         the  Disk-manual  on  the Master Disk.  The registration form
         can also be printed out on your  printer.  Place  the  Master
         Disk in drive A: and type the command:

            REGISTER <return>

         Summary of Program Features 

            The  program uses a window approach for selecting class or
         print options, so that you can make a change on the fly,  and
         immediately  continue  with printing or entering grades.  The
         program can be configured for monochrome or color monitors.
            If  you  momentarily forget how to use the program, a HELP
         window is immediately available on the screen to refresh your
         memory.
            You  can  view grade averages in a window on the screen at
         any time for  your  convenience.  Grades  can  optionally  be
         calculated in percentage or total points form. The program is
         flexible enough to encompass  most  of  the  grading  systems
         being used.
            Makeup grades can be found at the touch of a key.  Missing
         grades can be optionally excused  or  counted  in  the  grade
         averages.  A student's highest or lowest grade can be quickly
         found. The program also  quickly  finds  the  first  or  last
         grades entered or a grade which was entered in error.
            You can easily provide weekly or monthly grade reports  on
         a  class  or individual student basis, using student names or
         student codes. Teachers  comments  can  be  automatically  be
         included  in  individual  printouts  if  you   desire.    Our
         customers report that an individual printout is a very strong
         factor in motivating students to make up missing assignments.
         The program will also optionally  print  out  the  individual
         reports  for  all  students  having  a average lower than the
         value you select.

                                   Page 1




            A  Grade  Posting  report can be automatically printed for
         all classes using student codes.
            Student  rosters can be easily arranged in alphabetical or
         grade rank order.
            Partial  course grades such as homework, tests, and exams,
         can be combined automatically into a composite  course  grade
         with each partial grade weighted.
            You can examine or printout grade distributions for  class
         averages   or   for  individual  assignments.   Z-scores  are
         calculated to help grade on a curve.
            We  know  that  you  will enjoy using your Aeius Gradebook
         program this year and in the years to come.

         Our Philosophy Of Supporting The Program

            Shareware  is  a  method  of  marketing  which  allows the
         program to be  obtained  at  low  cost  or  no  cost  by  the
         prospective customer. We encourage our customers to share the
         program with other teachers and friends. The program can then
         be  operated  and  tested  in  a  school  environment  by the
         prospective customer.  If the customer decides  the  use  the
         program  to  regularly do his or her grades, we depend on the
         willingness of the customer to buy the program, of his or her
         own free will, to obtain revenue for our business. In turn we
         provide  free  technical  telephone  support,  an   excellent
         printed manual, and program updates at half price.
            We solicit suggestions  from  our  customers  on  ways  to
         improve  the  program, and have published a new version every
         year since 1985 based on their letters. Some of the  features
         which  have  been  suggested  by  customers  and added to the
         program over the years include alphabetical  and  grade  rank
         sorting,  Points  Averaging,  a  version  for  large  classes
         (Lecturegrade), multiple school terms in one file, the  Grade
         Posting  printout  with  student codes, automatic printout of
         low student's grades, and the report card printout. It is our
         objective  to  evolve  toward  a gradebook program which will
         meet the needs of educators at all  levels,  while  remaining
         extremely easy to learn and use.

         EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES REQUIRED

            The  Aeius  Gradebook  and   Lecturegrade   programs   are
         compatible  with  the  IBM  personal  computers including the
         PCjr, PC, XT, AT, and PS/2 models. The program also  runs  on
         most IBM compatibles and "Clone" computers. It operates under
         MS/PCDOS Version 2.0 or later operating system software.
            You will need three double  sided,  double  density,  soft
         sector  diskettes  for  the Working Disk, the Backup Disk and
         the Tutorial Disk.  Additional diskettes may be  required  if
         you fill the first disk.  You can also run the program from a
         hard disk.
            A printer is required for printing grade averages or grade
         sheet  reports. Any dot matrix printer or laser printer which
         is compatible with your computer will  be  suitable  for  the
         Aeius Gradebook. The printouts may take up to 80 columns.

         GETTING STARTED

            You can get the Aeius Gradebook  program  up  and  running
         easily, even if you are not used to computers.  DON'T USE THE
         MASTER DISK TO RUN YOUR PROGRAM.  Instead, make up a Tutorial
         Disk  and Working Disk, as explained below.  By following the
         directions in this "GETTING STARTED"  section,  you  will  be
         trying out your new Aeius Gradebook program in a few minutes.
         This section also contains instructions on  starting  up  the
         computer, and setting the computer date.
            The procedure for making up a Working Disk, Tutorial Disk,
         or Backup Disk is as follows:

            1) Boot your computer.
            2) Format a blank disk.
            3) Make up a Tutorial Disk, Working Disk, or Backup Disk.
            4) If you have a hard disk, the hard disk will become your
               Working Disk.

            If  you  are  an  experienced computer user, skip over the
         next two paragraphs and go to the paragraph titled Making  Up
         A  Tutorial Disk, otherwise the next two paragraphs will take
         you through the procedures to boot your computer and format a
         floppy disk.

         Booting The Computer

            "Booting"  is  a  procedure which starts up a computer and
         transfers the operating system into the computer memory.   An
         "operating  system" is the program which writes characters on
         the screen, interprets  keystrokes,  and  operates  the  disk
         drives  and  program  memory.  To boot your computer, place a
         disk containing the DOS (Disk Operating  System)  program  in
         drive A:.  If the power is off, simply turn the power on.  If
         the power is already on, simultaneously press  the  following
         three keys:

         Alt Ctrl Del

            If the power is off, the computer will pause for up to two
         minutes  and  then  the  disk  drive  will  operate  and  the
         operating  system will be transferred to memory. Your may see
         instructions on the screen directing you to  enter  date  and
         time.   If  so, type in the date and time in the format shown
         on the screen (don't type in the name of the day ie. "Mon").
            If  you are using a PCjr computer, the monitor may boot up
         into a 40 column display instead of  the  80  column  display
         which  the  Aeius Gradebook program requires.  A special boot
         file is provided on  the  Master  Disk,  which  automatically
         switches  the  PCjr  to the 80 column mode.  Instructions for
         installing this boot file on  your  Working  Disk  are  given
         later in this section.

                                   Page 4





         Formatting A Disk

            Each  disk  has  to  be  "formatted"  before it can accept
         programs or files.  Formatting is accomplished by running the
         DOS  "format" program.  The disk to be formatted can be a new
         disk or a disk which has been used before.  When the disk  is
         formatted,  any  data on the disk is destroyed. The procedure
         for formatting a disk is as follows:

            1) Boot your computer using the  DOS  disk  supplied  with
               your computer.

            2) Type the command:

            format /s <return>

            (type the space between "format" and "/s")
            ("<return>" means to press the return key.)

            3) When the message "Insert new diskette for drive A:  and
               strike  any  key  when  ready"  appears on your screen,
               remove the DOS disk from drive A:  and  place  a  blank
               disk in drive A:.

            4)  Press  <return>.   The disk drive will operate and the
               disk will be formatted.

            5) When the message "Format another (Y/N)?" appears on the
               screen, press the "n" key.

         Making up A Tutorial Disk

            The  tutorial  included the next section is an easy way to
         become familiar with the program.  If you have a  hard  disk,
         don't run the tutorial from your working subdirectory because
         it may erase your class files.  To make up  a  tutorial  disk
         simply  make  a copy of your master disk and use that as your
         tutorial disk. The copy can be made by placing your DOS  disk
         in  drive A:. Then type the command: DISKCOPY A: B: <return>.
         A message will appear on the screen telling you to place  the
         source  and  target  disks  in your computer. Place the Aeius
         Gradebook Master Disk in drive A: and a blank disk  in  drive
         B:  and  press  <return>.  If your computer has a single disk
         drive, you will be instructed on the screen when  to  replace
         the  Master Disk with your Tutorial Disk.  When you are done,
         label the Tutorial Disk.

         Making Up A Working Disk

            If you have a hard  disk,  skip  to  the  next  paragraph,
         Installing  The  Aeius  Gradebook  On  A Hard Disk, otherwise
         continue with this paragraph to  install  the  program  on  a

                                   Page 5




         floppy  disk.  To  copy  the Aeius Gradebook program onto the
         formatted Working Disk  from  the  Master  Disk,  insert  the
         Master Disk in drive A:.  If your computer has 2 disk drives,
         insert the formatted Working Disk in the right hand drive B:.
         If  your  computer  has  a  single  disk  drive,  you will be
         instructed on the screen when to replace the Master Disk with
         your Working Disk. Now type the command:

         makedisk <return>

            The  "makedisk"  command  will  cause  the programs on the
         Master Disk to be copied onto your Working Disk.
            For PCjr users, a modified  boot  file  can  be  installed
         which switches the display from a 40 column  mode  to  an  80
         column  mode during boot. To add the 80 column switch to your
         boot file, place the Master Disk in drive A: and the  Working
         Disk in drive B: and type the command:

         jr <return>

            A modified AUTOEXEC.BAT file will be transferred  to  your
         Working  Disk  and  instructions  will  appear on your screen
         explaining the procedure for  copying  the  program  MODE.COM
         from a DOS disk to your Working Disk.  When the boot file  is
         modified  and  MODE.COM  has been copied over to your Working
         Disk, your PCjr will automatically convert to the  80  column
         mode when it is booted.
            If you wish to remove the requirement to  enter  the  date
         when  booting  the  Aeius Gradebook program, place the Master
         Disk in drive A: and your Working Disk in drive B:  and  type
         the command:

         nodate <return>

            When  you  have finished making up the Working Disk, place
         your Aeius Gradebook Master Disk back  in  its  envelope  and
         store  it  in a safe place in a vertical position. Label your
         Working   Disk   "Aeius  Working  Disk"  and  add  any  other
         identifying information such as "1st Quarter" etc.

         Installing The Aeius Gradebook On A Hard Disk

            The Aeius Gradebook Master Disk contains a  batch  program
         called  "MAKEHD"  which  will  install  the  program   in   a
         subdirectory   on  your  hard  disk.   Most  hard  disks  are
         designated as drive C:, however if your system uses  a  drive
         designator  other  than  C,  a  second  batch program "SELHD"
         allows you to change the hard disk designator to B:,  D:,  or
         E:.  If your hard disk is not on drive C: the designator must
         be changed  before  you  install  the  Aeius  Gradebook.   To
         designate drive D: as the hard disk drive, type the command:

                                   Page 6





         SELHD D <return>

          Use your own hard disk designator in place of "D".

            The  Aeius  Gradebook can be installed in one or more hard
         disk subdirectories. Each subdirectory will  hold  up  to  20
         classes. Choose a subdirectory name with 8 or less characters
         such as SEMESTR2. Be sure that your hard disk path is at  the
         root  directory  or  at the subdirectory in which you want to
         install the new subdirectory. Then place the Master  Disk  in
         drive  A: and select drive A: as the default drive. Then type
         the command:

         MAKEHD SEMESTR2 <return>

         Use your own subdirectory name in place of "SEMESTR2".  A set
         of directions will appear on your screen.  You can abort  the
         installation  at  this  point  by  pressing  "Ctrl"  and  "C"
         simultaneously.  Otherwise press <return> to proceed with the
         installation.

            Be sure to use the Backup Disk as described  in  the  next
         paragraph.   The program will back up class files to a Backup
         Disk in drive A: by using the  "BACK"  command  as  described
         below.
            The  tutorial  should  not  be  run  from  your  hard disk
         subdirectory because it could possibly overwrite  your  class
         files  and  class  directory.   To use the tutorial, copy the
         entire Master Disk to a second  disk,  as  described  in  the
         "Making  Up  A  Tutorial  Disk" section, and run the tutorial
         from that copy.

          Making Up A Backup Disk

            There are two types of backup. The first type copies files
         from the Working Disk to the Backup Disk one file at  a  time
         using  the DOS COPY command. If you are using a hard disk, or
         have two floppy disk drives, this is the recommended type  of
         backup.  However  if  your computer has a single floppy drive
         and no hard disk, the first type of backup will require  that
         you  change  disks several times in the course of backing up.
         In this case the second type of backup  is  recommended.  The
         second  type  uses  the  DOS  DISKCOPY  program  so  that the
         changing of disks is minimized.  When you make  up  a  Backup
         Disk  as  described below, a file named "BACKUP" is installed
         on the Backup Disk.  This file is checked by the BACK command
         to prevent accidentally backing up to the wrong disk.
            To  make up a Backup Disk, first format a blank disk. Next
         place the Master Disk in drive A: and the disk which will  be
         the  Backup  Disk  in drive B:. If your computer has a single
         disk  drive, you will be instructed by a prompt on the screen

                                   Page 7




         when to switch disks.  Type the command:

         makeback <return>

            The Aeius Gradebook  program  will  be  copied  onto  your
         Backup  Disk.  This  disk  is  used  for  any  of  the backup
         procedures. Label this disk "Backup Disk".
         If you want to use the second type of backup (if you have a
         single floppy drive and no hard disk), place your Working
         Disk (Not your Backup Disk) in the drive and type the
         command:

         copy back1.bat back.bat <return>

         Now place your DOS disk in drive A: and type the command:

         copy diskcopy.com b: <return>

         The drive will operate and  a message will appear telling you
         to place your  Working Disk  (Not Backup Disk)  in the drive.
         Press <return>.   The drive will operate and the DISKCOPY.COM
         program will be copied to your Working Disk.

         Starting Up the Aeius Gradebook Program

            Place  the  Working  Disk  containing  the Aeius Gradebook
         program into disk drive A:. There are three ways to start the
         program.

            1)  If the power has not been turned on, turn on the power
               to  the  computer.  The  computer  will  boot  the  DOS
               operating  system  and the Aeius Gradebook program will
               be started.

            2) If the power is on, simultaneously press the  following
               three keys: Cntl Alt Del

            3)  If  the  computer has been previously booted, type the
               command:

            If you are using Gradebook: GRD <return>
            If you are using Lecturegrade: LECT <return>

            The disk drive will operate, and depending on which of the
         above options you use, you may see a message  on  the  screen
         directing  you  to enter the date. If so, type in the date in
         the form:

            5-1-86

            Do not type in the name of  the  day  such  as  "Mon".   A
         copyright  and  shareware  notice  will appear on the screen.

                                   Page 8




         Press the <return> key a second time,  and  the  first  class
         file  will  be loaded into the computer from the disk. If the
         disk has not been used before,  a  new  class  file  will  be
         created.  The  class  file will then appear on the screen and
         you can begin typing information into it or  you  can  select
         one of the functions.
            You can make the program open to any class  when  starting
         by  typing  the number of the opening class after "GRD".  For
         example if you start the program with   "GRD 5", the  program
         will start up and the fifth class will be displayed.

         Ending The Aeius Gradebook Program

            The  program  starts and ends with the grade sheet.  Press
         the Esc key repeatedly until all of the function windows have
         been erased, and a blinking message "ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
         QUIT? (Y/N)" appears in the upper left  hand  corner  of  the
         screen.  Press  the  "Y"  key  to  quit.  The disk drive will
         operate, the screen will clear, and a  reminder  to  back  up
         your  disk  will  be written on the screen. The computer will
         return to the DOS operating system and will be ready  to  run
         another program.
            If you have pressed the Esc key too many  times  accident-
         ally,  you  can  press  the  "N"  key  to cancel the quit and
         continue on with the program.

         THE AEIUS GRADEBOOK TUTORIAL

            This  tutorial  covers  the  Aeius  Gradebook  and   Aeius
         Lecturegrade programs, but to simplify the text both programs
         will be called "Aeius Gradebook".
            Your Aeius Gradebook Master  Disk  contains  sample  grade
         sheet  files  which are used in conjunction with the tutorial
         instructions  in  this  section  to  demonstrate  all  of the
         features of the program. The Tutorial Disk is simply  a  copy
         of  the  Master Disk. To make up a Tutorial Disk, use the DOS
         DISKCOPY   program   as   described   previously   under  the
         paragraph  "Making  Up  A  Tutorial  Disk".  Mark  this  disk
         "Tutorial".  The Tutorial Disk erases the class  files  after
         you have used it, so be sure not to combine the Tutorial Disk
         and the Working Disk on one diskette or subdirectory.
            The  return  key  is  marked with a left arrow having a up
         pointing tail.  <return> means to press the return  key.   To
         run  the  tutorial,  place  the Tutorial Disk in drive A: and
         type the command:

         tutor<return>

            The following paragraphs  describe  exercises  which  will
         quickly  familiarize  you  with  the  operation of your Aeius
         Gradebook program.
            When the tutorial is started, several files will be copied
         into  position on the disk and the program will be started. A
         copyright and shareware notice will  appear  on  the  screen.
         Press the <return> key again.  The  first  sample  gradesheet
         will appear on the screen.
            The first column of grades on the  sample  gradesheet  are
         letter  grades.   The  second  column  of  grades are "number
         wrong" grades and the third  column  of  grades  are  "number
         right"  grades.   Notice the X's after the 5th name.  An X is
         used to designate an excused grade which is not  included  in
         grade  averages.   Notice  the "*" in the second column after
         the 8th name.  A star (*) designates a  makeup  grade,  which
         can be automatically found and updated at a later date.

         Data Entry and Cursor Control

            Notice  that  the  letter "A" in the grade to the right of
         the student  "Adam,  Dana"  has  a  blinking  underline.  The
         blinking  underline  on  the  screen is called the cursor and
         indicates the location where the next keystroke will  appear.
         Press  the  "b" key.  The grade A+ will change to b+, and the
         cursor will move to the "+".
            Now  locate the cursor keys.  Press the key with the right
         arrow on it.  The cursor will move one grade to the right  to
         "-1".   Press  the down arrow.  The cursor will move down one
         grade to "-0". Press the up arrow, then the left  arrow.  The
         cursor  will  move  up and to the left, ending up at the "b+"
         where it started.

                                   Page 10




            Now press the left arrow. The cursor will move to the name
         "Adam, Dana". Type "Hall". The name "Adam" is  replaced  with
         "Hall".  Press  the  return key. The cursor will move down to
         the next student name. Now move back up  to  the  first  line
         with  the  up cursor key and replace "Hall" with "Adam" again
         so the roster is in alphabetical order.   THE  PROGRAM  LOOKS
         FOR THE FIRST BLANK NAME TO FIND THE END OF THE ROSTER.
            Move the cursor down to the second name and press the left
         arrow  cursor key. The cursor will move to the student number
         column. Type a space, then type  "8".  (Lecturegrade  uses  3
         digits  for  student  number,  so  type 2 spaces and "8") The
         student number "2" will be  replaced  with  the  number  "8".
         Press the return key and the cursor will move down to student
         number "3".
            Use  the  right  cursor  key and up cursor key to move the
         cursor to the  upper  left  grade  "b+"  where  the  tutorial
         started.
            To summarize: The cursor can be moved around the screen by
         pressing  the cursor arrow keys at the right of the keyboard.
         To reach the student names and student numbers, just continue
         to  move  the cursor to the left. The cursor always points to
         the next character to be typed from the keyboard.

         Assignment Entry

            EITHER THE DATE OR THE FIRST CHARACTER OF  THE  ASSIGNMENT
         NAME  MUST  BE  FILLED  IN  FOR A VALID ASSIGNMENT.  Move the
         cursor to the first grade b+. Then use the up  arrow  key  to
         move  the  cursor  up into the assignment area of the screen.
         The first row of the assignment contains the assignment date.
         Type  in  the  correct  date  (including spaces) watching the
         cursor as you type. The  cursor  will  skip  over  the  slash
         marks,  to  reach the next number. Press <return>. The cursor
         will skip to the second row of the assignment containing  the
         assignment  name.  Type  "assignment" and 5 spaces. Press the
         return key. The cursor will move to the "wt"  position.  This
         area  contains  the  weight  of  the  assignment in the grade
         average. The program automatically fills in a default  weight
         of  1.0  when  a new file is created. Type "015". Notice that
         the cursor skips over the decimal point to enter a weight  of
         1.5.  Press the return key. The cursor will skip to the "pts"
         position. "pts" gives the number of points in the assignment.
         The  program  automatically fills in a default value of "100"
         when a new file is  created.  Type  in  a  pts  value  of  13
         followed  by  a  space. Then press the return key. The cursor
         will skip to the next assignment. Now press the  down  cursor
         key followed by the left cursor key. The cursor moves back to
         the grade area at the first grade position.
            To summarize: The assignment area of the gradesheet can be
         reached by moving the cursor up to the top of the screen. The
         assignment  contains  three  lines.  The return key moves the
         cursor from one assignment zone to the next.

         Teachers Comments

            The Aeius Gradebook will print out teachers comments on an
         individual  student  printout  or  on a report card printout.  
         Comment numbers are entered into a COMMENT assignment just as
         though they were grades.  There are 32 possible comments.  An
         assignment whose name begins with a '$' is recognized by  the
         program  as a comment column.  For example an assignment name
         of "$comment" would designate that  assignment  for  comments
         and  would be ignored in computing averages.  You can have as
         many comment columns as you wish.  Enter the  number  of  the
         comment  you  wish  to  have  printed for each student in the
         roster.  A blank comment number or a comment  number  greater
         than 32 is recognized as no comment.  Instructions on editing
         comments are covered under "Utilities Under F2".  

         Class Name Entry

            The class name goes in the upper left corner of the  grade
         sheet. To reach the class name, move the cursor up to the top
         of the screen in the assignment area, then  move  the  cursor
         left  until  it  is  located below the word "CLASS". Now type
         "class one". Notice that some of the original  name  "READING
         1B"  still  remains.  To  erase the remainder of the original
         name, type spaces to the end of the line.

         Correcting Mistakes

            Move the cursor down to  the  second  student  number  "8"
         which  you  entered  earlier.  Make  an  error in the student
         number by typing "23".  To  correct  the  error,  locate  the
         backspace  key in the top row of keys to the right of the "="
         key. Press the backspace key. The cursor will  move  back  to
         the  beginning  of  the  student  number. Press the space bar
         (twice for Lecturegrade)  and  "2"  to  correct  the  student
         number.
            To summarize: The backspace key will move the cursor  back
         to the left to allow you to type over a mistake.

         Gradesheet Pages

            Move the cursor to the far right of the  screen  with  the
         right  arrow  key.  Now press the right arrow cursor key once
         more.  Look at the assignment area at the top of the  screen.
         Notice  that the assignments now start at "2" on the left and
         end  at  "4" on the right. Continue to move the cursor slowly
         to the right until the number 8 assignment is reached. Notice
         that  the  7th  assignment  is  the  last on the sample grade
         sheet. The grade sheet contains a maximum of  64  assignments
         for   the  Aeius  Gradebook  program  and  a  maximum  of  30
         assignments for the Aeius Lecturegrade program.

                                   Page 12




            Move the cursor back to the first grade column by pressing
         F3 then Esc. Now move the cursor down past the 9th name.  The
         first  name  will  disappear  and  names 2 through 10 will be
         displayed on the screen. Locate the PgDn  cursor  key.  Press
         this  key  and  the  cursor will move down 9 names at a time.
         Press the PgDn key repeatedly until the 25th name appears  on
         the  screen.  This  is  the last name in the sample file. The
         gradesheet allows for a maximum of 48 student names  for  the
         Aeius   Gradebook   and  200  student  names  for  the  Aeius
         Lecturegrade program.
            Press  the  PgUp  key.  The  cursor  will move up 9 names.
         Return the cursor to the first name using the PgUp key. Press
         PgUp  again.  Notice  that  the cursor will not move into the
         assignment area.
            Press the End key.  The cursor will move 3 assignments  to
         the right.  Press the Home  key.   The  cursor  will  move  3
         assignments to the left.
            To summarize: The gradesheet  is  organized  in  pages  of
         three  assignments  across  and nine students down. The PgUp,
         PgDn, End, and Home keys can be used to  move  the  cursor  a
         page  length  at  a time. These keys are restricted to moving
         the cursor in the grades area of the gradesheet. To reach the
         class  name,  student  names,  and the assignment area of the
         gradesheet, the cursor arrow keys must be used.

         Using "Smart Keys"

            The  program  provides ways, using a single key stroke, to
         find grades for makeup,  grades  in  error,  first  and  last
         assignments,  and  top or bottom grades for a student.  These
         features can save you valuable time when editing your grades.
            Start this part of the tutorial by moving  the  cursor  to
         the  first  grade  in  the class.  Press F9.  The cursor will
         jump to the next grade with a star (*).  Press F9  repeatedly
         until you reach the last grade on  the  gradesheet.   If  you
         enter a grade with a star in the first  position,  the  grade
         can  be quickly reached with the F9 key. This feature is used
         to  record  grades  which  are  late  or  which   have   been
         resubmitted  as  makeup.  When the makeup is complete, the F9
         key can be used to quickly find  and  update  the  grade.   A
         makeup  grade  is averaged in the same way any other grade is
         averaged. A blank grade is interpreted as a grade of 0%.  The
         excused  grade (x) can be used in combination with a star, or
         by itself, to eliminate that grade from the average.
            Move the cursor back up to the first grade "b+".  For  the
         following  paragraph,  "Ctrl F" means to press the "Ctrl" key
         and the "f" key simultaneously.  Press Ctrl  F  to  move  the
         cursor to the FIRST assignment. Press  Ctrl  L  to  move  the
         cursor  to  the  LAST  assignment.  Press  Ctrl T to move the
         cursor to the TOP ranked grade for the student. Press Ctrl  B
         to  move  the  cursor  to  the  BOTTOM  ranked  grade for the
         student.

                                   Page 13




            Press  F7  to  display the class averages. Notice that the
         3rd student average is in  error.  Press  Esc  to  erase  the
         average  window.  Press Ctrl E to find the grade which was in
         ERROR. The cursor will move  to  3rd  student  assignment  6.
         Correct  the  error in the grade and press F7 to confirm that
         the grade average is now valid.

         Let's Try The Functions

            Locate the function keys marked F1 through F10. These keys
         select  special  functions  such  as changing grade sheets or
         printing. Lets try them to see what happens.
            Press F1.  F1 puts a HELP window up on the screen.   Press
         the space bar to get another page of HELP.  Press the Esc key
         in  the  top  row of keys. The HELP window will disappear and
         you will be back at the grade  sheet  again.  Press  F3.  The
         Class  Select Directory window will appear on the screen. Now
         press F1 again. The HELP window will appear  over  the  Class
         Select  Directory  window. Press Esc. The HELP window will be
         overlaid, putting you back  in  the  Class  Select  Directory
         window.  We will  delay  using  the  Class  Select  Directory
         window until a later paragraph.  Press Esc again to return to
         the grade sheet.
            Press F5.  The  grade  sheet  will  be  reorganized  in  a
         compressed  format  with the student name and the assignments
         eliminated from the display. Press the  End  key  and  notice
         that the cursor moves 12 grades to the right.  Press the Home
         key and the cursor moves back 12 grades to the  left.   Press
         F5 again to return to the normal format.
            Press  the F7 function key.  The grade average window will
         appear  giving the average for each student in percentage and
         letter grade. Press the PgDn cursor key. The averages of  the
         next 9 students will be displayed. Press the PgUp cursor key.
         The averages of the first 9 students will be displayed again.
         Press  Esc to return to the grade sheet. Return the cursor to
         the first grade position "b+".
            Press  F8.  The  student names will be replaced by student
         codes. The word "CODES" will  appear  highlighted  above  the
         student  names.  Coded  names can be used to post grades when
         you want to maintain anonymity. Press F8 again to  return  to
         the student names.

         Setting Grade Equivalents

            The  Aeius  Gradebook program provides maximum flexibility
         for setting the  correspondence  between  letter  grades  and
         their  percentage  equivalents.  A set of equivalents for all
         classes on the disk is  provided  with  the  program,  called
         STANDARD   EQUIVALENTS.  You  can  set  your  own  customized
         equivalents for all classes on the  disk,  called  CUSTOMIZED
         EQUIVALENTS  FOR  THE  DISK.  You can set your own customized
         equivalents for a single class on the disk, called CUSTOMIZED

                                   Page 14




         EQUIVALENTS  FOR CLASS. The equivalents for a given class can
         be changed from one of the three options to  another  at  any
         time.  For  example, if you have set up grade equivalents for
         the disk and then set up special grade  equivalents  for  the
         first  class  on  the  disk, the program allows you to easily
         switch back and forth between the two  sets  of  equivalents.
         This  would  allow  you  to  average grades for a given class
         against a standard table of equivalents or to average  grades
         on a curve using a second set of equivalents. Initially, when
         you make up a new working disk, the grade equivalents are set
         to the STANDARD EQUIVALENTS.

         Grade Equivalents For The Disk

            Now continue with the tutorial by pressing F6.  An Average
         menu  will  appear on your screen with the first line, SELECT
         STANDARD EQUIVALENTS FOR DISK highlighted.   Press  <return>.
         The prompt STANDARD EQUIVALENTS will be highlighted near  the
         bottom  of  the  screen.  Press F6 again to get the Averaging
         menu. Use the down cursor key to move the highlight  down  to
         the  second line: SET/SELECT CUSTOMIZED EQUIVALENTS FOR DISK.
         Press <return>. A new menu will be  overlaid  on  the  screen
         with  the  first  line  ENTER  LETTER  TO PERCENT EQUIVALENTS
         highlighted. The prompt CUSTOMIZED EQUIVALENTS FOR DISK  will
         be  highlighted  on  the  screen.   Press Esc.  We will press
         <return> later in the tutorial to practice changing the grade
         equivalents.   Move  the  highlight  up  to  SELECT  STANDARD
         EQUIVALENTS FOR DISK and press <return>.  The prompt STANDARD
         EQUIVALENTS will again be highlighted.
            To  summarize:  Either  standard or customized equivalents
         can  be  selected  for  use  with all classes on your working
         disk.
            Press  F6  again  and move the highlight to the second row
         SET/SELECT CUSTOMIZED EQUIVALENTS FOR DISK.  Press  <return>.
         The  second  window  with ENTER LETTER TO PERCENT EQUIVALENTS
         highlighted will  appear  and  the  prompt  CUSTOMIZED  GRADE
         EQUIVALENTS  FOR  DISK will appear.  Press <return>.  A table
         of letter to percent equivalents will appear  on  the  screen
         with  the cursor to the left of the percentage "89.0". Type a
         space and the number "901". Press the down  cursor  key.  The
         new  percent  equivalent  of 90.1% will appear for A+ and the
         cursor moves to the second row. Type a space and "960" in the
         second  row.  Whoops!  It  should have been "860". To correct
         this mistake, press the backspace key to move the cursor back
         under  the  "9".  Then type "8" to get the correct percentage
         86.0%. Use the up arrow cursor key to move the cursor back up
         to  the  first  row. Press <return> to save the new letter to
         percent table. When you end the Aeius Gradebook  program  the
         new  table  will be saved on your disk so the program will be
         ready to use your customized equivalents for the disk at  the
         next  session. Press F6 again and then <return> to get to the
         second window. Move the highlight down to  ENTER  PERCENT  TO

                                   Page 15




         LETTER  EQUIVALENTS  and  press  return.  A  window  appears,
         containing the table of percent  to  letter  equivalents.  In
         this  case there is a high and low range of percentage values
         which correspond to a single letter  grade.  (These  tutorial
         tables  are  chosen for demonstration purposes only. Normally
         the highest equivalent would go to 100.0%.) Move  the  cursor
         down  to the third row. Type a space and "820", then move the
         cursor up one row. Notice that the value in the  low  percent
         column  of  the  second  row  automatically changes to 82.1%.
         Press Esc. The new table will not be saved unless <return> is
         pressed  in  the  previous line. Press Esc twice to erase the
         utility windows.
            To summarize: The letter to percent  equivalents  and  the
         percent  to  letter  equivalents , for all classes on a disk,
         can be set to your own standards.  When you change one table,
         a blinking prompt reminds you to change the other table.

         Grade Equivalents For A Single Class

            Press  F6 again.  Move the cursor down to the fourth line,
         SET/SELECT  CUSTOMIZED  EQUIVALENTS  FOR  CLASS,  and   press
         return.   When the next window appears, move the highlight up
         to  the  first  line,  and  press  <return> again. A table of
         letter to percent equivalents  will  appear  on  the  screen.
         Let's  stop  a  moment  to  review why we have two equivalent
         tables and what they are used for.   The  LETTER  TO  PERCENT
         table  is  used to convert letter grades to percent values so
         that a percentage  average  of  a  student's  grades  can  be
         computed.  Once  the  percent  average  is computed, a second
         table is needed to convert the average percent grade back  to
         a letter.  The PERCENT TO LETTER table does this by assigning
         a percentage range to each letter grade.  Since we  practiced
         changing  the  tables  in  the preceding paragraphs, we won't
         repeat the exercise.  Press <return> to return to  the  grade
         sheet.   The  prompt  USING  CUSTOMIZED GRADE EQUIVALENTS FOR
         CLASS  will  appear  on  the  screen  to  remind  you   which
         equivalents  are  being  used for averaging.  Press F7 to see
         the customized averages for this class. Press F6 and move the
         highlight   to   the   second   line   SET/SELECT  CUSTOMIZED
         EQUIVALENTS FOR DISK and press <return>. A  prompt  YOU  MUST
         RETURN  TO DISK EQUIV FIRST will flash on the screen, to tell
         you that you  cannot  select  disk  equivalents  while  class
         equivalents  are selected. Press F6 and move the highlight to
         the third line RETURN TO DISK EQUIVALENTS FOR THIS CLASS  and
         press <return>. The prompt STANDARD EQUIVALENTS or CUSTOMIZED
         EQUIVALENTS FOR DISK will appear on the screen to  show  that
         the  customized  equivalents  for this class are no longer in
         use. Press F7 and a new set of averages will appear using the
         disk letter grade to percent equivalents. Press Esc to return
         to the grade sheet.
            To   Summarize:   You   can   switch   between  customized
         equivalents for a particular class and standard or customized

                                   Page 16




         equivalents for the disk easily. Normally most teachers would
         use a single set of letter to percent equivalents for all  of
         their classes, but the program provides the extra flexibility
         of selecting special equivalents for any particular class.

         Selecting Class Files With F3

            Return the cursor to the first  grade  position  "b+"  and
         press  F3.   The Class Select Directory window will appear on
         the screen which contains the names of the class files.  Only
         the  first  three  class  files are used on the Tutorial Disk
         even though 20 file names are listed.  Press the down  cursor
         key.   The second class will be highlighted.  Press <return>.
         The disk will operate and the class file on the  screen  will
         be  replaced  with  the second class file. Move the cursor to
         the class name position in  the  upper  left  corner  of  the
         screen  and  type  in  "class  2". Press F3. The class select
         window will appear with the new "class 2" name  appearing  in
         the  second  position.   Use  the down cursor key to move the
         highlight  to  position  11.   Class  numbers 11 thru 20 will
         appear in the window.  Move the highlight back up to the 10th
         class  with  the  up  cursor key.  The first ten classes will
         appear in the window.  Move the highlight  up  to  the  first
         class and press <return>. The "class 2" file will be saved on
         disk  and the first class file will be read into the computer
         and displayed on the screen.
            Press  F7.   The  grade  average window will appear on the
         screen.  Press F3.  The Class Select  Directory  window  will
         appear  next  to the average window.  Move the highlight down
         to the second class and press <return>.  The "class  2"  file
         will  be  retrieved from the disk and the average window will
         display the averages of "class 2".  Reselect the first  class
         by using the F3 window as described above.  Press the Esc key
         to erase the average window.
            To  summarize:  The  F3  function key allows you to change
         class files at any time, even  when  you  are  using  another
         function  such  as  averaging.  The currently active class is
         displayed in the Class Select Directory window in  highlight.
         The  cursor  keys  are used to move the highlight to the next
         class to be selected.  The <return> key causes  the  previous
         class to be saved on disk, and the newly selected class to be
         retrieved from disk and displayed  along  with  the  function
         window which was being used.

         Printing With F4

            If  your  computer does not have a printer you will not be
         able to use this section of the tutorial.
            Using F3, select the first gradesheet. Make sure that your
         printer is on line and that the paper is  positioned  at  the
         top of the page. Press F4. The printing menu will appear in a
         window. The first row should be highlighted. If not, move the

                                   Page 17




         highlight  up to the first row with the up cursor key so that
         PRINT CLASS AVERAGES  is  highlighted.  Press  <return>.  The
         averages  and  grades  for  the  first class will be printed.
         Notice that a blinking prompt  notifies  you  which  term  is
         being  averaged.  In this case all grades are averaged, since
         we didn't select a term. Move the highlight down to PRINT ALL
         CLASS   AVERAGES   and   press  <return>.  The  program  will
         automatically get each of the classes on the disk  and  print
         all averages.
            In summary: The program will print the averages and grades
         for  all students in a single class or for all classes on the
         disk.
            Press  F4 and move the highlight down to PRINT GRADE SHEET
         and press <return>. A message  "Print  grade  sheet  starting
         with  assignment  1" will be displayed with the cursor at the
         space just before "1". Press the space bar then "7"  to  tell
         the  program  to begin printing grades at the 7th assignment,
         then press <return>. A message on the screen tells  you  that
         printing is in process.

         Printing Grade Posting

            When  the  grade  sheet  printing is complete, press F8 to
         display the student codes. Press F4 and  move  the  highlight
         down  to  PRINT  GRADE  POSTING  and  press  <return>.  Press
         <return>  again  to  select  the  printing  to   start   with
         assignment  1.  All  assignments will be printed on the first
         page and a compressed summary of grades will  be  printed  on
         the  following pages. Press F8 again to return to the student
         names. Print the grade posting again. Now the  student  names
         will be abbreviated to 12 characters in the printout. You may
         want to use F2 to sort the roster in grade  rank  order,  and
         erase  student  numbers,  and  use  student  codes  for  this
         printout, to provide anonymity.
            Press F4 and move the highlight down to PRINT  AUTO  GRADE
         POSTING and press <return>. The program will print the  grade
         posting  for  all  classes  (except  blank  classes) with the
         student roster sorted in grade rank order  and  with  student
         codes  selected.  At  the  end  of  each  class the roster is
         resorted in alphabetical order. The Esc key can  be  used  to
         abort printing at any time.
            In  summary:  The program will print all grades in a class
         in  normal  or  posting  format. The early assignments can be
         optionally skipped to save paper. The program will also print
         grade postings for all classes automatically.

         Printing Individual Reports

            Press  F4  and  move  the  highlight  down  to  PRINT  ONE
         STUDENT'S GRADES. Press <return>. A student name will  appear
         in  a  window.  Press the down cursor key to display the next
         student name in the window and press  <return>.  The  grades,

                                   Page 18




         percent average, and letter average will be printed.
            Press Esc, then  move  the  highlight  down  to  SET  PAGE
         LENGTH.   We  are  going to print two reports on one sheet to
         save paper.  Press <return>.   A  window  will  appear  which
         allows  you  to  select  the  page  length.  The default page
         length is 66 lines.  Type in a  page  length  of  "33",  then
         press  <return>.   Move  the  highlight  on the print menu to
         PRINT ALL STUDENTS GRADES, but don't press return yet. We are
         going  to  print  3  or 4 student averages and then abort the
         printouts to avoid printing the averages for all 25 students.
         Now  press  <return>.  The  program  will begin printing each
         student's grades and  averages  in  turn.  The  name  of  the
         student  being  printed will be displayed on the screen. When
         the third student comes up on the screen, press the  Esc  key
         to  abort  printing.  Depending  on when you pressed Esc, the
         printing will stop at the 3rd or 4th student. When  you  have
         completed  printing,   change the page length back to "66" as
         described above. Press Esc to erase the  print  window  from
         the screen.
            In  summary:  An  individual student's grades and averages
         can be printed. The individual averages of  all  students  in
         the  class  can also be printed in one selection.  Short page
         lengths can be selected for  individual  reports  and  report
         cards to save paper.
            Press  F4  and  move  the  highlight  down  to  PRINT  LOW
         STUDENT'S GRADES and press <return>. A Low Average  Selection
         window  will be displayed with the default percentage of 70.0
         displayed. Type in the low average of space  then  "731"  and
         press  return. The cursor will skip over the decimal point to
         give a low average  of  73.1.  The  program  will  print  out
         individual student reports for each student having an average
         of less than 73.1%.
            Press  F4  and move the highlight down to PRINT LOW GRADES
         ALL CLASSES and press <return>. Press <return> to select  the
         default  of  70.0%.  Now  the program will go through all the
         classes on the disk and print the individual printout for any
         student  in  any  class  who  has an average less than 70.0%.
         Press Esc to return to the Print menu.
            In summary: Individual student printouts, for each student
         whose average grade is less than your minimum  standard,  can
         be  automatically  printed  for  a  single  class  or for all
         classes on the disk.

         Printing Report Card With Comments

            Move the cursor down to COMMENTS ON/OFF.  The  right  side
         of  the  line should indicate "COMMENTS OFF".  Press <return>
         to select "COMMENTS ON".  Move the cursor up to PRINT  REPORT
         CARD.  Press  <return>.  The computer will read all the class
         files  on  the  disk  and  sort   the   student   names   and
         corresponding  grades.  A window will display a student name.
         Use the down arrow key until the 5th student is displayed  in

                                   Page 19




         the  window  and  then  press <return>. A report card for the
         selected student will be printed with a teachers comment. You
         can also print the report card for all the  students  in  the
         class.  Now turn  the  comments  off  by  selecting  COMMENTS
         ON/OFF and pressing <return>.
            In Summary:  Teachers comments can optionally  be  printed
         on a report card or individual student printout.
            Press F4 and move the highlight down to PRINT  ROSTER  AND
         STUDENT  CODES  and press <return>. A list of all students in
         the class  and  their  corresponding  student  code  will  be
         printed. Press F4 again and move the highlight down to FEED A
         BLANK PAGE and press <return>. A blank page will be  fed  out
         of the printer so that the last printed page can be torn off.
         Press Esc to erase the Print menu.

         Grade Averaging Options With F6

            Press F3 and select the second class. Then press  F6.  The
         first  four  lines  of  the  Averaging  menu handle letter to
         percent equivalents as previously explained. The  last  three
         lines of the menu allow you to select a term for averaging or
         to  select  percentage or points grade averaging. The default
         selections are AVERAGE ALL  GRADES  and  AVERAGE  PERCENTAGE.
         Press Esc to erase the Averaging menu.
            The  Aeius  Gradebook program has the capability to handle
         multiple terms  (semesters,  quarters,  months,  etc.)  in  a
         single  grade sheet. The end of a term is signified by a star
         in the first character of the assignment name.  The  tutorial
         grade  sheet  has  divided  the  grade sheet into two monthly
         terms. To view the end of the first term, use the End key  to
         move  out  to  the  8th  assignment.  Notice that the the 8th
         assignment name begins with a star.  When the assignment name
         is  entered  with  a  star  (*) as the first character of the
         assignment name, the  program  automatically  fills  all  the
         grades  with  "X's"  so  the  column  will  be ignored in the
         averages.  Now press F6 and move the highlight  down  to  SET
         TERM  and  press  <return>.  A  window will appear which will
         allow you to select the term to  be  averaged.  The  blinking
         cursor  will  appear  after the prompt ENTER NUMBER 1 TO 9 TO
         SELECT TERM. Type a "2" to select the second term, then press
         <return>.  Press F7 to view the averages for the second term.
         Press  F6 again, then press <return> twice without entering a
         term number. Press F7 to view the averages. The averages  for
         all grades on the grade sheet are displayed if a term  number
         is  not  selected.  The  selected term is used by the program
         until it is changed. Both displayed and printed averages  use
         the term number selection. A blinking prompt always tells you
         which grades are being averaged. Press Esc to  erase  Average
         window.

         Points And Percentage Averages

            Press F6 and move the  highlight  down  to  SELECT  POINTS
         AVERAGING  and  press  <return>.  At  the  lower left of your
         screen, a highlighted prompt reminds you that you  are  using
         the  POINTS  method of averaging grades. Press F7 and examine
         the  averages.  Notice  that  the  screen  lists the AVERAGE,
         GRADE, POSSIBLE PTS, and SCORED PTS. Press Esc to  erase  the
         window.  Points  Averaging  means that the program totals the
         weighted scores which you enter as grades (in "number  right"
         or  "number  wrong"  formats  only)  and  divides those total
         scores  by  the  total  of  the assignment "pts" values. This
         ratio is the AVERAGE. The  program  will  not  accept  letter
         grades  if  you  choose  to  use  the  POINTS grade averaging
         method. Your averaging method is saved on the  disk,  so  you
         only have to make this selection once at the beginning of the
         school year or when you make up a new disk.
            Press F6 and move the highlight up  to  SELECT  PERCENTAGE
         AVERAGING  and press <return>. The highlighted prompt on your
         screen now tells you that you are using the percentage method
         of  averaging  grades. Press F7. Notice that the averages now
         show only the AVERAGE and GRADE. Percentage  averaging  means
         that  each  grade  (letter, number right, or number wrong) is
         first converted to a percentage  by  looking  it  up  in  the
         letter   to   percent  equivalent  tables,  or  dividing  the
         numerical  score  by  the  assignment  "pts" value.  Then the
         percentage grades  are  totaled  and  divided  by  the  total
         weighted number of assignments.  Press Esc to erase averages.
            To  summarize: A school year consisting of multiple school
         terms can be handled on a single grade sheet. F6  allows  you
         to  average  the  grades  in  any  term  or  for all terms in
         combination. Either PERCENTAGE  or  POINTS  method  of  grade
         averaging can be selected.

         Statistics

            Press  F6 and move the highlight down to the bottom of the
         menu  to  COMPUTE  STATISTICS  and   press   <return>.    The
         distribution  of grades for the class will be displayed along
         with the Mean, Standard Deviation,  and  Median.   The  class
         name is displayed at the upper left of the screen.  Press 'P'
         to print the statistics.  Press 'Z' and the Z-scores will  be
         displayed.   Press  'P'  to print the Z-scores.  A Z-score is
         the difference between the score and the Mean, divided by the
         Standard  Deviation.   Z-scores  are  helpful in grading on a
         curve.  Press Esc to return to the  statistical  distribution
         screen.   Move  the  cursor to the second assignment with the
         right arrow  cursor  key.   Press  <return>  to  display  the
         statistics  for  the  second assignment.  The assignment name
         will be displayed at the upper left of the screen.  Press  F3
         and  select  the  first  class.  The statistics for the first
         class will be displayed  on  the  screen.   When  you  change

         classes  the  class  distribution  is  displayed and when you
         change assignments the assignment distribution is  displayed.  
         Press Esc to get back to the grade sheet.
            To summarize:  Statistics for a class or a assignment  can
         be  calculated  by  selecting  COMPUTE  STATISTICS  from  the
         Averaging menu.  Z-scores can also be displayed  and  printed
         to help in grading on a curve.  

         Select Colors

            Change to the first class READING 1B using F3. Press F2 to
         display the Utilities window.  Move  the  highlight  down  to
         SELECT  DISPLAY  COLORS and press <return>. A color selection
         menu will be displayed.   If you have  a  monochrome  monitor
         you  can  select either white on black or reversed display by
         pressing 'W' or 'R'. White on black is the default selection.  
         If  you  have  a  color  monitor you can select the character
         color, the background color and the high intensity color from
         this  menu.   Press  'B'  to  select  any of the 8 background
         colors in succession.  Press 'C' to  select  any  of  the  16
         character  colors.   Press  'H'  to select any of the 16 high
         intensity colors.  When you have  finished  your  selections,
         press  <return>  to  save the color selection or press Esc to
         cancel it.  A favorite selection is  white  on  blue  with  a
         yellow  high intensity.  When the character selection and the
         background selection are identical  the  screen  goes  blank.  
         The  color  selection is stored in the "CLSDIR" file (LECTDIR
         for  Lecturegrade).   If  you  accidentally  select  a  blank
         screen, you can recover by erasing the directory file but you
         will also lose your class names.  Press Esc to return to  the
         grade entry screen.

         Edit Teacher's Comments

            Press  F2 and move the highlight to EDIT COMMENTS FILE and
         press <return>.  A window will be overlaid on the screen with
         the  first  comment  displayed.   Use  the up and down cursor
         arrow  keys  to  select  the  third   comment  for   editing.  
         Comments  are  edited in the overstrike mode.   The right and
         left arrow keys will move  the  cursor  within  the  comment.  
         Move  the  cursor  to the end of the first word "Follows" and
         type over the rest of the line  "the  teacher's  directions".  
         Press the 'P' key to print the list of comments.  Your edited
         comments are saved on disk by pressing <return>  or  just  to
         the  end  of  the session by pressing Esc.  Press <return> to
         save the edited comments to disk.

         Fill In Student Numbers

            Now we will explore some  utilities  which  will  make  it
         easier for you to set up new grade sheets at the beginning of
         a term.  Press F2 and move the highlight to "FILL IN  STUDENT

                                   Page 22




         NUMBERS",  and  press  the  <return>  key.  A  window will be
         overlaid on the screen with the prompt "First student  number
         is  1"  and  a  second  prompt "Number of students is 1". The
         cursor will be on the first line in front of the "1". Type in
         "50"  ("050"  for Lecturegrade) and press the return key. The
         cursor will skip to the second line "number of  students  is"
         in  front  of  the "1". Type in "25" ("025" for Lecturegrade)
         and press  the  return  key.  The  student  numbers  will  be
         redisplayed  from  50  to  75.  This  utility is provided for
         convenience of making up new class rosters. It  can  also  be
         used  to  remove student numbers when using the grade posting
         printout by filling in the student numbers from 1 to 1.

         Automatically Generate Student Codes

            Press F2 and move  the  highlight  down  to  AUTOMATICALLY
         ASSIGN  SECRET  CODES  and  press  <return>. The program will
         automatically generate a set of random student codes based on
         the  names  in the roster. The random codes will be identical
         from one roster to another only  if  the  student  names  are
         typed EXACTLY the same way in both rosters. The safest way to
         assure that the codes match from one class to another  is  to
         use  COPY STUDENT ROSTER TO ANOTHER CLASS. Press F8 to return
         to student names.

         Duplicate Student Roster

            Press F2 and move  the  highlight  down  to  COPY  STUDENT
         ROSTER TO ANOTHER CLASS. Press <return> and a class directory
         will appear overlaid on the utility menu. This utility allows
         you to copy a  student  roster  to  another  class.  This  is
         normally used at the beginning of the year to duplicate class
         rosters. Move the highlight on the  class  directory  to  the
         second class "class 2" and press <return>. A blinking warning
         appears telling you "CLASS NOT EMPTY, TRANSFER  NAMES?(Y/N)".
         If  the  class  contains grades the program warns you so that
         you  won't  accidentally  copy  a  roster to the wrong class.
         Press "n" since we don't want to change the roster. Press Esc
         twice to erase the Utility window. Use F3 to select the first
         class  again. Now select COPY STUDENT ROSTER TO ANOTHER CLASS
         again  from  the F2 utility menu and press <return>. Move the
         highlight to the 3rd  class  with  a  blank  name  and  press
         <return>.  Now  the program will copy the student roster from
         the first class to the third class since the third  class  is
         empty.  This  function copies student names, student numbers,
         and student codes from one class to another. If the  selected
         class  does  not  exist, the program creates a new gradesheet
         file containing the student roster. Press Esc  twice.  Select
         the  3rd  class using F3, and verify that the roster has been
         copied correctly.  Use F3 to select the first class again.

         Insert or Delete a Student

            Press F2 and move the highlight down to INSERT NEW STUDENT
         and  press  the  return key. The prompts "MOVE CURSOR TO NAME
         POSITION" and "THEN PRESS <RETURN>" will appear on the screen
         and  the  cursor  will be positioned to the left of the first
         student number. Move the cursor down to  the  fifth  student.
         Then  press  the  return key. The remaining student names and
         grades will be moved down one position and "XXX" will  appear
         in the fifth position name with a blank grade row.
            Press F2 and move the highlight down to DELETE STUDENT  on
         the  Utility  menu and press the return key.  Move the cursor
         to the student "XXX".  Press the return key.  The new student
         will  be removed from the roster along with the corresponding
         grades. The remaining student names and grades will be  moved
         up one position.

         Sort Student Roster

            Press  F2  and move the highlight down to SORT STUDENTS BY
         GRADE RANK ORDER. The student names  will  be  rearranged  in
         grade  rank  order.  Press F7 to verify the grade rank order.
         Press F2 and move  the  highlight  up  to  SORT  STUDENTS  IN
         ALPHABETICAL  ORDER. The student roster will be rearranged in
         alphabetical order. Sometimes you may wish to place a student
         out of alphabetic order, such as placing a student who  joins
         the  class late at the end of the alphabetic class list. This
         can be accomplished by prefixing a letter to the name when it
         is entered, such as changing "Smith, John" to "Z:Smith, John.

         Combine Class Averages

            Use F3 to change to the 3rd class with a blank name. Press
         F2  and  move the highlight to COMBINE CLASS AVERAGES IN THIS
         CLASS. A class directory  window  will  be  overlaid  on  the
         Utility  Menu.  Move  the highlight to the first class "class
         one" and press <return>. The program  will  fetch  the  first
         class,  compute  averages  for  the  class,  and transfer the
         averages  to  the  first  assignment  in  the  3rd class. The
         averages will be rounded to 2 digits. The class  name  "class
         one" will appear in  the  assignment  name.  Now  repeat  the
         process  for the second class "class 2". The averages for the
         second class will be transferred to the second assignment  in
         "CLASS  AVERAGES".  Press Esc twice then press F7 to view the
         averages. Once the averages have  been  transferred,  weights
         can  be  assigned  to  each  of  the  averages. This powerful
         feature can be used  to  combine  grade  components  such  as
         homework,  quizzes,  and  tests  into one composite grade. It
         could also be used to combine spelling, reading, and  grammar
         into  one composite English grade. The program does not check
         names  against  grades  so BE SURE ALL COMPONENT CLASSES HAVE
         THE  SAME  ROSTER,  AND  THAT  THE  ROSTERS  ARE  ALL  SORTED

                                   Page 24




         ALPHABETICALLY. Otherwise you will get scrambled averages. It
         is  a  good  idea to save a blank class file on your disk for
         combining grades. The class file can be erased and used  over
         again.

         Erase Grade Sheet

            Press  F2 and move the highlight up to ERASE ASSIGNMENTS &
         GRADES, SAVE NAMES. Press the return key. When the prompt "DO
         YOU  WANT  TO ERASE THIS CLASS? (y/n)" appears, press the "y"
         key. All assignments and grades will be erased.  Notice  that
         all  assignment  "wt" are set to 1.0 and all assignment "pts"
         are set to 100. This utility is  handy  for  starting  a  new
         school term without having to retype the student names.

         Quitting The Aeius Gradebook Program

            When you have  completed  your  Aeius  Gradebook  session,
         press  the  Esc  key  repeatedly  until all windows have been
         erased. Then press the Esc key once more. A blinking  message
         will  appear  in the upper left hand corner of the screen "DO
         YOU REALLY WANT TO QUIT? (Y/N)." Press the "Y" key. The  disk
         drive  will  operate to save the grade sheet you were working
         on,  then  the  screen  will  clear and a message will appear
         reminding you to back up your Working Disk.

AEIUS offers teachers and administrators with multiple classes a        
versatile way to keep grade records of every sort.  A fast,             
comprehensive program, AEIUS GRADEBOOK handles up to 20 classes of 48   
students each, with 64 assignments per term.                            
                                                                        
Teachers can grade by letters, numbers, or virtually any known grading  
system.  Student names can be encoded for privacy and security.         
Individual and class grades can be averaged, and adjusted to curves with
different weights given different assignments and tests.  It keeps tabs 
on missed assignments.  Makeup grades are found at the touch of a key.  
Missing grades can be optionally excused or counted into grade averages.
Weekly, monthly, and semester averages are generated, displayed, and    
printed for individuals or classes, if desired.                         
                                                                        
Using a window system to display every facet of the program, AEIUS      
GRADEBOOK guides the user every step of the way.  Help screens are      
always at hand.  Finding and correcting errors is easy.  The ability to 
print out individual and class report cards gives AEIUS an A+.  Although
a hard disk is recommended, the small amount of RAM memory used permits 
AEIUS GRADEBOOK to be used on nearly any PC.  The 20-page on-disk manual
assumes virtually no computer knowledge on the part of users, teaches   
basics, and works its way into the program.
