## Information about "SCOUT-EM (EMS VERSION OF SCOUT)"

    Put your expanded/extended memory to good use with SCOUT-EM. This is
    the expanded memory version of SCOUT, the disk/directory/file manager
    and DOS shell. All of the functions of SCOUT are available and when
    loaded into EM, SCOUT-EM only uses 15.4K of normal memory.
    
    Point-and-shoot menus, "hotkey" capability, user-designed menus and
    command files, assignable function keys, and immediate access to DOS
    are available from memory-resident SCOUT-EM. Format 5.25" or 3.5"
    disks from within your current spreadsheet or word processor, sort
    files five different ways, save screens to disk, and print CGA
    graphics screens. Perform DOS functions without leaving the comfort of
    your text editor.
    
    SCOUT-EM is preconfigured to support 180 directories with 650 files
    each. More can be added as long as you have the memory to support
