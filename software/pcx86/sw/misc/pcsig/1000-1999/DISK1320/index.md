## Information about "DISKCAT"

    DISKCAT is a floppy disk cataloging program for hard disk-based
    systems. Files from each disk are automatically read by the program and
    put into the catalog. The catalog records the file name, size, and
    extension. DISKCAT allows you to add your own description of the file
    and the file category. Afterwards, you may search for a file or print
    a report by disk, by file name, or by file category. DISKCAT will also
    print 1-7/16" x 5"-sized disk labels.
    
    DISKCAT is not only a convenient way to keep track of what programs you
    have and where they are located, but it also allows you to
    describe each file so you can immediately recall the program's usage.
