## Information about "PRO FOOTBALL LINEMAKER"

    The PRO FOOTBALL LINEMAKER program uses the results of past football
    games to project the results of future games.  You update the database
    with stats from this week's games (available in most national and local
    newspapers), then scores and expected statistical results for next
    week's games can be projected.  The program will project the expected
    results of a game between any two teams selected.
    
    In addition to providing you with the expected point spread between the
    two teams, you are provided with valuable information such as: projected
    passing, rushing, and total play yardages, projected first downs,
    projected lost fumbles, projected time of possession, projected times
    sacked, and much more.
    
    You can generate a printout showing a detailed analysis of how the
    projections were calculated, select a less detailed printout of the
    projections, or have the projections displayed only to your monitor.
    The program also allows you to get involved in the development of the
    spreads, projections, and statistical categories used.
