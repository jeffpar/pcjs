## Information about "THESAUR/THESAUR PLUS"

    Searching for the right word to say what you really mean?  This
    computerized thesaurus should help you become both more stylish and
    concise (make that succinct!) in all your writing and prepared speeches.
    
    Add panache to your letters, eloquence to your term papers, and a Phi
    Beta Kappa impact to your speaking endeavors by spending just few
    minutes with THESAUR.  When you call up a word, you are provided an
    array of synonyms and related words.  Set the pointer over your synonym
    of choice and you get a definition to confirm its aptness.
    
    There are over 10,000 main words and close to 50,000 synomyms in THESAUR
    The program also allows you to add your own words as synomyms, and even
    delete words that you think are inappropriate.
    
    THESAUR PLUS is a pop-up thesaurus, whenever you need a different word
    or a different shade of meaning than the word that comes to mind, pop-up
    THESAUR PLUS and get the word you wanted, but couldn't quite remember!
    
    THESAUR PLUS was designed with simplicity in mind.  You only need to
    remember your Hot-key (the key combination you use to pop THESAUR PLUS
    up over what you are doing now) to use the program!
    
    You can look up the word at your cursor, or call the thesaurus and type
    a word to reference.  With the registered version, if you don't like the
    synonyms THESAUR PLUS comes with, you can easily change them; allows
    full style editing with insert, overstrike, and delete.

                       Thesaur Plus Important Information
                             Released April 1990
                     Copyright (C) 1989 By Derrick Burgess



     Thesaur Plus is a memory resident thesaurus, it resides in memory
     until you hit a hot-key (user definable) and then Thesaur Plus pops
     up over the program you are currently running, it automatically
     looks up the word the cursor is under (if not it asks for a word to
     look for) and displays the synonyms (if the word is located).
     There are over 10,000 main words and close to 50,000 synonyms in
     this version (this is 20,000 words greater than v 1.x).  There is
     also a program that allows you to add your own words as synomyms,
     and even delete words that you think are inappropriate.

Minimum requirements for running Thesaur Plus.

     DOS 3.0 OR greater to run all the programs.
        Thesaur will run on DOS 2.0
     Hard drive with 300k free
     69k of RAM, or 10K of RAM and an additional 120k disk space

    If you do not have a Hard Drive or DOS 3.0, you can still use
    part of this disk - while you won't be able to run THESPLUS.EXE
    you will be able to run THESAUR.EXE which is the stand alone
    version of Thesaur Plus with extra features added (add and edit
    synonyms)  (Note: ThesPlus.Exe must still reside on the disk for
    the program to work)

How to Install Thesaur Plus

    Thesaur Plus should reside on your Hard Drive, so you
    will need to copy all the files from this disk to the
    subdirectory of your choice on the Hard drive.
       (Thesaur Plus does not care what drive or directory it is on,
        but all the files MUST stay together in the same directory!)

    Once you have all the files where you would like, you can then
    run CONFIG.EXE to change the Default Colors and Hot Key.

    Once you have copied the files (If you wish) and changed the
    Default Colors and HotKey (Again, If you wish) - to Load Thesaur 
    Plus into memory just run the file THESPLUS.EXE, or if you are not 
    in the current drive or directory you will have to add those too.

    If you run THESPLUS.EXE from a floppy drive, do not remove the
    disk unless Thesaur Plus is first removed from memory.  A floppy 
    system is NOT recommended for use with THESPLUS.EXE.

       The following information is provided by the Association of
       Shareware Professionals regarding problems with authors

       "This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
       Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware
       principle works for you.  If you are unable to resolve a shareware-
       related problem with an ASP member by contacting the member directly,
       ASP may be able to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a
       dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does not provide technical

       Plus one simple reminder:
          Not all synonyms have the same meaning or shade of intent.
       If the proper definition of a word or term is not known or
       not understood - LOOK IT UP.  It is very easy to use the wrong
       term instead of the proper one.


                                                 Thesaur/Plus - Page 3


     A couple of notes:
          Thesaur/Plus  refers to BOTH Thesaur Plus AND Thesaur
          Thesaur Plus  refers to ONLY Thesaur Plus
          Thesaur       refers to ONLY Thesaur


  Q>    What is Thesaur Plus?

  A>         Thesaur Plus is a pop-up Thesaurus, whenever you need
        a different word or a different shade of meaning than the
        word that comes to mind, pop-up Thesaur Plus and get just
        the word you wanted, but couldn't quite remember!


  Q>    Well then what is Thesaur? and how are they different?

  A>         Thesaur is also a thesaurus, but it is not a memory resident
        program - and you can't pop it up whenever you want.  Other than
        that Thesaur uses the same commands, and only needs DOS 2.0 and one
        floppy drive to work compared to the Plus requirements of DOS 3.0 and
        a Hard Drive.  Thesaur also adds a couple of features not found
        in Thesaur Plus.


  Q>    Are both Thesaur and Thesaur Plus easy to use?

  A>        Most Definitely!  Thesaur/Plus was designed with simplicity
        in mind.  You only need to remember your Hot-key (the key
        combination you use to pop Thesaur Plus up over what you are
        doing now) to use the Thesaur Plus, and you only need to start
        Thesaur - All available commands are shown in a menu after you
        get started!  And both programs use the same commands to make it 
        even easier! 




                                                 Thesaur/Plus - Page 4

How to Install Thesaur/Plus

    Thesaur/Plus should reside on your Hard Drive for best performance, 
    so you will need to copy all the files from this disk to the 
    subdirectory of your choice on the Hard drive. (Thesaur/Plus do not 
    care what drive or directory they are on, but all the files MUST 
    stay together in the same directory!)

     ---> Also, do not move the files around if Thesaur Plus is in memory 
           - First remove it from memory before moving the data files.)

    Once you have all the files where you would like, you can then
    run CONFIG.EXE to change the Default Colors, and Hot Key.

    Once you have copied the files (If you wish) and changed the Default 
    Colors and HotKey (Again, If you wish) - to Load Thesaur Plus into 
    memory just run the file THESPLUS.EXE, or if you are not in the 
    current drive or directory you will have to add those too. To run 
    Thesaur just run the file THESAUR.EXE.


    Once again the installation instructions are..
      1)  Copy all files on this disk to a subdirectory on your Hard
          Drive
      2)  Make that Subdirectory the Default (ex. CD C:\THESPLUS)
      3)  Run CONFIG.EXE  (Not Required)
      4)  Run THESPLUS.EXE or THESAUR.EXE



                                                  Thesaur/Plus - Page 5


HOW TO CHANGE COLORS (If using a Color Monitor)

        If you want to change the colors that Thesaur/Plus use
        then enter this command from the DOS prompt:

                   CONFIG COLORS

        Colors are changed the next time you Pop Up Thesaur Plus or
        run Thesaur.

      ->The files Config.Exe and ThesPlus.Cfg must be in the current
            directory.



HOW TO CHANGE THE HOT KEY

        To change the Hot Key for Thesaur Plus you must
             enter this command from the DOS prompt:

                   CONFIG HOTKEY

        The Hot Key is changed the next time you load Thesaur Plus
        into memory.  

      ->The files Config.Exe and ThesPlus.Cfg must be in the current
            directory


HOW TO REMOVE THESAUR PLUS FROM MEMORY

       To remove Thesaur Plus from memory you must enter
       this command from the DOS prompt:

                   THESPLUS /U


                                                 Thesaur/Plus - Page 6



HOW TO USE THESAUR PLUS

         To Load Thesaur Plus into memory, just run the THESPLUS.EXE file.
         you may need to add the proper drive and directory that the .EXE
         is in so DOS can find the program.

   NOTE: Your personal Hot Key is shown when Thesaur Plus is
         first loaded into memory, and also if you try to
         re-load Thesaur Plus into memory.

         After you hit the Hot Key, Thesaur Plus will automatically
         look for the word that the cursor is on, or the word that
         was immediately to the left of the cursor.  If the cursor
         was not on or next to a word, then you are asked for the
         word that you would like looked up.

         Now you are given a Menu of Options of what you can do next.
         These Options are discussed in detail on the following pages.

       F    Find Another Word
            If you want to start a new search for a different a word

       B    Back Track
            If you use <RET> to go to alternate word, you can use this
            command to go back to the previous word

       I    Information
            My Address for correspondence, and registration
            information.  If you are not registered to use this program
            there is a 14% chance that this screen will be shown
            upon pop-up of Thesaur Plus.

       Q    Quit
            Pop back down to underlying application

      ESC   Quit
            Pop back down to underlying application

     <RET>  Return or Enter - Display Alternate word
            The alternate word that is looked up is the word pointed
            to by the arrow key in the middle of the screen.

                To move the arrow key to the word you are interested
                in, use the Up and Down arrow keys.

       Up and Down Arrows are used for scrolling through the synonyms
       for each word.

       PgUp and PgDn keys are used to scroll to the previous/next word
       in the thesaurus.


       THESAUR includes the following commands

       A    Add a Synonym
               Add any Synonym to the main word (Synonym does not need
               to be in the database already)
               
      INS   Add a new word to the database - No Synonyms yet

       D    Delete Synonym
               Delete one of the synonyms shown (To either make room
               for a more appropriate word (max 30 syn's per word) or
               to just remove a poor choice of words on my part.

            There is no Information screen in Thesaur.

         **************************************************************
          Use of the Leading Edge Word Processor with Thesuar Plus
          
          This Applies to the 1.3 and 1.5 (at least) versions of the 
          LEWP.
          
             Load Thesaur Plus as instructed in this manual.
             
             To access Thesaur Plus, instead of just using the Hot Key,
             you must.
                1.   Press Control-Escape
                2.   Enter your HotKey
                3.   Use the program and exit.
                4.   Press Control-Escape again.
                
          Not all version of the LEWP require these steps, but some do!

        THESAUR

        THESAUR.EXE is a standalone thesaurus - it is very similar
        to Thesuar Plus, but does not become memory resident, only
        requires DOS 2.0, can be run off of a floppy system, and is
        faster than Thesaur Plus.

        The commands to use ThesEdit are the very same as Thesaur Plus,
        but there are a couple of added instructions which are:
              A)  Add a Synonym
              D)  Delete Synonym
        With these two commands you can add or delete any synonym you
        want from the database of synonyms.



        THESPLUS.MOD

        Whenever you use the commands A or D the actions that are done
        are added to a file called THESPLUS.MOD - DO NOT DELETE this file.
        This information will be used whenever you either upgrade to a
        newer version of Thesaur Plus where I provide a substantially
        better database (This way you will not have to lose all the work
        you did to customize your list), or you can send the list to me
        and I will include your changes in the next release (Preferred by
        me - that way everyone can benefit by your effort).

       ==================================================================
       | Because I would really like to get ahold of your THESPLUS.MOD  |
       | file if you make many additions to the database, I will        |
       | consider that as partial registration ($1 for every 20 words   |
       | to add to the database - up to $17 of the $20 registration if  |
       | you provide me with 340 new and accurate synonyms!)            |
       ==================================================================

        Also when you add a new synonym there is a certain amount of
        wasted space (noted in brackets in THESPLUS.MOD) in the database
        this is only on the order of 25 or so bytes for each synonym
        added, but it is using unneeded space - To reclaim this space 
        use REINDEX.EXE
