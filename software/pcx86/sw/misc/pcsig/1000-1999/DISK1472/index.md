## Information about "THE MUSIC MINDER"

    THE MUSIC MINDER is a comprehensive music library management system.
    Schools, churches, civic organizations and individuals use it to keep
    track of music orders, music library inventory and performances.
    
    Compositions in your music library are posted through the library
    system
    with all data concerning the composition available for editing.  The
    library is displayed and various reports can be run against the
    database.  Performance data can be posted and maintained, allowing the
    music director to view the performance history (three previous
    performances) for any composition.  THE MUSIC MINDER also supports
    multiple music libraries.
    
    Some of the features provided are:  a music library filing system,
    complete ordering information system, individual 3x5 library card
    printing, performance tracking, establishment of multiple libraries,
    performance history reports, and other reports based on composer,
    keywords and title.  Browse the library by keyword, composer or title.
    This program is fully menu-driven and easy to operate.
