## Information about "THE SPORTS STATBOOK 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1427)"

    If you're in charge of tracking stats for hockey, soccer, volleyball or
    other team sports, STATBOOK will significantly reduce the time and
    effort you spend.  Appropriate for pro, semipro, high school, college
    and company-sponsored teams, it automatically tracks and provides year-
    to-date and/or historical player statistics.  This software is
    currently used by such teams as Hockey Central of Philadelphia and the
    LA Kings.  The documentation is extensive and helpful.
