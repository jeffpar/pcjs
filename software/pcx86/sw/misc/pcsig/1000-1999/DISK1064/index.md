## Information about "MAIL IT!"

    Print mailing labels without investing in an expensive or hard-to-learn
    database program.  With point-and-click menus, it's perfect for small
    businesses, churches, interest groups, etc.
    
    MAIL IT is flexible enough for most mailing needs.  It lets you enter up
    to 1,000 individual records and search most fields for information to be
    printed.  Several label-printing options are offered, but label
    printing
    is limited to single-column labels.  And, there's even a help file of
    state abbreviations.
