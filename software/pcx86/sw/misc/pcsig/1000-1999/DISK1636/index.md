## Information about "TWODISKS"

    TWODISKS is a program for comparing and updating files on two separate
    disks or directories. Both directories can then be shown, and you may
    automatically copy or move files between the two directories. By
    selectively picking the individual files that are to be copied, moved or
    deleted, you may operate on whole groups of files at once.
    
    When viewing the files that are on each directory, the files that are
    identical will be displayed on the same screen. If the files have the
    same name but different dates, the newer files will be displayed on the
    list for the directory where it is located. These files then may be
    copied easily or moved to the other directory being compared.  Files
    that are not found on the other directory will be displayed on a
    separate list. Thus TWODISKS separates the files into three groups:
    those files that are identical, those files that have the same name but
    different dates, and those files that are completely different.
    TWODISKS will make it much easier to compare and update directories on
    both floppies and hard disks.
