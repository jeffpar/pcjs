## Information about "TMAKER"

    Teachers, teacher's aides, and parents -- TMAKER is here to help you at
    test time.  Tell TMAKER the subject and how many questions should be in
    the test and stand back!  Produce a quiz for the fourth period civics
    class and a quiz for the sixth period class, cover the same material and
    yet, have two different tests.  Someone miss a test?  Generate one for
    him to take as make-up.  No need to worry if people have been comparing
    notes.
    
    Create a database of up to 200 questions and answers in each file with
    as many files as you have the memory to support.  You don't have to
    enter them all at once.  As you create test questions and answers, put
    them in the database.  The next time you create a test in that subject,
    enter any new questions and answers into the same database.
    
    Tests can be printed and taken in a group or the computer can run a
    single test for a student.  This one-on-one version is also good for
    tutorials and can be used by the students to create personalized study
    guides. (Optional password protection keeps private information
    private.)  Exact answers are required for the computer-driven option so
    it's ideal for questions with exact answers such as names, dates,
    numbers, yes or no, multiple choice and fill-the-blanks.
    
    The software is menu-driven, has a full help function and requires no
    special computer expertise to operate.
