## Information about "APPTRACKER"

    Keep track of all of your appointments whether they're this afternoon,
    next month or next year.  Clean, crisp screens and a direct, effective
    approach make this datebook a pleasure to use.
    
    All of your commitments are available from one screen, with on-line help
    a key-stroke away.  Save all of your datebooks for record-keeping and
    instant retrieval.  Never miss another appointment because you "forgot."
