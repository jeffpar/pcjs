## Information about "SPRINGER"

    SPRINGER offers the beginning to intermediate chess player 10 levels of
    difficulty and plenty of options.
    
    You can play against the computer, watch the computer play against
    itself, or play against another player while SPRINGER watches for
    illegal moves.  You can take back a move you made, swap sides, and even
    interrupt the computer's thinking to force it to make a move.  The
    maximum time SPRINGER takes to make a move varies from one second to a
    little over three minutes, depending on what level you are playing and
    your type of computer.
    
    For games that are saved on-disk, SPRINGER can do an instant replay of
    the entire game or let you replay each individual move one at a time.
    It also prints a list of moves for each chess game, or prints a graphic
    display of the chess board at any time in the game.  You select and move
    pieces with the cursor pad.  On-line help is available for all options.
    You can play on either color or monochrome systems.
