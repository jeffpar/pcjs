## Information about "PC-PROJECT 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1341)"

    PC-PROJECT lets you organize and control complex projects.  It uses the
    critical path method to produce a project schedule displayed in the form
    of a Gantt chart.  It is designed to help you manage complex jobs so you
    can finish them on time and under budget.
    
    PC-PROJECT views a project as a group of tasks or activities.  When you
    supply the estimated duration of each task and the relationships between
    the tasks (the predecessor tasks and successor tasks), it automatically
    calculates a schedule for you and displays it as a Gantt chart.  With
    the chart, you can see when each task should begin and end, the current
    status of each task and whether or not the task is on the critical path.
    Like a spreadsheet, PC-Project can immediately show you how any change
    alters the project's finish date and cost.  This allows you to try
    repeated what-if scenarios until you have reached the optimal project
    schedule.
    
    PC-Project also has a resource worksheet to track payroll,supplies, and
    equipment costs.  The worksheet allows you to list your employees and
    equipment and assign them to tasks, so you can coordinate your resources
    efficiently.  The resource worksheet tracks costs to date, anticipated
    costs, final cost, and cashflow.
    
    The program is completely menu-driven and contains excellent on-line
    help, plus a detailed 75+ page on-disk manual.  If you are moderately
    familiar with project management and critical path method, you will be
    able to use this program with relative ease.  It is written in C for
    increased speed.
