## Information about "CMPCALC3"

    CMPCALC3 converts your PC into a programmable calculator for complex
    numbers. Using reverse Polish notation (RPN), like Hewlett-Packard
    calculators, complex numbers and functions become as easy to handle as
    real ones.
    
    CMPCALC3 provides the arithmetical functions of addition, subtraction,
    multiplication and division, as well as the more complex exponential,
    logarithmic, trigonometric, hyperbolic, and square root functions. It
    has nine labeled storage areas, which are shown on the screen, and 41
    numbered storage areas, which are not. CMPCALC3 can memorize programs
