## Information about "LEOCE TOOLKIT & PC-ENCRYPT"

    Bring UNIX functionality to MS-DOS with the LEOCE TOOLKIT, a
    collection of utilities complete with textbook quality C source code
    that beginner programmers will find highly useful.
    
    ~ DLT.COM -- Routine to permit deleting of multiple files without
    wildcards (like UNIX RM command).
    
    ~ ENTAB.COM -- Converts spaces in files to tabs according to options
    specified or default processing using 8 spaces per tab.
    
    ~ HEAD.COM -- The UNIX HEAD command reads a number of lines (20 default)
    from the start of a file and writes them to the screen.
    
    ~ MERGE.COM -- Routine will read the .A output from the Turbo C compiler
    and read the .C source, and merge the two. This is useful to see how
    the compiler has translated individual code segments.
    
    ~ PR.COM -- The UNIX PR function generates formatted print files with
    carriage returns to a file or the printer.
    
    ~ SIZEOF.COM -- The UNIX SIZEOF routine counts the number of bytes in a
    file.
    
    ~ STGMAP.COM -- Traces through memory reporting the names and sizes of
    hooked vectors for all active load modules in memory. This is useful to
    determine if virus programs or renegade TSR programs are present.
    
    ~ TAIL.COM -- The UNIX TAIL function reads n (20 default) lines from the
    bottom of a file onto the screen.
    
    ~ TEE.COM -- The UNIX TEE function will copy a file both to the screen
    and to a designated file (with optional redirection for input an
    output). This is commonly called a FILTER function.
    
    ~ TP.COM -- Routine to replace the DOS TYPE command. This function
    will type a file onto the screen. There are a number of options
    supported to control output, such as tp/p file file file... files are
    output one group at a time followed by the " -More- " prompt.
    
    ~ WILD.C = C Source for supporting file wildcard processing in a C
    program.
    
    ~ CMDLINE.C -- C source for supporting command line switch processing.
    
    PC-ENCRYPT keeps unauthorized users from peeking at your files!
    
    Whether you work in a profession where you are required to keep
    information about clients or projects confidential, or you just want a
    little more privacy for that computerized diary of yours, PC-ENCRYPT
    puts a zipper on your files that only you can open.
    
    The program accepts a password key of up to 255 characters, including
    spaces, and then makes an encrypted copy of a designated file.  The
    copy cannot be decoded, without a supercomputer, unless it is
    decrypted by PC-ENCRYPT with the appropriate password.
    
    Also includes HEXDUMP that translates a file into hexadecimal numbers
    and displays them page-by-page.
