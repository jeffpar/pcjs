## Information about "DIRECTMAINT"

    A pox on DOS! If you believe that DOS file and directory commands were
    designed by demented hackers, you'll appreciate the simple, sane
    approach of DIRECT MAINT. Now you need not remember those obscure DOS
    commands. You can ignore paths and leave the DOS manual under one leg
    of your printer table. Instead, use a friendly highlighted bounce bar
    to decide what you want to do. If the program needs to know
    something, it will ask you. Works great on hard and floppy disks.
    
    Load and run programs and batch files using the point-and-shoot menu.
    Easily find, copy, compare, erase, display, print, and change names,
    dates, times, and attributes of files. DIRECT MAINT copies all or
    selected files wherever you desire. You are prompted when target disks
    are full, so you'll never split files between disks. Physically move
    files wherever you want. Comparing old and new files is a snap. Erase
    multiple tagged files or whole directories, and print
    subdirectory names in a single directory or tree structure. View two
    disks or two directories on the same disk at the same time.
