## Information about "HANGMAN BY VICTOR"

    Remember all the fun times you had trying to stump your friends playing
    hangman?  Now, with Victor Mux's new computerized version of HANGMAN,
    you can test your own knowledge of music, science, computers and much
    more as you try to escape the fate of the gallows.
    
    You can either use the keyboard or a mouse to play the game.  HANGMAN
    can be played by 1 to 4 players, and follows the standard rules which we
    all have come to know over the years.  Pick your letters one at a time,
    trying to keep body parts from appearing under the noose.  Once the word
    is either discovered or missed, a small definition/description appears,
    providing the user with some background for the solution.  Easy to play
    and simple to use, HANGMAN can provide hours of enjoyment for "children"
    of all ages.
    
    In addition, you can create your own libraries.  The program is able to
    contain 500 libraries and each library can contain 500 words.  If a
    child is having difficulty in a particular area in school, you could
    use this program to help him with spelling and guessing words within a
    specific subject.
    
    HANGMAN is a wonderfully easy and fun program which can be used by the
    whole family!
