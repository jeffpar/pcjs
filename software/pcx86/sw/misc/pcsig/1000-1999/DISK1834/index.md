## Information about "AT-SLOW/LOADKEY/HANDY DANDY UTILITIES"

    Sometimes your speedy AT has a little too much speed for a game or older
    application you may want to run.  AT-SLOW is your solution.  This easy-
    to-use program will pull back the reins on your AT or 386 without any
    hardware modification -- even if the original manufacturer only intended
    the machine to run at top speeds.
    
    AT-SLOW uses the high resolution timer found in a PC-AT or close clone
    to slow down games and other programs which run too fast on PC-ATs.
    Your machine can run at almost any slower speed thanks to a variable
    startup command.  Play around with different speeds until you find a
    speed that keeps both you and your computer happy.  AT-SLOW can also be
    turned off or set to a different speed without rebooting your machine.
    
    LOADKEY is a utility for batch files that allows you to customize and
    accelerate the execution of an application program by preloading a
    string of key strokes to the BIOS keyboard buffer.
    
    LOADKEY operates in two modes -- direct entry and hot key.  In direct
    entry, you can invoke LOADKEY in a batch file by supplying a string of
    key strokes as a parameter to the call.  When the batch file is run,
    LOADKEY executes and preloads the keyboard buffer.  LOADKEY then
    terminates and the batch file now loads the application program.  When
    input is requested by the program, it is immediately obtained from the
    keyboard buffer.  In the hot key mode, LOADKEY allows you to assign an
    ASCII code to the entire string.  This code can be used later to replace
    the batch parameter(%n) in the batch file.
    
    LOADKEY limits the strings to 15 key strokes and only accommodates 80
    individual strings.
    
    HANDY DANDY UTILITIES offers you a no-fuss alternative to learning
    complicated utility programs or frustrating DOS commands. This easy to
    learn set of file management utilities offers an uncomplicated approach
    to commonly used batch file and DOS commands.
    
    ~ MOV -- Moves files between subdirectories. A command DOS has long
    been lacking.
    
    ~ CSR -- Hides and unhides the cursor. Useful in batch file creation.
    
    ~ SEEMORE -- Displays text files to screen a page at a time.

    cursor through diagram to select a directory to change to. Press
    return and you are automatically placed in that directory.
    
    ~ FF -- Causes printer to formfeed. Use in batch files or just to save
    trips to the printer.
    
    ~ BOOT -- Warm boots your computer. Convenient in batch file creation.
    
    ~ CHOOSE -- Allows multiple user choices in batch files.
