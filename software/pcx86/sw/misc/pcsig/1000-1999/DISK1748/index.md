## Information about "VECHILE EXPENSES AND MAINTENANCE"

    VEHICLE EXPENSES provides a means of writing, storing and maintaining
    files of four categories: fuel, scheduled, emergency, and other
    expenses related to the operation and maintenance of motor vehicles or
    other equipment.
    
    Using VEHICLE EXPENSES is quite easy. The database is created by simply
    assigning a file name and adding the appropriate information. While the
    system is set to handle many different vehicles, it is best suited for
    the individual or small business with only a few cars.
    
    VEHICLE MAINTENANCE provides a typewritten check-off sheet listing items
    to be serviced at pre-defined intervals. The check-off sheet may be
    used as a "memory jogger" to prevent overlooking items that should be
    maintained, or the sheet may be presented to a service agency in order
    to indicate the work you would like them to accomplish.
    
    The data base is created by inputting up to five (5) maintenance
    intervals; i.e., 5000, 10000, 15000, 30000, and 60000 "miles" for
    vehicles, or you may use "hours" as the maintenance period criteria for
    items such as generators, snowmobiles, air compressors, etc. The
    maintenance period criteria is followed by a description of the
    maintenance items you would like serviced at each of the specified
    intervals; i.e., change oil, replace oil filter, replace air filter,
    check brake pads, etc. Any of the interval item descriptions may be
    added to, deleted from, or edited as required without leaving the
    program.
