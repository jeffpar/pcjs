## Information about "BATTLE GROUND & ARIONX: SEEKER OF GANS"

    BATTLE GROUND is a World War II field-combat game/simulator for two
    players.
    
    Each player is the general of either the U.S. or German army commanding
    16 privates with various weapons, two medics, one sergeant, and a
    major.  These men have varying abilities that often come in handy while
    engaging in hand-to-hand combat.  Each soldier carries hand grenades,
    adding even greater realism to this war simulation.
    
    At the beginning of the game, the players select the battlefield on
    which to compete.  There are five different battlefields to choose from.
    As the battle begins, you start in separate corners and come out
    fighting.  All troops are represented by small squares.  Both players
    take turns moving, firing, and whatever other strategy they think of.  A
    great feature is each player can do as much as he wants on any one
    turn, adding even more realism to the game of war.
    
    Light on graphics but heavy on challenge, ARIONX: SEEKER OF GANS is the
    third in a six-part game series for math wizards.
    
    If you love cryptographics, logic, math puzzles, and code-cracking,
    then you'll probably enjoy all six games in this series.  Each game
    should be tackled and solved in consecutive order, as the preceding
    games' correct answers are required somewhere in the current game to
    arrive at the correct answer.  However, it is possible to play each
    separately.
