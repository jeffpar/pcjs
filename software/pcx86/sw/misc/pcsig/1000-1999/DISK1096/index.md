## Information about "KB0ZP SUPER CONTEST LOG"

    KB0ZP CONTEST LOG is an amateur radio contest logging program to help
    the radio operator log contest information in a suitable form for
    submission for awards.  After entering the other station's call sign,
    you have the option of entering two more pieces of information (RST,
    Section, Grid Square, etc.).  The CONTEST LOG takes over from there.
    
    It dupes, calculates your score, and saves to disk or printer or both.
    The main screen shows date and time, name of contest, your station call
    sign, grand total number of contacts made by mode and band, elapsed time
    from last contact, total accumulated score, and the amount of free space
    available in RAM.  Up to 4000 contacts can be made.  Help screens show
    usable frequencies by band, class of license, and section
    abbreviations.  All contacts can be listed on the screen during the
    contest for viewing and correcting.  A "hurry up timer" can be set to
    time your contacts.  The arithmetic for automatic scoring can be changed
    to suit the contest.
    
    KB0ZP CONTEST LOG print program prints a list of the contacts made in
    almost any form you want, for submission for awards.  It is to be used
    after the contest and at your leisure.
