## Information about "DIRUTILS"

    Here is a collection of directory-related programs that will excite you.
    ADVOCATE SCOUT is a "file finder" with features such as simultaneous
    multiple searches and path-specific searching. Now you can find files
    if you know virtually anything about them -- any part of the name,
    something like it, or just its approximate date. Comes complete with
    batch files to automate your most frequent searches. For example,
    simply type "TODAY" for all of today's files.
    
    ADVOCATE DIR masquerades as a typical, modern DIR replacement, but when
    you want to compare several directories or sets of files, up to four can
    be displayed side by side as easily as one.
    
    ADVOCATE TREE is the useful TREE replacement you've waited for. Far
    more informative than TREE, it includes size of directory and percentage
    of the drive it occupies, and operates at twice the speed.
    
    CDX is a fast way to change directories with a single command. It also
    changes simultaneously drives and directories with one three-stroke
    command. All utilities work great within menus, but they're especially
    powerful for the command-line user.
