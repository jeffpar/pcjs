## Information about "BTU ANALYSIS"

    Now you do-it-yourself handypersons can figure out which heating or
    cooling system is best for your home.  A properly sized furnace or air
    conditioner is essential for efficient temperature control.  BTU
    ANALYSIS puts the brain power of heating and cooling professionals to
    work for you.
    
    This program, while useful for professionals, is especially helpful to
    those who know very little about BTU analysis.  Self prompting pop-up
    help screens, on-line instructions, and complete explanations help you
    build an accurate picture of your home.  "Worst case" methodology is
    used in analyzing your heating and cooling needs.
