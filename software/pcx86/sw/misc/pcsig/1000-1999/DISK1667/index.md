## Information about "RESUME SHOP"

    Take advantage of menu-driven help in doing that pesky but
    absolutely vital job of getting together a credible, attractive,
    and persuasive resume.  RESUME SHOP prompts you to enter every item you
    need to construct your resume, including your name, address,
    job objective, education, work experience and references.  The
    result is a concise, one page presentation of your background and
    credentials.  The bottom line is that an adequate resume can be put
    together quickly and customized versions easily created to send to each
    prospective employer.  A fourteen-page user guide offers
    advice on improving your resume writing skills.  The program even
    includes a sample cover letter to be mailed with the resume.
