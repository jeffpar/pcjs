## Information about "FAST INVOICE WRITER"

    FAST INVOICE WRITER is just what the small businessman ordered.  A
    winner for everyone from landlords to health professionals!
    
    This program provides invoices, purchase orders, requisitions, or any
    document similar in format to an invoice. Compute taxes or bill by the
    hour -- the program does all the calculations.
    
    It produces a numbered, professional-looking document in about 60
    seconds and prints as many copies as you want. Then it prints your
    mailing labels and inserts for 10-inch window envelopes. It also prints
    your firm's name, address, and phone number on the invoice in large
    letters and handles taxes and shipping charges. It also contains a
    customer database routine and cashbook file for printing periodic
    summaries.
