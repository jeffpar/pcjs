## Information about "TURBO APPRENTICE"

    With TURBO APPRENTICE, the built-in help for Turbo Pascal can be
    appended to include prototypes and descriptions of your own functions,
    procedures and units.  TAP puts references to any routine you've written
    one keystroke away.  It will build its index without any changes in
    source code.  TAP can store up to 46 lines of information for each entry
    and can even cross reference.
    
    TAP is an excellent tool for any programmer who has a sizeable number of
    routines to remember.

    TAP      EXE  Main program.
