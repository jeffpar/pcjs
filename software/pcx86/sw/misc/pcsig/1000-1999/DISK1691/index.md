## Information about "CREATIVE CHAOS"

    CREATIVE CHAOS is made for those whose ideas are too predictable and
    whose minds are too logical. To enhance creativity, CREATIVE CHAOS uses
    random selection to help you create short stories, juggle menus, tell
    fortunes, generate silly phrases and funny nonsense sentences. But most
    of all, CREATIVE CHAOS can stimulate your imagination, help you create
    inventions, artwork, games, or engage in incredibly obtuse mental
    gymnastics.
    
    Instead of deductive thinking, CREATIVE CHAOS stimulates intuitive
    thinking. The fundamental idea behind CREATIVE CHAOS is to use random
    selection in a very structured way to juggle lists of ideas, chores, and
    anything you can list.  Sometimes the results are hilarious, other times
    they contain a real germ for change. And, sometimes they are plain old
    silly.
