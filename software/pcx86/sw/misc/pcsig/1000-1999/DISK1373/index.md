## Information about "THE PRICEBOOK 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1374)"

    employees can instantly know what you are paying for any of the hundreds
    to thousands of items you carry. It also generates price quotes,
    acknowledgements, purchase orders and invoices. Each of these forms
    will have the prices automatically entered, extended and totaled,
