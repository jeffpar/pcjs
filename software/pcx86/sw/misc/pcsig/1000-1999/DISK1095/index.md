## Information about "SBW 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1094)"

    SYSTEM FOR BUSINESS AND THE WORKPLACE (SBW) is a multifaceted
    integrated system that meets many common business needs. The system has
    five different functions and a separate module for each: customer
    information system, human resource (personnel) management, accounting,
    inventory, and production system. It also has an extensive
    documentation manual covering all five modules. The system is written
    in dBase III+ and you will need dBase III+ to run it. Also included is
    the DBase source code.
    
    The customer file lets you maintain a complete customer database
    including purchase information and demographics about the customer. You
    can even print mailing labels or generate form letters. With the human
    resources management portion of the system you can maintain detailed
    personnel records on your employees. Previous employment history,
    personnel reports, and payroll are all supported. The accounting system
    is also designed for the small business. It handles both accounts
    payable and receivable. It maintains your chart of accounts and
    posts all expenses and income. Inventory management is for either
    manufactured goods or raw materials.

Smith Bike Works Business System
--------------------------------

The disk labeled Smith Bike Works Project Disk is an integrated business
application using dBASE III Plus that is described and documented
in Chapters 6 through 11 of the text.  The five modules that compose
Smith Bike Works include:
         -Customer Information Systems
         -Human Resource Management
         -Accounting
         -Inventory Management & Order Processing
         -Production Planning & Operations

To run the System, you need to have the dbase disk in drive A and in
drive B the project disk.  At the dot prompt of dBASE (.) type:
         DO SYSMENU and press RETURN.

USER MANUAL
------------

The User & Programmer Manual describes Smith Bike Works in detail.
The user portion presents a step by step execution of the system
using the same data files that are on the project disk.  The
students first execute the system with the aid of the manual and
answer the questions as they go along.

Since the manual displays all the screens of the system, you can
easily review Smith Bike Works without having a computer in the
classroom.  The students can take notes in the manual itself.
Throughout the manual, questions are included assessing the
students' understanding of the system, data base design techniques,
and the dBASE programming language.  Answers to these questions are
available at the end of the manual.  These questions can be
assigned for homework or for in-class exercises and discussion.

A portion of the user manual is on this disk on the file called
USER.DOC.

The manual has a table of contents and a sample portion follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------
                    T A B L E   O F   C O N T E N T S

         2.1.7. RETURNING TO SYSMENU.................................2-41


There is a summary list of all questions that appeared in the
manual that can be used as review questions as the following:
---------------------------------------------------------------
                    L I S T   O F   Q U E S T I O N S

 2-1: Why do you want to type dbase at A>?.................................2-2
 2-2: Why must a second disk be inserted?..................................2-2
 2-3: Why must you type DO SYSMENU?........................................2-3

 2-5: What does the customer file maintenance do?..........................2-5
 2-6: What does the Find command do?.......................................2-6
 2-7: Why must you type Ctrl-Y?............................................2-7

Look at the screen, and find the "Activity Menu".

To me, it shows that the computer (defaults and/or) expects me to
enter a choice between A and F.

Next, I want to type A, because I want to load the customer information
system.

TYPE:  A

AND THE SYSTEM WILL:  Activate the Customer Information System.

Numbered Open-ended Questions are throughout the text as follows:

Q&A 1-4: How do you load the Customer Information System?



Programmer Manual
------------------

Before students make changes or enhancements to a system, they first
need to understand it.  Therefore, the programmer's manual includes:
    -flowcharts at the system and modular level,
    -program descriptions within the five modules,
    -program calls pointing to subsequent executions, and
    -data dictionaries describing all fields and variables.
Students can use these as guides as they enhance this existing system
and/or as they develop their documentation for their own programs.
