## Information about "COMPUTER SOLITAIRE"

    The government should put COMPUTER SOLITAIRE on its list of addictive
    substances.  The three games offer the compulsive obsessive card dealer
    all the variety and challenge you can handle.  SPIDER is a tricky deal,
    the nearest thing to a solitaire strategy and skill game.  Played with
    two decks, it's easy to learn but hard to master.  You'll recognize
    KLONDIKE, today's most popular solitaire game.  But you'll be taunted by
    three skill levels and a unique scoring system.  CANFIELD, a voice from
    Saratoga's past, will haunt you.  Originally, you bought a deck for $50
    and got $5 for every card played in the field.

The solitaire programs on this disk are described below:                 
                                                                         
SPIDER - Unlike many solitaire games, good strategy and skillful play are
     more important than good luck in winning the game of Spider.  This  
     game is played with two decks of cards which are easily manipulated 
     on the computer screen.  Spider is easy to learn but difficult to   
     master.  This game is entertaining, challenging, and addictive.     
                                                                         
KLONDIKE - This is probably today's most popular solitaire game and is   
     known by many different names including Fascination, Demon, and     
     Small Triangle.  Three levels of difficulty are available and a     
     unique scoring system has been added to accurately reflect how well 
     each game is played.                                                
                                                                         
CANFIELD - This game was made famous by the owner of a Saratoga gambling 
     saloon in the 1890's.  Mr. Canfield sold a deck of cards for $50 and
     then paid the player $5 for every card he played to the field.  Our 
     computerized version gives you the chance to see if you could have  
     beaten Mr. Canfield at his own game.                                
                                                                         
This program has the following features:                                 
                                                                         
     - A custom designed graphics set which clearly shows the games on   
       the screen.  The poorly formed ASCII characters are not used.     
     - The games are played by using the cursor keys to point and the    
       function keys to execute the desired action.                      
     - You can choose from 48 different screen color combinations.       
     - All of the games have complex scoring algorithms which accurately 
       evaluate how well a game has been played even if it is not won.   
     - On-line help is available at all times.                           
     - Complete error trapping and automatic error messages if desired.  
     - Multiple levels of difficulty.                                    
     - A complete instruction manual.
