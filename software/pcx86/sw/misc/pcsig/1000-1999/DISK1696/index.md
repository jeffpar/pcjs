## Information about "MEMBERSHIP LIST"

    MEMBERSHIP LIST AND MAIL LABEL PROGRAM will keep track of the members of
    any club and will print out address labels.  Each member record
    includes
    name, address, home and work phone number, whether or not dues are paid,
    the date when the dues are up, and the committee the member belongs to.
    Each record may be edited, viewed, searched for, or deleted.  The
    program can print the addresses on mail labels (single and multiple),
    mail envelopes or folders, cards or large labels, or customized labels.
    MEMBERSHIP LIST AND MAIL LABEL PROGRAM allows you to print the address
    records by any field of information, including by a particular date fees
    are due.  You may also print the addresses by selected members or by
    members sorted according to those who have paid their fees and those who
    have not paid their fees.
