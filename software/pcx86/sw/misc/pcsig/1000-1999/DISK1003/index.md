## Information about "PROFILE 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1002)"

    PROFILE is a database that stores important names, addresses and phone
    numbers. Print labels and reports with several sorts, including
    third-class bulk mail. Labels can be printed up to four across and can
    be processed according to 15 pre-defined set-ups and a custom
    configuration.
    
    The reports function can perform customized column calculations such as
    running balances, percentages, spreadsheet formulas, scientific
    calculations, etc. Summarize columns and have invisible columns for
    intermediate calculations. Each report can be up to 64 columns or 255
    characters wide.
    
    PROFILE has a mail merge function compatible with WordStar, DEC WPS,
    WordPerfect, Multimate, and PC-Write. ASCII data can be imported or
    exported in several formats. Use dBase II/III/III+. Your files can be
    converted to PROFILE format. PROFILE can manage large databases with
    its powerful search capabilities.
    
    All commands use pop-up and Lotus-style menus for ease of use.
