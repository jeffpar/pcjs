## Information about "ZOOMRACKS SMALL BUSINESS KIT"

    Whether you find accounting procedures confusing or, on the contrary,
    are an accounting professional but would like to save time and effort,
    the SMALL BUSINESS KIT, used as a template to ZOOMRACKS, may be the
    answer.
    
    This is a strong general accounting package that has built itself
    around the advantages of ZOOMRACKS, the award winning "rack and
    card"
    database.

    cash journal and check register.  Each template comes with field
