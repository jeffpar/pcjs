## Information about "KING JAMES BIBLE SEARCH (1654-1657 ALSO)"

    If you're looking for a better way to find Bible references, this
    program can be your computer Bible concordance. It will search for a
    single word or a combination of words, then display a list of verses
    that contain all of those words. Best of all, you don't need the entire
    Bible on-disk to work it. However, if you have a copy of the King James
    Bible on disk, then this search program will also display the actual
    verses and put them in a text file.
    
    You can do multiple word searches, search for specific verses, even copy
    the selected verses into your wordprocessor for editing or inclusion
    into a document you're preparing. Utility programs are included to
    allow you to build your own concordance from any English version Bible
    you may have on disk. This program will prove invaluable for anyone who
    does Bible studies -- preachers, teachers, Bible study leaders, and many
    people who study for their own enrichment. Note: this product does not
    include the Bible, which is on PC-SIG disks #'s 766-772.
