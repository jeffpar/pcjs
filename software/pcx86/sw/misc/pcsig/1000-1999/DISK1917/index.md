## Information about "TOTAL RECALL"

    If you've ever had to study a foreign language or memorize a lot of
    words, terms, phrases, facts, acronyms, formulas, or dates, you've
    probably had to do it the hard way.  You've enlisted unwilling friends
    to flash index cards at you, or test you until you became friendless.
    Wouldn't it be nice if there were a better way to memorize?  Now
    there is with TOTAL RECALL.
    
    TOTAL RECALL is a complete, computerized learning environment designed
    to help adults learn and memorize almost any subject.  TOTAL RECALL is
    not a game or a children's educational program, but a powerful learning
    tool.
    
    You enter everything you need to learn or memorize into TOTAL RECALL.
    It then helps you drill, review, and test on the material quickly and
    effortlessly.  TOTAL RECALL automatically keeps track of where your
    weaknesses are and gives you the most practice in those areas, thus
    saving you hours of time and work.  It helps you organize and manage
    your learning, too:  you can print, edit, add, copy, merge, etc.
    Multiple users can study multiple subjects.  In this shareware version,
    files are limited to 50 entries but you may keep as many files as disk
    space will allow.
    
    Use TOTAL RECALL to study any subject where you have to learn or
    memorize terms, words, ideas, concepts, names, places, or dates.  It may
    even help you raise your scores on the GRE, LSAT, GMAT, SAT, or ACT.
    Information and quizzes included are:  states and capitals, English
    vocabulary, computer terms, and U.S. presidents.
