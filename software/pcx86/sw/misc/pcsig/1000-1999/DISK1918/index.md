## Information about "EDITRAND"

    Browse and edit random files produced by any program, regardless of
    record structure.  EDITRAND can be used to analyze random data in ways
    not possible using the program that created the data.  Data can be
    viewed exactly as it exists on disk, allowing speedy verification of
    program output and intelligent troubleshooting of problem situations.
    EDITRAND is intended for programmers or other persons with intimate
    knowledge of DOS files and random files in particular.
    
    Avoid long hours of testing; use EDITRAND to peek at those random files
    and find the exact fields and records that are suspected of being
    corrupt or invalid.  Have you found that an application will not allow a
    change that is desired?  Load the data file into EDITRAND, swiftly make
    the desired changes, and put the data back into operation without a
    lengthy waiting period.
    
    EDITRAND offers many features including full text, hexidecimal, and
    ASCII data editing; cursor key navigation just like ordinary text
    editors; standard editing functions such as search, replace, word count,
    cut and paste; full featured binary number operations, based on IEEE
    (the default) and Microsoft binary formats (for BASIC programers);
    undo/undelete changes to records; works on files of unlimited size;
    works on random files created by any language.
