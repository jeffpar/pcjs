## Information about "HOME BUDGET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"

    Financial record-keeping, a desirable and enlightening habit to get
    into, is usually a dreaded task and a prime target for procrastination.
    HBMS was created to make it as painless as possible.
    
    HBMS is a double-entry ledger system that helps you set up a chart of
    accounts (such as rent, medical costs, clients, professional services,
    bank interest, office expenses, etc.) into which you post (record) all
    your expenses, income, assets and liabilities. At any time,
    particularly when figuring taxes, you can see your complete financial
    position, readily viewed on screen or printed in a variety of useful
    reports.
    
    Daily financial transactions can be posted to as many as 254 accounts to
    generate monthly and yearly reports showing totals broken down by those
    categories. For instance, how much you spent on auto repair. You pick
    the codes (of one to four letters) for the various accounts, so it is
    relatively easy to remember them when posting entries without having to
    look up numbers, as is required by some ledger systems.
    
    HBMS provides a budgeting function, easy editing for incorrect entries,
    checkbook balancing, and check printing. It can handle 12 separate
    checking accounts and up to 1140 transactions per month.
