## Information about "EZ-CRYPT-LITE"

    If file privacy and security is a priority, EZ-CRYPT-LITE is a powerful
    encryption/decryption package that anyone can use.  EZ-CRYPT-LITE will
    encrypt a source file using any one of several methods, and only decrypt
    the file using a confidential key.  And do it all without cryptic
    commands!
    
    Ideal for use with electronic information services and almost any type
    of file transfer (both electronic and mail service).  Extensive menus,
    on-line manual, and context-sensitive help make it easy to use.  And if
    you want file statistics to determine how well your file is encrypted
    (frequency/distribution, mode, mean, median, and more) they are
    available from within EZ-CRYPT-LITE.  There is even a "file wipe"
    option to completely erase all traces of your file after deletion.
