## Information about "DABUTIL, EZDO, CAPP, AND EASYDOS"

    DABUTIL offers hard disk users a half-dozen valuable utilities to help
    them maintain their files and disks.
    
    A list directory command lists directories on any drive showing the
    number of files and the sum of their file sizes including hidden files.
    The find file utility lists all the occurrences of a file and the
    directories in which it is found. Disk information lists a variety of
    information about diskettes and fixed disks. It shows sector size,
    track size, cluster size, FAT, and root directory.
    
    EZDO (Easy Disk Operations) is a file and directory utility that
    gives you additional capabilities to DOS.
    
    With EZDO, you can sort the files within the present directory, find a
    file in the directory, change a file's attributes and mark a group of
    files to perform a certain operation. You can copy, delete, rename,
    change directories, and make directories. The screen display can be
    saved to a disk file. EZDO can invoke other programs to edit, view, and
    print a file. A general purpose user-definable program may also be
    invoked on any selected file.
    
    CAPP (C and Pascal Print and Check) helps you find errors in your C or
    Pascal program by printing a formatted output of the source code.  This
    output contains visual aids that include source lines, blocks, comments,
    and possible errors.  Nine simple semantic error checks are made, some
    intended to bring to your attention programming situations that may give
    you unintended results.  The error file contains the line number of
    source lines which have an error or a probable error.
    
    EASYDOS provides an easy-to-use menu for performing simple DOS
    operations.  You do not have to know the complicated DOS syntax or
    command line parameters.
    
    Select the letter of your choice on the menu to copy, erase, and rename
    files.  Get a directory of a disk to view the files it contains.
    Change your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files on your boot-up disk.
    View each file and either change it or leave it as it is.  An on-line
    help function explains in detail each menu option in the program, and
    is very useful for DOS novices.
