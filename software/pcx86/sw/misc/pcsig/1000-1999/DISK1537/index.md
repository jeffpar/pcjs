## Information about "PROCON UTILITIES"

    PROCON UTILITIES is a handy collection of memory resident utilities
    from Down Under -- Australia that is!
    
    ~ BLANKS -- Automatically blanks the screen after 1 to 9 minutes
    of no keyboard or screen activity to preserve your monitor.  Works with
    Mono/Hercules and CGA.
    
    ~ HERCULES -- Permits CGA graphics on a PC with a Hercules card.
    Works with many programs, including PC-PAINT, PRINTMASTER, and FLIGHT
    SIMULATOR (minus the Esc screen)!
    
    ~ CLOCKON -- A memory resident on-screen clock that works in all
    CGA modes and can be turned on and off from the key board.
    
    ~ CLOCKSET, CLOCKGET, SETCLOCK -- Quick fixes for the Real Time
    Clock bugs of the MM58167 RTC (leap year and year counter) chip
    and its interface with the system clock in your PC!  Use to
    replace Timer.Com.
    
    ~ SWAP, SCREEN, DUALS -- Programs for PCs with two display
    cards and monitors.  SWAP will toggle the active display and
    SCREENS will ensure both displays are initialized at boot-up.
    DUALS permits dual screen functioning from GWBASIC and is very
    useful for graphics demonstrations and debugging.
