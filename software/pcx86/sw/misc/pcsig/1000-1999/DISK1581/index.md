## Information about "SIMPLICITY"

    SIMPLICITY is an easy-to-use record-keeping database system that also
    prints mailing labels and Rolodex cards. It is fully menu-driven, so
    there is no need to read lengthy documentation in order to begin and no
    prior experience with database programs is necessary. SIMPLICITY is
    perfect for organizations, small businesses, and home use.
    
    SIMPLICITY supports a 500 record database, with each record having the
    following format: last name, first name, work phone, birthday, spouse
    name, work phone, up to six children's names and birthdays, street
    address, city, state, nine digit zip code, mailing zone, anniversary,
    personal note field, extended personal note card, and join date. All
    fields, except the first two, are optional. You can add, delete, or
    edit any record in the database using simple menu option selections.
    Search the database for matching records based on specific key fields.
    
    SIMPLICITY provides nine reports, three Rolodex options, and eight
    mailing label options. Printing reports, cards and labels may be by
    date range, zip code, alphabetic by letter, mailing code, or by
    selected fields. A comprehensive record directory can be printed that
    is a complete list of the database content sorted alphabetically.  A
    birthday report can be printed that will print a list of names who have
    a birthday on a given date or within a date range.
    
    Mailing labels can be printed by first name, spouse name, or both
    names. Mailing labels can be sorted by zip code and up to six copies
    can be printed.
