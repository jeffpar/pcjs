## Information about "SCREEN-DO"

    SCREEN-DO lets you design and create screens for use in
    BASIC programs.  Each screen that is saved to the disk can be accessed
    through the BLOAD command in BASIC.
    
    SCREEN-DO simplifies the process of editing screens through commands
    that let you easily delete, insert, move, and copy certain
    sections of the screen.  Another function displays the ASCII characters
    numbered 126 to 254 and let you display them on the screen.  One
    option lets you move the cursor across the screen to trace a
    certain character you selected.  SCREEN-DO has on-line help
    that makes it easy to learn, in addition to simplifying the designing of
    screens for use with BASIC programs.
