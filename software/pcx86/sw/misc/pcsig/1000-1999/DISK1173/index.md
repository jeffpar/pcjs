## Information about "RUNE-CASTER"

    In RUNE-CASTER, the casting of runes, an ancient tool of divination, is
    used as a modern method to explore personal understanding and growth.
    Runes are ancient letterings, each of which stands for a concept or
    theme such as names, momentum, thorn, beach, path, torch, giving, joy,
    hail, need, ice, harvest, support, kind, star, sprouts, horse, people,
    water, awaken, and home. Following a quick display of all 24 runes with
    these one-word definitions at the onset, the RUNE-CASTER Menu appears.
    The first selection lets you randomly select a rune by pressing a key
    while you concentrate on the thought you want some insight on. You are
    then presented with an explanation of and thoughts about the rune on the
    left side of the screen, and its detailed graphic representation on the
    right. The second selection approaches problems from the present
    situation, the challenge to the situation, and the consideration of
    future potential. The third selection, the spiral five selection, uses
    five runes to explore a topic in terms of its initial seed or vision and
    processes its coming to fruition. This method delves into the
    perspective of each rune fully before proceeding to the next rune and so
    on through the five runes.
    
    A brief history of rune usage is provided along with a bibliography
    covering the subject. The method of rune selection chosen is not a true
    random selection, but depends merely on the timing of pressing a key.
    Whether or not such timing yields divination is a matter for subjective
    speculation. However, the explanations and discussions of the runes are
    provocative and can lead to unique examinations of problems and
    decisions which could result in helpful insights.
    
    This program is easy to use and an effective means for distracting
    attention away from the workaday world to more fundamental and spiritual
    areas.
