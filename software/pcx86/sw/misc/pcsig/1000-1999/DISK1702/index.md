## Information about "MAILING LIST MANAGEMENT DISK 1OF2 (1703)"

    Does your business need to track customer contacts and print mailing
    labels for customer information?  The MAILING LIST MANAGEMENT DATABASE
    can do both jobs for you.
    
    The MAILING LIST MANAGEMENT DATABASE uses a single entry screen and a
    series of pop-up windows, selected by function keys.  These pop-up
    windows allow you to see the main entry screen as you select a
    particular function.  You'll never lose sight of your data.
    
    The database can maintain an unlimited number of files with up to 1,000
    records per datafile.  A fast search function will search through the
    selected data file for a particular record number, name, company,
    state,
    category, and/or ID number.  A file backup feature is included to
    safeguard against data corruption.  A file export function will allow
    the data to be sent to a file that can be imported to dBASE III+, LOTUS
    1-2-3, or any word processing system with an ASCII import feature.
