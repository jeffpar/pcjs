## Information about "GENAMORT"

    Thinking of taking out a loan for a house, new car, etc? Let GENAMORT
    calculate and print the payment amount and schedule for you. Find out
    how much that loan is really going to cost you.
    
    Calculate loans of up to $10,000,000 for a term of up to 999 months,
    which is over 83 years. A balloon payment can even be added to the
    calculation. Payments can be calculated on a monthly, quarterly,
    semi-yearly, and yearly basis. All input fields are contained on one
    input menu, using single keystroke entries. Subtotals of interest,
    payments, and principal are calculated to aid in preparing your taxes.
    
    The loan amortization schedule can be viewed on the screen or sent to
    the printer. The program can also calculate a periodic payment without
    printing a schedule.
