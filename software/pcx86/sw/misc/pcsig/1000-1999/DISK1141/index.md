## Information about "MENU-MATIC"

    MENU-MATIC is a hard disk menuing program that lets you access various
    programs on a hard disk by selecting a menu choice.  The program allows
    you to have 80 options per menu file, with an unlimited number of menu
    files.
    
    Some menus require a computer expert to set them up.  Then, the user is
    stuck if he or she wants to add another menu option, or change the menu
    in any way.  MENU-MATIC is written with the computer novice in mind;
    with its "Auto Generate" feature, you don't need to know complicated DOS
    commands to add another menu option.  You type in the name of the
    program you want to add, and the rest is done for you.
    
    Other features include screen-blackout, system statistics, time and date
    display, optional password protection, run-time parameters, usage
    tracking, timed execution of menu options, and keyboard macros.
