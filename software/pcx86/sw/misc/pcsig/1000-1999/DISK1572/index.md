## Information about "PC-ZIPPER"

    Why not speed up your computer?  PC-ZIPPER is software that will do
    exactly that without sacrificing performance.  The speed of a PC, XT, AT
    or even a 386 (and their clones) is rather arbitrarily determined by the
    manufacturer.  In actuality, if all the memory in your computer is sound
    there is no reason why you can't be running a little faster.  And who
    doesn't want to run a little faster?
    
    Ziptest is the first of two programs that come with PC-ZIPPER.  This
    utility calls procedures, executes a routine, times it, and then
    records the results.  Upon completion, Ziptest checks to find which
    procedure resulted in an increase in processor speed.  The results
    create a curve, where the optimum system performance is at the "crest"
    of the curve.  Zip, the main program, then can be set to maximize the
    speed of your computer.
    
    If you didn't understand all that, then just believe it works.
    PC-ZIPPER increased the speed of this reviewer's AT by nearly one full
    MHz according to Landmarks Speed test (note that no speed testing
    software is included with PC-ZIPPER).  You don't have to understand it
    to use it -- it's easy to install and control even for the beginner.
    PC-ZIPPER will check for weak or faulty memory, it can be turned off
    without rebooting, and it can be used to slow your computer
    slightly.  And, best of all, it uses NO memory.
