## Information about "LOTTO CHALLENGER"

    LOTTO CHALLENGER is a commercial quality lottery number selection
    program designed for use with all Pick-5, Pick-6 and Pick-7 lottery
    games.  Some of its functions can also be used with Daily 3 or 4 digit
    number games.
    
    Using statistical analysis, LOTTO CHALLENGER analyzes the numbers drawn
    in previous drawings.  Numbers are broken down into several categories:
    hot, cold, overdue, last drawing, 1 to 12, 13 to 31, and 32 and up.
    Averages and percentages are calculated from all the previous drawings
    for the above categories.  A quick picks menu option generates numbers
    to play based on previous drawing statistics.  A "winner's circle" menu
    option compares the numbers on your tickets to the numbers drawn.
    
    All program functions are menu driven and easy to use with the keyboard
    or a mouse.  Data entry screens prompt the user and will not allow
    invalid entry, and a pop-up help window is always available.  All this,
    combined with colorful sliding screens, make LOTTO CHALLENGER an
    enjoyable program to use.
    
    LOTTO CHALLENGER can be easily configured for any state lottery.  It is
    distributed with two current Florida state lottery data files which can
    be used to explore and learn how to use LOTTO CHALLENGER.  A state data
    file of your choice will be mailed to you at no charge when you
    register.
