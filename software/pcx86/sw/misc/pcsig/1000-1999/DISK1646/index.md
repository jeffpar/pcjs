## Information about "AMORT"

    AMORT generates loan amortization schedules for those of us without our
    PhD. in mathematics.  A major purchase such as a home or a car can be
    confusing enough, let alone trying to figure in your loan payments.
    With AMORT, you provide either the loan principal (in dollars), annual
    interest rate, loan period (in months), or monthly payment (in
    dollars).
    As long as you provide three of the four, AMORT can calculate the
    missing element.  In this way AMORT can help you answer questions about
    how much you can spend assuming a fixed monthly payment, or how much it
    will cost you each month assuming a certain overall price.
    
    AMORT assumes the annual interest rate is compounded monthly (ordinary
    or exact interest).  Loan amortization schedules can be sent to the
    printer, to the display screen, or both.  Printed output also can be
    customized with titles, additional fields indicating who the schedule is
    prepared for, and a description of the schedule.  These features make
    this an ideal tool for accountants, real estate agents, and anyone
    planning on buying or selling property.
    
    AMORT is menu driven, easy to use, and fully documented.
