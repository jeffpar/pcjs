## Information about "PC-GRAPHICS C"

    PC GRAPHICS is not just for HP BASIC types who need to port code to the
    IBM-PC.  These software tools provide an intuitive and powerful method
    for graphics programming that makes up for shortcomings in the standard
    Microsoft C library.
    
    PC GRAPHICS is a subset of the library primitives available in
    Hewlett-Packard workstation BASIC.  Here are procedures for
    soft-clipping, scaling, line patterns, pen colors, and text rotation
    that let you write two-dimensional graph plotting programs in Microsoft
    C. The scaling feature is especially useful as it lets you create your
    own scale, removing the need to think in pixels.  The package can also
    be used for simple animation.
