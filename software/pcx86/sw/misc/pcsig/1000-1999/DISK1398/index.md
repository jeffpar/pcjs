## Information about "FILE BROWSER"

    With FILEBROWSER, you can view the largest ASCII or WordStar files, and
    chop them down to size to fit your wordprocessor.
    
    This menu-driven tool lets you access big files, view them on the
    screen, copy specific blocks and print to a designated device.  You can
    read a screen at a time, jump back and forth within the file, or have
    the text automatically scroll.  It provides a quick search function for
    locating a particular word or line of text in a file.  A DOS shell is
    provided for easy access to an editor or wordprocessor, and the program
    offers on-line help and a well-written 20-page operations manual.
