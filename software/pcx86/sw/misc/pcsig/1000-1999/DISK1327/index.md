## Information about "DESTINY AND DAILY BREAD"

    DESTINY is a simple text-adventure game designed to teach Biblical
    truths. In each place encountered, you must make a decision in
    order to determine your destiny. The adventure has its own symbolism
    which must be interpreted to succeed in the game.
    
    DAILY BREAD is a Bible program that will display a different verse or
    reading from the King James version for every day of the year. One can
    read the entire Bible by following DAILY BREAD's daily readings for a
    whole year.
