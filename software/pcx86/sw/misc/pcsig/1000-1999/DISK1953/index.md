## Information about "BOWLSTAT DISK 1 OF 2 (1954 ALSO)"

    Bowling statisticians relax, BOWLSTAT keeps track of up to 300 bowlers
    on as many as 99 teams.  Supports tenpin, candlepin, and 5-pin bowling
    games.  Generates nightly captain sheets, and yearly statistics for each
    bowler.
    
    Most "standard" league individual awards have been included along with
    an option for saving of average sheets to the disk drive for
    wordprocessor integration.  The program is completely "SMART MENU"
    driven so there is no need to learn a bunch of commands.
    
    Keeps track of the individual statistics -- name, pinfall, number of
    strings bolwed, average, high single, high triple, high no mark, 69's;
    and team statistics -- name, points won, points lost, total pinfall,
    team high pinfall, and percent of wins vs losses.
