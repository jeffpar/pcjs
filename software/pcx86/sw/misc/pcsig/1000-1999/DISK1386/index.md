## Information about "P-ROBOTS"

    P-ROBOTS is a game that helps teach programming in Pascal.  The
    objective is to design and program a ``robot'' that can triumph over
    similar robots designed and programmed by others in a real-time battle
    of wits and flying missiles.
    
    You control your robot by writing a procedure in Pascal to specify your
    robot's behavior and strategy in its efforts to vanquish up to three
    other robots in a battle to the death.  A variety of pre-defined
    P-ROBOTS Pascal functions allow your robot to track its position on the
    battlefield, monitor its health or damage condition, and calculate the
    distance and angle to opponents from its current battlefield position.
    Each robot is equipped with a cannon to fire missiles, and a motorized
    drive mechanism to either close in to kill a hapless opponent or
    flee from a fierce foe.
    
    P-ROBOTS is an excellent way for the novice programmer to sharpen
    his/her Pascal skills and have fun at the same time.  However, P-ROBOTS
    does assume that the robot designer/programmer already knows the
    fundamentals of programming in Pascal.
    
    For the experienced programmer, P-ROBOTS offers a chance to see just how
    well you program in a programming environment where ``bad'' code can
    lead to graphic and ignoble defeat and ``brilliant'' code can bring
    triumph and glory.
