## Information about "MAGIC MENUS"

    MAGIC MENUS is a program that allows you to operate DOS and all your
    programs from simple pop-up menus.  Specific DOS commands are also
    included for changing and listing directories, copying files, deleting
    files, renaming files, and setting the time and date.  You can also run
    any other DOS command that you wish from MAGIC MENUS, or optionally
    return to DOS temporarily.  MAGIC MENUS also has a DOS window in which
    you can execute DOS commands.  It even remembers the last 10 DOS
    commands entered so that you do not need to retype them.
    
    With this program you may also create up to 10 menus that can
    automatically execute up to 100 programs.  These menus may include a
    short menu description, prompts to switch disks, prompts for additional
    command line information, and a password level to restrict usage.
    
    Additional functions in MAGIC MENUS include menu options for sending
    printer control codes to the printer and a pop-up financial calculator.
    MAGIC MENUS can also define up to 10 options for your AUTOEXEC.BAT and
    CONFIG.SYS files.
    
    A setup menu is included for screen blanking, screen colors, the video
    mode, a password system for the program, and general file paths.  MAGIC
    MENUS also has context-sensitive help to further simplify the operation
    of DOS and other program applications.
