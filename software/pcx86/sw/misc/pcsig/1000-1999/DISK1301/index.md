## Information about "FRONT END"

    FRONT END is a fairly technical menu-development system of primary
    interest to programmers.  Menus can be created for hard disks, or
    crowded floppies, allowing easy access to each program from the menu.
    The system lets you use nested menus (menu within a menu) for many more
    choices than would fit on the screen at once.  You can also change the
    display colors and the size of the menu window.
    
    FRONT END uses a unique programming language, similar in style to dBase
    III, and if you want to use this system's full potential, you should
    have at least brief exposure to some sort of programming; e.g., BASIC,
    dBase, or Pascal.  The documentation concerns itself mostly with
    command syntax reference rather than programming techniques.  There is
    a way provided to create menus without learning the language, but the
    full flexibility of the system is not truly available.  The
    documentation provided (23 pages) is technically-oriented.
