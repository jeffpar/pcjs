## Information about "THE SWAP UTILITIES"

    SWAP reduces the memory usage of four popular memory resident programs
    so you can use them even though you may have a shortage of RAM memory.
    Consisting of four separate utilities, SWAP will reduce Borland's
    SideKick and SideKick Plus memory usage to below 9,000 bytes each.
    Micro Logic's Tornado will need less that 8,000 bytes.  Microlytic's
    GOfer will need less than 8,500 bytes.
    
    The upshot is that you can squeeze more clout into your computer even
    though you may have an older PC with only 128K or 256K of RAM.
