## Information about "THE PRESIDENTS"

    Test your knowledge of each U.S. president.  In the first part, view the
    biographies of each president on the screen.  You can page through the
    text, search for a particular word or phrase, and write parts of the
    bibliography to other disk files.
    
    The second part quizzes and tests on the biographies of the presidents
    using 20 randomized multiple-choice questions.  Typical questions
    include: the president's name, sequence, inaugural year, birthdate,
    party
    affiliation, political party, state affiliation, and eventful
    associations.  Several versions can be produced on the screen or sent
    to the printer, each with its own answer key.
