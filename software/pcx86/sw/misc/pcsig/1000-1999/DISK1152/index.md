## Information about "MULTI-MERGE & QUIKSORT"

    MULTI-MERGE facilitates adding, editing, deleting, sorting, and printing
    information for later merging into your wordprocessing merge documents.
    Data can be sorted by name, company, zip, or two key fields you
    tailor to your own specifications.  It is not a program meant to replace
    a wordprocessor, but rather to enhance it.
    
    With MULTI-MERGE, you can manipulate your list, create your merge list,
    and then use your wordprocessor to merge the list with the
    wordprocessor's merge document.  The program is easy to use and
    completely menu driven, but you do need to know your wordprocessor's
    merge functions and DOS to operate the program with facility.
    File Descriptions:
    
    -------- ---  MULTI-MERGE.
    MERGE    EXE  The program file.
    MERGE    DBF  Data file.
    READ     ME   Information and instructions.
    README   BAT  Batch file to run the program.
    
    QUIKSORT is a high performance sort/merge utility for processing large
    data files.
    
    Sort an unlimited number of files and merge up to 16 files. QUIKSORT
    supports file sizes of up to 32 megabytes. An unlimited number of key
    fields and many different key field types are allowed. Records can be
    fixed or variable-length, and record lengths can be up to 32
    kilobytes. Extensive input record selection and output record
    formatting are supported.
    
    QUIKSORT outputs records, key fields, pointers, or key fields and
    pointers. Even wild card characters are allowed in file names. It
    sorts Btrieve and dBase III files and also provides high-language
    interfaces for a called subroutine. An outstanding sort/merge
    utility, QUIKSORT comes with extensive documentation.
