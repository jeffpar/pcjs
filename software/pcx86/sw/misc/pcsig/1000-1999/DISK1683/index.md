## Information about "EASY LABELS"

    There has never been a simpler, quicker label program.  Whether it's one
    or 99 labels you need, EASY LABEL is up to the job. It pops onto the
    screen in seconds, so straightforward help is not needed.
    
    A screen asks you to type in the contents of the label, line by line.
    It asks you the size and if you need a label printed for alignment
    purposes.  Flick a key and the label is on the way.  What you see is
    exactly what you get an instant later.
    
    The price for the simplicity is that nothing is saved to disk and you
    don't get sorting or all the other things complicated label programs
    offer.  But if your job requires a few labels now and then and you hate
    reading user manuals, this is the program for you.
