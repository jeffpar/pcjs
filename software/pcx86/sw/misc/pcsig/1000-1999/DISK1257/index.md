## Information about "DISK WIZ"

    DISK WIZ is a disk file manager, editor, and printer control center
    that pops up like magic at the DOS prompt or within running programs to
    provide an easy and convenient way to work with your computer. It is
    much easier and faster than DOS commands and provides many functions DOS
    doesn't, and is as simple to use as possible.
    
    DISK WIZ displays up to 100 alphabetized file and subdirectory names at
    a time, including hidden ones, and basic disk information. Selecting
    files or switching directories is as easy as moving the highlight bar to
    the name and pressing "Enter" -- no typing of names! Files may be
    selected in groups matching a pattern (i.e., ".BAK") or directories
    displayed with standard DOS wildcard matching. Files may be viewed
    "raw" or processed as text files, with word and line count and line
    numbering if wanted. ASCII files may be edited with the simple built in
    editor and text files can be printed out in several formats.
    
    DISK WIZ's printer control features let you send special codes from a
    user customizable menu of 20 single keystrokes for commonly used
    commands, such as condensed print and formfeeds or strings of commands
    for those used less often. DISK WIZ can swap output between two
    printers, LPT1 and LPT2, change the cursor shape and display all the
    screen colors and characters available on your computer. There is also a
    screen blanking feature to extend monitor life.
    
    A marvelous feature of the program is an interactive tutorial
    demonstration which leads you through the use of the program with lively
    sound effects and graphics.
