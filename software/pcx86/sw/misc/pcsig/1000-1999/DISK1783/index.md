## Information about "QEDIT ADVANCED"

    QEDIT is an extremely fast, easy-to-use, and fully-featured text editor
    for entering program code, letters, and small documents.    Just load
    and go.  And when loaded, QEDIT uses less than 56K of memory -- perfect
    for those who want to use QEDIT in conjunction with other software
    (e.g., dBase, FoxBase, Paradox) and do not have a lot of free memory to
    spare.
    
    A "pop-down" style menu system makes editing a snap.  There is a help
    screen which can be modified by the user, and the keyboard is completely
    reconfigurable.  The user can easily assign any QEDIT command to almost
    any key desired.  Also, the keyboard can be configured to look like
    WordStar, Brief or other popular editors.
    
    QEDIT is fully featured.  Although QEDIT is fast and easy to use, it
    doesn't skimp on features.  You still get all of the basic text editing
    features, plus many features found only on the more expensive editors.
    Edit dozens of files simultaneously, open up to eight windows, create
    macros with pause and keyboard recording, recover deleted text, and do
    line drawing.  Files to edit cannot be larger than available memory.
