## Information about "JOVE 1 OF 3 (ALSO 1430, 1454)"

    JOVE stands for Jonathan's Own Version of EMACS, the popular
    wordprocessor for programmers, used on mainframe computers.  This PC
    version has all the wordprocessing functions of its mainframe relative,
    with some interactive PC niceties.
    
    Experienced users will enjoy the convenience of using the same editor
    they use with UNIX.  JOVE provides simple insertion and deletion,
    multiple buffers and files, virtually unlimited file size, on-line help,
    file encryption, and more.  An extensive built-in macro command language
    and the complete C source code are also included for further
    customization.  JOVE goes beyond EMACS, with a LISP programmers' mode,
    added document functions, and operating system interaction.  On-disk
    documentation is backed up by a tutorial.
    File Descriptions:
    
    COMPRESS EXE  File compression utility.
    COMPRESS MAN  Manual for COMPRESS.
