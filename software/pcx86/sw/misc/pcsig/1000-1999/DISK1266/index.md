## Information about "HOME MOVIE LIBRARIAN"

    HOME MOVIE LIBRARIAN provides you with a database and catalog of your
    home movies which can include movie titles, movie starting and ending
    positions, and quality of the recording.  Another valuable feature is
    the ability to list movies that have a certain cast character.  For
    example, you could list all the movies that Eddie Murphy is in.  It
    will print several types of reports sorted by title or tape number.
    
    The program includes a partial listing of home video movies from A-AN
    which can be browsed through, added to or printed out by type, such as
    drama, comedy, etc.
