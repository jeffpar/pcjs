## Information about "GANTT & SCHEDULE 2 OF 2 (ALSO 593)"

    This is a group of project management aids that produce presentation-
    quality Gantt charts -- graphic displays of schedules -- from a list of
    projects, dates and times.
    
    Four primary applications are provided: Gantt chart transparencies for
    meeting displays, the ability to directly drive a video projector from a
    PC for meeting displays, Gantt charts for insertion into the
    text files of word processors, and direct use to view project status.
    These types of displays are commonly used throughout industry for
    management presentations of project status and resource use.
