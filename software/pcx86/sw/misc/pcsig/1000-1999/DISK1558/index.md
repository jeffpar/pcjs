## Information about "PC-JIGSAW"

    PC-JIGSAW is an educational game of skill and intellect that starts out
    drawing an image on the screen and then it shuffles the pieces. The
    object of the game is to assemble the pieces to match the original
    image on the screen.  You can use either the keyboard or a mouse to move
    the pieces.
    
    PC-JIGSAW is completely menu driven and comes with an on-line help
    facility to quide you through the operation of the program.  You select
    the image you want from the Images menu and then select Start from the
    main menu to begin playing.  You can view the original image at any time
    to help you along.  You can even change the level of complexity by
    making the PC-JIGSAW image pieces smaller or larger.  The fewer pieces
    you swap, the better your score.  Also, every time you view the image,
    points are subtracted from your score.  PC-JIGSAW comes with four
    puzzles you can solve.  If you like jigsaw puzzles, you will love PC-
    JIGSAW.
