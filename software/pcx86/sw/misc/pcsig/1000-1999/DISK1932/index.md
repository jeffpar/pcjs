## Information about "TURBO-LESSONS 5.0"

    Here are 16 different lessons in Turbo Pascal that teach you more than
    the elements of the language -- you'll also learn programming technique
    and gain experience through practice.  Each TURBO-LESSON is a bite-size
    tutorial which introduces one or more new concepts.  Each of the lessons
    is presented in the same format, clear objectives followed by an
    organized tutorial.  Most lessons direct you to work with a sample
    program which is provided with these lessons.
    
    Programmers who had difficulty learning Pascal from reference books will
    find they are able to make better progress.  The programming techniques
    you learn will save you time and frustration in your future programming.
    The lessons are designed to encourage you to try things on your own.
    
    Lesson titles include:
    
    ~ Essential editing skills
    
    ~ Program structure
    
    ~ Declarations, input
    
    ~ Integer expressions
    
    ~ Conditional processing
    
    ~ REPEAT statement
    
    ~ CASE statement
    
    ~ FOR statement
    
    ~ WHILE statement
    
    ~ Introduction to functions
    
    ~ A function to detect errors
    
    ~ Strings
    
    ~ Introduction to procedures
    
    ~ Interactive screen handling
