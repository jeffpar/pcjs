## Information about "P4UP"

    P4UP compresses 4 normal page images onto one page (four quadrants) of
    output, using its own fonts, with an HP LaserJet II printer.  P4UP is
    very easy to use in command line form (just like DOS print) and has
    several options to change the order of the quadrants.  No soft font
    expertise is required.  It is ideal for printing large documents or
    program source files.  Since four pages are shrunk to one piece of
    paper a lot of desk space (and paper) can be saved.
