## Information about "ZOOMRACKS 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1288)"

    Organize everything in your home or business with one of the premier
    information management systems in all the IBM PC world -- ZOOMRACKS.
    More than just a great database, ZOOMRACKS uses its patented card and
    rack metaphor to allow you to organize everything from business letters
    to your finances.  Whole businesses are running on ZOOMRACKS alone.
    
    ZOOMRACKS is based on a simple, real world object: racks containing
    cards that have information on them. Imagine a rack hanging on the
    door of a doctor's examining room that holds cards containing the
    patients' medical records. The top of every card is visible when
    looking at the entire rack, so you look for the desired patient's
    record, then pull that card and view it. Essentially, this is how
    ZOOMRACKS operates on your computer.
    
    This simple idea makes ZOOMRACKS one of the fastest and easiest
    databases to use, according to COMPUTE! MAGAZINE which bestowed its
    1989 Choice award on ZOOMRACKS, as one of the 13 best products of the
    year, and the best database. With full text searching, a powerful
    macro language, online help and the multi-talents of database and word
    processor -- as well as many of the functions of a spreadsheet -- there
    should be little wonder why ZOOMRACKS is zooming into both homes and
    businesses as the "do all" program everyone wants.
    
    Unlike a traditional database where you are limited by the specified
    fields, with ZOOMRACKS you have the option of putting anything you want
    on a card, including information into preset fields. If you want to
    write a letter, go to a card and start writing. Word processing is an
    integral part of ZOOMRACKS. If you want to organize class notes,
    maintain records of all business correspondence with your clients, or
    manage you home budget, ZOOMRACKS is a powerful solution.
    
    Like a spreadsheet, ZOOMRACKS uses templates. You define what kind of
    information you will be storing in a rack by defining a rack template.
    Change the format of any rack at any time. Add fields, sort fields,
    rearrange and move fields, perform mathematical functions, change the
    names or the widths of fields, even change the name of the rack, if you
    like. You can easily build your own templates or use pre-designed
    templates (also available from PC-SIG) for home management, general
    business and accounting.
    
    It does takes time to learn the initial commands, but the program is
    very convenient to use, once learned. Help screens and a tutorial are
    included. Works great with or without a mouse.

Program Title:  ZOOMRACKS
PC-SIG version: 1.2

Organize everything--home or business--with one of the premier
information management systems in all the IBM PC world, ZOOMRACKS.  More
than a great database, ZOOMRACKS uses its patented card and rack
metaphor to allow you to organize everything from business letters, to
your finances.  Whole businesses are running on ZOOMRACKS alone.

ZOOMRACKS is based on a simple, real world object: Racks which contain
cards that have information on them.  Imagine a rack hanging on the door
of a doctor's examining room that holds cards containing the patients'
medical records.  The top of every card is visible when looking at the
entire rack, so you look for the desired patient's record then pull that
card and view it.  Essentially, this is how ZOOMRACKS operates on your
computer.

This simple idea makes ZOOMRACKS one of the fastest and easiest
databases to use, according to COMPUTE!  MAGAZINE which bestowed its
1989 Choice award on ZOOMRACKS as one of the 13 best products of the
year, and the best database.  With full text searching, a powerful macro
language, online help and the multi-talents of database and word
processor---as well as many of the functions of a spreadsheet---there
should be little wonder why ZOOMRACKS is zooming into both homes and

Like a spreadsheet, ZOOMRACKS uses templates.  You define what kind of
information you will be storing in a rack by defining a rack template.
You can change the format of any rack at any time.  You can add fields,
sort fields, rearrange and move fields, perform mathematical functions,
change the names or the widths of fields, even change the name of the
rack, if you like.  You can easily build your own templates or use
pre-designed templates, which are also available from PC-SIG, for home
management, general business and accounting.

Many will see a similarity between ZOOMRACKS' ability to zoom-in on a
part of the screen and pull up additional information, even pictures, to
that of the "HyperCard" concept.  Interestingly, ZOOMRACKS was actually
developed before HyperCard.

This program does take a little time to learn the initial commands, but
is very convenient to use once learned.  Works great with or without a
mouse.

Usage:  Database/General Multiuse Computing Platform.
