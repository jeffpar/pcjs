## Information about "PC-BID+"

    PC-BID, developed for contractors, is a database program for bid items,
    but it can also be useful to others for obtaining cost estimates.  For
    each bid-item, you may record the costs for labor, equipment, materials
    and sub-contractors, along with the prices.  PC-BID also provides for
    various percentage overhead factors such as insurance, taxes and other
    costs based on the various bid cost items.  You may edit or delete bid
    records individually.  The program also allows you to change all bid
    unit costs by a percentage factor.  A standard labor rate for each bid
    can also be used for those using time based labor records.  After the
    data is entered you may print out reports for bid estimates, bid
    analyses, bid proposals, and master listings of each bid category.
