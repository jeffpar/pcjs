## Information about "STOCK MARKET TIMER"

    When should you buy and when should you sell your stocks?  What numbers
    should you watch?  The STOCK MARKET TIMER uses figures from your daily
    newspaper to time your actions to ongoing trends, not whims.
    This market analyzer is based upon M. G. Zahorchak's book entitled "The
    Art of Low Risk Investing."  Mr. Zahorchak's main idea was to help the
    individual investor to protect himself from himself.  That is, to give
    the investor a method of investing other than investing on hot tips or a
    stock some "guru" is touting that week.
    
    To that end, he presented guidelines to investing based on several
    moving averages.  If followed, the investor could expect to at least
    approach future investments with some discipline in his trading
    activities.
    
    The data STOCK MARKET TIMER uses is quite simple and readily
    available.  Market direction is determined from three sources:  the
    weekly closing DJIA; the weekly number of Advancing and Declining
    stocks on the NY Stock Exchange; and the S&P500 weekly closing
    figures.  Individual stocks are selected by the system user and are thus
    unique to the individual.
