## Information about "BID-BIZ"

    If you're a contractor looking for an inexpensive but powerful
    estimating program, try BID BIZ.  This program is for those who bid jobs
    or estimate costs based on a number of different components, phase
    costs, or various items.  The program uses windows for viewing multiple
    records, editing, and various searches.  All files have virtually
    unlimited record capacities.
    
    The program allows for two types of burden factors, direct and indirect.
    The direct burdens are applied directly to the unit amounts used in the
    estimate listings.  This can be useful for such purposes as sales taxes
    or storage costs on materials, or other increased costs as needed.
    Indirect burdens are used as overhead factors and added at the end of
    the direct cost extensions.  They are used for the normal taxes and
    insurance, bond premiums, general overhead, etc.
    
    The program allows you to enter notes and comments with various factors
    used in estimating.  It also makes it easy to compare between the
    different alternatives you have to do a job.
