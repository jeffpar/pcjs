## Information about "LORAN LOCATOR"

    LORAN LOCATOR is an "electronic numbers book" for those mariners who
    accumulate LORAN numbers for their fishing and diving hot spots.
    Fifteen LORAN chains around the world are supported. Using the system
    requires prior knowledge of the Loran C navigational system, and the
    author suggests that a Loran manual be kept handy to enter GRI's. The
    package is configured to operate in any Loran chain in the United States
    and most chains worldwide, and is intended to be used ONLY as a guide.
    
    LORAN LOCATOR calculates heading and distance between any waypoint
    entered. Multiple data files, scratch pad function, waypoint register,
    and float plans are all supported.
