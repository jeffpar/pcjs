## Information about "SIMBASE 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1186)"

    SIMBASE is a baseball simulation program.  It contains data for two
    teams.  This program gives you a tool to analyze the value of a
    particular player or a group of players to the team over the course of
    one or more full seasons.  It lets you review the pluses and minuses of
    different player lineups.  And it provides a framework where you can
    forecast the likely outcome for a full baseball season.  To really use
    SIMBASE productively, you must run a large number of games and look at
    the averages.  Once you are familiar with the program, you will want to
    amend the LINEUPS.DAT file by shuffling or adding and subtracting
    players.  This is easily done with any wordprocessor that reads and
    writes ASCII files.
