## Information about "HYPERSHELL"

    HYPERSHELL offers a powerful yet straightforward method of linking
    different text files by key words.  By placing codes within your text
    you can allow others to follow their interest from one file to another.
    Maneuvering of key words creates a type of on-screen menu which allows
    users to quickly move through documents directly related to their
    interests or needs.
    
    For example, you are reading a text file called "Personnel" searching
    for information regarding severance policies.  The document doesn't tell
    you enough about severance policies so you access other documents on
    your system regarding this subject until you find the right one.  Once
    you designate reference words which link related files together, these
    links can be bridged easily by anyone.  In the example above,
    "severance" would be the reference word and would appear as a
    highlighted word in the file "Personnel."  Using cursor keys or a mouse,
    move to "severance" and press return.  All text files you have tagged as
    related to the topic are now at your fingertips without leaving your
    original document.
    
    HYPERSHELL assists you in the initial set-up of a hypertext system by
    providing a hypertext editor, syntax checker, and formatted printer
    program, as well as several helpful utilities.
