## Information about "PROINSTALLER"

    Programmers, here is a program that allows you to automate even the
    most complex application installations.  One command starts this program
    which walks users through the entire installation -- complete with
    prompt screens and help text that you create.
    
    Make it easier for your customers to install your software on their
    fixed disk without having to run a Batch file or follow intricate
    instructions buried in a read.me file.
    
    Your end users have the option to accept/or change the following: which
    drive to install from; which drive to install to; which directory and/or
    sub-directory to install in; whether to add path statement; whether to
    change buffer statement; whether to change file statement.
    
    This program does take up 200K of disk space itself.  Therefore, it is
    most appropriate for applications with lots of disks.
