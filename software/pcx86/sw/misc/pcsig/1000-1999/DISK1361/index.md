## Information about "PC-POSTCARD PLUS"

    PC-POSTCARD PLUS uses your standard dot matrix printer to produce and
    address postcards with your custom message, such as business
    announcements, reminders and social invitations.  Even does double
    postcards!
    
    With first-class mail costing 25 cents and bulk mail now almost
    17 cents a piece, postcard mailings have suddenly become the darling of
    thrift-minded businesses and organizations.  You get first-class
    delivery and immediate attention for just 15 cents.  Here's a program
    that lets you produce customized postcards -- both singles and doubles,
    with or without a mailing permit -- and even individually addresses
    them!
    
    Using standard-sized (4x6) pin-fed postcards, PC-POSTCARD PLUS prints a
    message 22 lines by 55 characters, an address, and an optional header
    for the return address, postal mailing permit stamp, etc.  It has
    formats for your messages for both sides of a single or double
    postcard.
    Double postcards are great as they allow for a tear-off response card
    for orders, RSVPs, and such. membership events, etc.
    
    Addresses are automatically inserted as each card prints.  Mailing lists
    can be built, added to and sorted by up to 10 different fields.  Since
    PC-POSTCARD PLUS was written by Carl Mieske, author of PC-MAIL
    (PC-SIG disks #868, #869), PC-MAIL mailing lists are compatible for use
    with this program, but not required.
