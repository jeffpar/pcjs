## Information about "MCMURPHY'S MANSION AND RED PLANET"

    MCMURPHY'S MANSION is a text adventure game that begins when your Uncle
    McMurphy dies and leaves you his fortune.  Unfortunately, the money is
    hidden somewhere on his estate.  The object of the game is to find the
    money, using various clues and objects.  Both a map and an inventory
    list are displayed on the screen, and you can save at any time.
    
    The first manned expedition to Mars occurred in the year 2075.  A lone
    astronaut, Captain Maltwee, successfully landed on the Red Planet and
    discovered that an advanced civilization had flourished there for
    thousands of years.  Recent global wars had decimated the inhabitants,
    leaving but a few isolated bands of Martians intact.  Through radio
    messages from Maltwee, the Earth Federation learned that he had gained
    the confidence of a religious order who inhabited the ancient city of
    Aukbaa.  Maltwee soon learned that this order had collected the wealth
    of the old rulers and had hidden it in a secret underground vault.  His
    last message to Earth indicated that he had discovered the secret vault
    and planned to steal the treasure.
    
    It is now two years later.  You have been selected by the Federation to
    travel to the Red Planet.  Your mission is to find Captain Maltwee and
    return with the treasures of Aukbaa, to Earth.
