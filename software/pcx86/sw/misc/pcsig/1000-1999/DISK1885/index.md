## Information about "CONLOG"

    An Amateur radio (Ham) logging and log printing program specifically for
    the ARRL November sweepstakes contest.
    In the world of the amateur radio operator, or Ham, documentation is a
    priority. There's a need to know who you have contacted, when you made
    the contact, the parameters of the frequency, etc.  Recording this
    information calls for a lot of pencil pushing over several forms.
    
    CONLOG eases the finger cramp associated with radio logging by providing
    a single structured data entry screen for the radio operator.  Working
    in the radio room, CONLOG accepts the log information field by field as
    the operator makes the call.  Later, CONLOG prints the contact
    documentation on American Radio Relay League approved forms.  CONLOG
    also prints radio statistics, including: avgerage number of contacts per
    minute, total contacts for each band, and number of contacts since last
    band change.
    
    CONLOG also provides a screen standby feature to avoid video burn-in, a
    DOS shell feature, and a notepad. The manual provides several sample
    data entry screens.
