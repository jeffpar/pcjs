## Information about "BILLPOWER PLUS"

    BILLPOWER PLUS is an extremely powerful time-keeping, billing, and
    bookkeeping system designed specifically for small firms.
    
    It's designed to help attorneys, accountants, and other professionals
    keep precise records and bill regularly. BILLPOWER PLUS tracks time
    worked on professional matters and calculates the amount owed by each
    client. It also keeps up with receipts and disbursements, and it
    maintains such accounts, allowing you to carry out simple bookkeeping
    functions. Perhaps most importantly, it automatically compiles service,
    disbursement, and receipt transactions for each client into monthly
    bills.
    
    BILLPOWER PLUS offers a degree of integration not found in other time
    and billing programs. It can simultaneously update affected G/L
    accounts (as well as a client's balance and aged receivables) at the
    time a disbursement or receipt is entered. This "real time" approach to
    bookkeeping saves you the time you would otherwise spend making
    duplicate G/L entries, posting transactions, and/or transferring files
    from one program to another.
    
    BILLPOWER PLUS is designed as a unique "free entry" system. You can
    open accounts at will, any time you want. You can correct nearly any
    entry made at any time in the past. Also unique is BILLPOWER PLUS's
    ability to re-prepare bills. Transaction data is not destroyed when
    bills are prepared; therefore, it is easy to re-prepare bills that may
    be even several months old. BILLPOWER PLUS can handle any combination
    of the following: 15 timekeepers/employees (partners, secretaries, and
    others), 4000 cases, 4000 accounts, and 8000 transaction entries per
    month (services, disbursements, etc.).
