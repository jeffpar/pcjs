## Information about "THE ELECTRICAL DBS 1 OF 2 (#1978 ALSO)"

    THE ELECTRICAL REFERENCE DATABASE gives electricians, engineers,
    designers, and panel shop operators one place on your computer where you
    can find those little notes that only experience produces. In this case
    a professional has given you his experience and created a forum for you
    to add your own.
    
    Databases include:
    
    ~ DC motors
    
    ~ Single phase motors
    
    ~ Three phase induction motors
    
    ~ Three phase wound rotor motors
    
    ~ Three phase synchronous motors
    
    ~ NEMA data
    
    ~ Motor frame sizes
    
    ~ Three phase conductors ampacities
    
    ~ Single phase conductor ampacities
    
    ~ Maximum conductors in conduit
    
    ~ Three phase transformers
    
    ~ Recommended copper wire and transformer sizes.
    
    Motor databases provide information as to full load currents, motor over
    current protection rating, the size or guage of the wire required to
    connect one motor of that particular horsepower in a general purpose
    application, the conduit trade size required to house the wire, the NEMA
    size starter recommended, the amperage and the recommended fusing.
    
    The present data is referred to as "seed" data just to get you started.
    You may add and delete data as you like. Each data base can handle a
    maximum of 2.1 billion entries.
    
    Each database is menu-driven and complete with its own help function
    and notes field. Use this data base as a tool -- not as a replacement
    for the NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE manual. All information assumes a
    single motor installation. Consult your NEC manual for the details of
    your particular installation.
