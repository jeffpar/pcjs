## Information about "SAMFB-THE MORSE CODE PROGRAM"

    As one must learn hand signals before one operates a vehicle, so must
    one learn Morse Code before one fires up an amateur radio.  You
    could begin with a healthy diet of how-to books, cassette tapes and LP
    records, followed by several weekends of personal instruction at a local
    Ham radio club.  But that might get costly.  What you need is a Morse
    Code instructor you can call on any time to teach you at your own pace.
    
    SAMFB, The Morse Code Program, is such an instructor.  SAMFB takes you
    through the basics of coding with hands-on keying right at your PC
    keyboard.  SAMFB listens to your dits and dahs, types out what you
    keyed, and quizzes you with random words, all at a speed you set
    yourself.
    
    If you get stuck, or bogged down, don't fret.  SAMFB has an on-line,
    context sensitive help system.  Several pull-down menus and
    configuration areas give further help.
