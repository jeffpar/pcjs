## Information about "MAZE CUBE"

    Remember magic squares -- those little black and white plastic puzzles
    with the 24 numbered tiles and one empty space?  You had to slide the
    tiles back and forth until you got all the numbers in the right order.
    This is the computer version and it's all grown up!
    
    MAZE CUBE is an addictive puzzle strategy game for all ages.  The object
    is to match a given pattern with the fewest number of moves.  It is a
    great way to help younger players develop logical thinking and spacial
    relationship concepts.  For the older player, it's just plum good fun!
    MAZE CUBE is entirely menu-driven and provides thorough on-screen
    instructions.  Age level: 6-adult.
    
    Also included are 25 different puzzles of varying degrees of difficulty.
    A nice feature is the autoplay facility that replays your best game so
    you can see where improvements are needed.  The program also lets you
    design your own puzzle patterns, up to a maximum of 99 different games.
    This is the first game in the "Mind Maze" series, Wreck Tangle (Disk
    #1836) is the second.
