## Information about "TEACHER WORKS"

    TEACHER WORKS is for teachers and school administrators who want to do
    it their way.  TEACHER WORKS lets people use their favorite type of
    grading system, not conform to a grading method understood by a
    programmer.  Requiring a minimum of keystrokes, the program tackles
    classes of up to sixty students.
    
    TEACHER WORKS lets teachers grade by points or grade averages, using
    either letter or numeric grades.  With a maximum of 240 grades per
    semester per student, teachers can weight grades within six categories
    and give extra credit.  Calculated grades can be adjusted for the
    student who really worked but barely missed achieving a certain grade.
    
    The teacher can edit one grade or the whole class on a single screen,
    adding grades in any order.  Complete student records can be displayed
    and edited.  Student records can be formatted and printed to meet the
    requirements of most districts.  Students, and their records, can be
    transferred between classes.
    
    You can use quarterly, trimester, or year round grading.  Grades can be
    calculated by what the student has been assigned, so new check-ins are
    not penalized for grades they missed -- unless you choose to do so.
    Class, student, and individual grades can be searched.  Class grade
    averages are generated.  Students are automatically assigned ID numbers
    which can be changed later.  Grade printouts can be done by ID numbers
    to protect student anonymity.  Data files are dBase III compatible so
    that they can be used by other commercial programs such as dBXL,
    FoxBase, PCTools, FormWorx, Quattro, or PC-File.
