## Information about "SS1 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1415)"

    This combo of programs solves 70% of your computing needs!  This
    integrated program combines a wordprocessor, a list/data manager,
    communications, a mid-size spreadsheet (64 columns by 255 rows), and a
    file and directory browser.  To make the program even more
    comprehensive, pop-up aids are a keystroke away anywhere in the system.
    These include a calculator, an aid for graphing data, file/directory
    viewing, DOS shell interface, and a utility to make macros or smart
    keys.
    
    Packed with features, the wordprocessor offers functions normally found
    only in the top of-the-line packages.  The commands are unique to this
    program, but are easy to learn and fast.  The mailing list manager uses
    standard text files, can edit columns, and sort, select and print
    records as reports or mailing labels.  The spreadsheet has all the
    standard functions, plus handling multiple pages.
    
    The communications program is one of the broadest on the market.  It can
    communicate through almost every modem.  However, this tremendous
    flexibility requires you to configure it for your particular system the
    first time you use it.  The file and directory browser/manager, on the
    other hand, is fairly easy to use and a great help in dealing with hard
    disk housekeeping.  All the commands found in many separate programs are
    at your fingertips: backups, deletions, printing, viewing and directory
    alterations.
    
    The pop-ups include a calculator, file and directory checker, a print
    screen utility, a graph maker, and programmable "hot" or "smart"
    keys (macros).  The calculator supports decimal, hex, and binary for
    basic arithmetic functions.  The help system provides instant access to
    more than 100 screens of context-sensitive help.

This combo of programs will solve 70% of your computing needs!  The two
disk set combines a word processor, a list/data manager, communications,
a mid-size spreadsheet, and a file and directory browser.  To make the
program even more comprehensive, pop-up aids are a keystroke away
anywhere in the system.  These include a calculator, an aid for graphing
data, file/directory viewing, DOS shell interface and a utility for
making macros or smart keys.

Packed with features, the word processor offers functions normally found
only in the top of the line packages.  The commands are unique to this
program, but they are easy to learn and fast.  The mailing list manager
uses standard text files, can edit columns, and sort, select and print
records as reports or mailing labels.  The spreadsheet provides all the
standard functions, plus handling multiple pages.

The communications program is one of most general on the market, making
it capable of communicating through almost every modem.  However, this
tremendous flexibility may make it difficult to configure for your
particular system the first time you use it.  The file and directory
browser/manager, on the other hand, is fairly easy to use and a great
help in dealing with hard disk housekeeping.  You have all the commands
found in many separate programs at your fingertips: backups, deletions,

The pop-ups include a calculator, file and directory checker, a print
screen utility, a graph maker, and programmable "hot" or "smart" keys.
The calculator supports decimal, hex and binary for basic arithmetic
functions.  The help system provides instant access to more than 100
screens of context-sensitive help.

Program Limitations: This is an evaluation copy and, while it is fully
functional, there are limitations.  The spreadsheet, 64 columns by 255
rows, is only half the size of the full program.  The Spell Checker
dictionary is omitted along with almost half of the system
documentation.  Users who register their copy will receive a full
system, a printed manual, a set of quick reference cards, support, and
update news.
