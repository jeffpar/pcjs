## Information about "LOANSTAR"

    LOANSTAR is an easy to use loan calculator and amortization program for
    fixed and variable rate loans.  LOANSTAR allows for advance payments to
    be paid at any month and shows you any savings incurred as a result of
    making advance payments.  Annual interest paid is also displayed to aid
    in tax calculations.
    
    LOANSTAR is an excellent menu driven program for calculating and
    tracking any loan.  The program solves for payment, interest rate,
    length of loan, or amount of loan.  The amortization schedule displays
    on the screen or printer the monthly balance, equity, principle, and
    interest.  Also shown on a monthly basis are advance payments, rate
    changes, and payment changes, if any.  LOANSTAR displays on an annual
    basis total interest paid for income tax purposes.  The amount of time
    and money saved as a result of making advance payments is shown on the
    last year of the schedule.  All of this can be saved to disk for later
    recall and update.  LOANSTAR is great for keeping track of a long
    mortgage.
