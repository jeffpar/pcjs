## Information about "BOAT BOX"

    BOATBOX is an attractive series of reading drills for children,
    ages 3-7. Parents need to assist their children in these exercises.
    
    Each of four word lists contain 26 unique words. When the word is read
    correctly, the helper pushes the "+" key to reward the pupil with
    brightly-colored objects dancing on the screen to merry music.
    
    Missed words are repeated after all 26 words are completed. When all
    words have been read properly, the pupil is rewarded with flashing
    lights, a siren wail and a cartoon of dancing teddy bears.
