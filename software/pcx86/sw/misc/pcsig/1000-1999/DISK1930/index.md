## Information about "D-ACCESS"

    D-ACCESS provides access to all the functions available in the IBM DOS
    and BIOS, access to the I/O ports including the mouse and direct memory
    operations, all from FORTRAN.  No longer are you restricted to the
    functions provided by the FORTRAN compiler.  Use as high level or as low
    level a function as you need.
    
    D-ACCESS is a set of interface modules which you can call from within
    FORTRAN with the appropriate parameters.  In most cases these parameters
    are 8086/80286 register values.  The modules in turn call DOS, BIOS or
    the mouse driver, or perform direct I/O or memory operations.
    Applications where D-ACCESS will be extremely valuable include graphics
    programs, database programs, sound programs, mouse based user interface
    programs, communication programs, and printer oriented utilities.
    
    Since effective use of DOS, BIOS, I/O, mouse or direct memory requires
    some knowledge of the 8086 family of CPUs, the IBM PC microcomputer
    family architectures, PC-DOS (or MS-DOS), BIOS and the mouse driver
    MOUSE.SYS, this program includes a recommended reading list for the
    serious programmer.
