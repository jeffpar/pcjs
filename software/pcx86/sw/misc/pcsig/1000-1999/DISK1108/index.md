                              HOME MANAGEMENT II


              Congratulations!  You are the owner of what we think is 
         one of the best values available today in home financial man-
         agement software.  In the fall of 1985 we introduced Home 
         Management 1.  It was useful, but by today's standards lim-
         ited.  However, it had and still has many satisfied users.  
         But we knew that more was needed.

              Following upon the success of Home Management I, we 
         asked, "What next?"  The answer is Home Management II, a com-
         pletely rewritten package of five programs to help you keep 
         track of your money plus a whole lot more.  Unlike other home 
         finance software, ours is uncomplicated, easy to learn and 
         use, and written so that you need learn only those portions 
         of the software you will actually use.  

              Let's face it.  Different people want to do different 
         things in financial planning.  Some want only to balance 
         their checkbook, others want to track stocks, still others 
         want to plan their family budget, and so on.  But not every-
         one wants to do all these tasks.  With the five programs in 
         Home Management II you can do all of this -- and much more.  
         But since each program is self-contained, you need learn only 
         what you use.  We keep it simple because we know how frus-
         trating it is to waste time learning (and paying for!) parts 
         of a program which are useless for you.

              Much financial management software tries to be all 
         things to all people, both in the home and business.  As a 
         result it does little useful work for anyone.  We've taken a 
         different approach.  Instead of incorporating all tasks into 
         one giant program, we've included five different programs in 
         Home Management II.  This makes the sum of all the parts more 
         flexible, and we hope, more suited to the individual needs of 
         the home user.

              Whether you're a homeowner or a renter, there's some-
         thing for you in Home Management II.  All five programs in 
         the package are designed to help you out with many of those 
         big and little chores that get in the way of what you really 
         want to do.  Following is a brief description of each one.

         BUDGET -- A flexible and easy-to-use checking account and fi-
                   nances manager.  Features include:

          * handles multiple accounts
          * 54 expense categories and 30 deposit categories, all user-
            defined (except for the last category of each, which is 
            reserved for the total of all categories)
          * Completely menu-driven; no special commands to remember
          * Extremely fast; all sorts conducted in RAM (not from disk)
          * Sort entries by month or category

         TYPEWRITER -- You say your typewriter broke and you need to 
                       fill out one more form?  Typewriter turns your 
                       computer into a memory typewriter.  Great for 
                       whenever a word-processor just isn't right.  
                       Program filename -- TYPER.COM

         PBP -- (Personal Budget Planning) A recursive personal budget 
                model that prompts you through the otherwise pain-
                staking chore of planning your spending.  Takes away 
                the drudgery and assists in setting up a personal bud-
                get you can live with.  Program filename -- PBP.EXE.

                      tables including payment number, year, periodic 
                      payment, payment interest, total interest, pay-
                      ment principle, total principle and balance due.  
                      Plus, it calculates your monthly payment amount 
                      and final payment, which is usually different.  
                      It also allows you to change any value at a key-
                      stroke for quick loan comparison.  Program file-
                      name -- QUIK.COM

         STOCK BROKER -- Keep track of stock transactions and compare 
                         your portfolio to the performance of the Dow 
                         Jones Industrials.  Stock Broker also pro-
                         duces printouts and allows you to open as 
                         many data files as you like.  Program file-
                         name -- STOCKS.EXE


         Note:  Before continuing, please make a working copy of your 
                Home Management II distribution diskette.  To do this, 
                first format a blank disk.  Then place your Home Man-
                agement II distribution diskette in drive A and your 
                newly formatted diskette in drive B (if you have two 
                drives).  Type copy *.*. If you have one drive, use 
                the DISKCOPY command as explained in your computer's 
                users guide.  After the files have all copied onto the 
                new diskettes, label them, and store your distribution 
                diskettes in a safe place.


                  A WORD ABOUT COPY PROTECTION AND COPYRIGHT
 
              MVP Software doesn't copy-protect its distribution pro-
         gram diskettes.  We hate to work with copy-protected software 
         as much as you do, it's expensive, and the schemes are broken 
         almost as fast as they are devised.  We do, however, realize 
         that some unscrupulous users likely will take advantage of 
         this and illegally copy our copyrighted programs.  But if you 
         want to continue to have low-cost quality software available, 
         don't give your software away.  We can continue to maintain 
         our low prices only as long as our customers recommend that 
         those interested in our programs purchase them.

                                PROGRAM MANUAL

              Each Home Management II program is easy to learn and 
         use.  However, please read all instructions carefully before 
         you attempt to run any program.  Then read the instructions 
         again as you are running the program for the first time.


                               RUNNING A PROGRAM

              All programs in Home Management II are run from DOS.

                                    BUDGET

              More than a simple checkbook ledger and balancing aid, 
         Budget is a sophisticated and easy-to-use tool for keeping 
         track of one's checking payments and deposits and for per-
         forming budgetary analysis.  It allows the user to enter 
         checks and deposits and to sort and analyze them by category 
         and/or month.  A combination of graphic data display and 
         printout options facilitates comparison of spending habits, 
         so the user can easily determine where he's spending his mon-
         ey, in which areas he can expand his own personal or family 
         budget, and in which areas expenses can be trimmed.  In addi-
         tion, since the spending categories are user-defined, Budget 
         can also be used as a tax-preparation aid.  Finally, for 
         those users with various income categories, similar analysis 
         can be performed on deposits.  In fact, Budget is so flexible 
         that small businesses can use it to record and analyze sales 
         and expenses.  And oh yes, Budget does incredibly simplify 
         reconciling your bank statement and checkbook balance.


                                 Version 3.20

              Many new features have been incorporated into version 
         3.20 of Budget.  In addition, bugs uncovered in previous ver-
         sions have been corrected.  However, users of Budget versions 
         earlier than 2.00 must convert the data files EXPENSES.NAM, 
         DEPOSITS.NAM and CHECK.DAT to the version 3.20 format.  To do 
         this, copy the conversion program BUDCON.COM onto the disk 
         which contains your Budget data files.  Then from DOS type 
         Budcon, followed by RETURN.  Budcon will automatically con-
         vert your data files to the new format.  If you have not used 
         versions earlier than 2.00, DO NOT run Budcon.  Version 3.20 
         is compatible with 2.00, and so users of that version should 
         not run Budcon.


                                Getting Started

              Budget is completely menu-driven, so it is quite easy to 
         learn.  It is also extremely flexible, but this means that 
         you must customize it for you own use by defining the various 


                                       5



         expenses and deposits categories.  Each time you record a 
         check or a deposit, you must assign it to a category.  Your 
         expenses categories, for example, might include mortgage, 
         electric, newspaper, credit cards, etc.  You may also desig-
         nate various deposits categories for various sources of in-
         come:  husband's employment, wife's employment, tax refunds, 
         self-employment, etc.  You will need to define these cate-
         gories the first time you run the program.

              It is a good idea to maintain a disk exclusively for 
         your Budget program files.  That way, as you record more 
         items and the files in which they are stored grow larger, you 
         won't risk running out of disk space.  So before you begin, 
         if you have not already done so, copy all the Budget files 
         from your Home Management II distribution disk onto a newly 
         formatted blank disk.  If you have a hard disk, you should 
         create a subdirectory just for your Budget files.  The fol-
         lowing files should all be copied.


          BUDGET.COM
          EXPENSES.NAM
          DEPOSITS.NAM
          CHECK.DAT
          BANK.DAT
          CODE.DAT


              The file BUDGET.COM contains the main program, 
         EXPENSES.NAM and DEPOSITS.NAM will contain your expenses and 
         deposits category names (for the default account), respec-
         tively, and CHECK.DAT and BANK.DAT will contain your expenses 
         and deposits entries, respectively for the default account.  
         CODE.DAT will contain your password should you choose to en-
         code your data, which, by the way, you probably should.

              After all six files have copied, place your new Budget 
         working disk in the logged drive.  You will also want to keep 
         a backup copy of this disk, since it will contain all the in-
         formation you enter.  Budget does not automatically make 
         backup copies of data files, as WordStar and many other word 
         processors do.  Since sometimes an entire disk can become 
         scrambled, backup copies of files on the same disk as the 
         originals are worse than useless, because they may create a 
         false sense of security.  Make sure you keep a backup disk -- 
         and this should not be your Home Management II distribution 
         disk -- which you update after every session with Budget.  We 
         cannot overemphasize the importance of this habit, especially 
         since it concerns your financial records.

              To begin the program, type BUDGET.  After it has loaded, 
         you will first be asked to install the program.  To do this 
         you must answer only one question.  If you are using an IBM 
         or a compatible, type 2 in response to the question.  This 
         will cause Budget to write directly to video memory, and 
         screen updates will be very fast.  If, however, you use a 
         Sanyo 550/555, Tandy 2000, or other computer that is not ful-
         ly IBM-compatible, type 1.  This will cause Budget to write 
         to the screen through DOS.  Screen updates will be slower, 
         but Budget will run flawlessly on your computer.  Once you 


                                       6



         answer this question, a new file (BUDFIG.DAT) will be cre-
         ated, and Budget will not ask you again to install the pro-
         gram.  Therefore, if you install the program for a fully IBM-
         compatible computer, and you then discover that the display 
         doesn't work properly (usually a blank screen), exit the pro-
         gram, delete the file BUDFIG.DAT, start Budget again, and in-
         stall it correctly.

              Next, you will be asked if the currently logged date is 
         correct.  If it is not, enter N.  Enter the month, day, and 
         year, SEPARATED BY COMMAS (not dashes).  For example, August 
         1, 1987 should be entered as 8,1,87.  If the information is 
         not in entered in this format it must be reentered.  Press 
         RETURN, confirm that the date is correct, and press Y.  If it 
         is not correct, press N and you'll be given another chance.

              Next the main menu will be displayed.  Since we want to 
         define your expenses and deposits categories, press 4.  Se-
         lect either Expenses or Deposits Categories.  Each current 
         category name (they will be blank at this point) will be dis-
         played, followed by a prompt asking for the new name.  Type 
         in the new name exactly as you want it to appear, but none 
         may be longer than 18 characters.  Press RETURN.  You may de-
         fine up to 53 expenses categories (the 54th is reserved for 
         totaling all expenses categories), although you may leave as 
         many blank as you wish.  Continue until you have defined as 
         many categories as you want.  If you have less than 53 ex-
         penses categories to name, at the prompt following your last 
         entry, type RETURN.  Your entries will be stored, and then 
         you should proceed to define your deposits categories.  Fol-
         low exactly the same procedure here, except that there are 
         only 29 possible categories to name, with the 30th again re-
         served for totals.

              Later you may want to modify existing categories or, if 
         you have any blank ones remaining, add new ones.  For any 
         category you wish to leave unchanged, press RETURN only at 
         the prompt.  If you modify your categories later, remember 
         that you'll also have to modify the check or deposit entries 
         originally included in that category so that they may be ac-
         curately analyzed.  To delete a category, at the prompt press 
         the space bar, followed by RETURN.

              It's a good idea to decide on your categories and write 
         them down before you attempt to define them in the program.  
         Careful planning now may save reorganization later.  Also, 
         plan your categories especially with taxes in mind.  All 
         types of tax deductible items, for example, such as chari-
         table contributions, state and local taxes, employee business 
         expenses, etc., should receive their own categories.  Then at 
         the end of the year these items will be separately totaled, 
         making it easier to fill out your tax forms.  Also, use one 
         category for recording bank charges, and make sure you keep 
         automatic payments from your account in mind as well.

              Remember that at the beginning of a new year you will 
         want to begin Budget again from the start.  It's best to keep 
         one Budget disk, with all seven files on it, for each year of 
         record-keeping, or alternatively, open a new  account for 
         each year on the same disk.  If you don't do this the pur-


                                       7



         poses of the program will largely be defeated, since it sorts 
         entries by month.


                               Entering Deposits

              To enter deposits, from the main menu type 2.  A second 
         menu will appear (the "Data Menu").  Type 2, and you will be 
         all set to enter more deposits.  For each deposit you will be 
         asked the month, amount and category of the deposit.  Enter 
         the information, and when you are finished press RETURN only 
         at the following prompt.  Your entries will be stored, and 
         you will be returned to the data menu.

              If you enter duplicate deposits, Budget automatically 
         flags them and asks if you want to delete either one or re-
         tain both.  If you wish to correct an erroneous entry, there 
         are two ways to do it.  First, you may let the incorrect in-
         formation stand and correct it later.  To to this, from the 
         data menu type 3, and you will be asked the date, amount and 
         category of the entry you wish to correct.  Budget will lo-
         cate the erroneous entry, display it on the screen, and 
         prompt you for the correct information.  Or you can correct 
         the data as you enter it.  To do this, press the up arrow key 
         on the numeric keyboard until the cursor is on the line with 
         the incorrect entry.  Then retype the correct information.  
         To backspace on the same line, press the DEL key (not the 
         BACKSPACE key) the required number of times.

              If you are entering deposits for the first time, your 
         first entry should be the amount in your checking account im-
         mediately preceding the first check you will record.  For ex-
         ample, suppose the first check you will enter is number 256.  
         Your first deposit entry should then be the amount of your 
         checkbook balance just before you wrote that check.

              The screen will display only 15 deposit categories at 
         one time.  To view categories 16-30, at any of the prompts 
         enter RETURN.  To view categories 1-15 again enter RETURN.  A 
         category name and number need not be displayed to be entered; 
         they are displayed simply for your convenience in remembering 
         them.


                                Entering Checks

              Entering checks is quite similar to entering deposits.  
         From the main menu, type 1.  The data menu will appear; type 
         2.  For each check you must enter check number, month, amount 
         and category.  After you've entered all your checks, press 
         RETURN only at the following prompt.  Your entries will be 
         stored, and you will be returned to the data menu.

              To correct errors, again you have two choices.  The 
         first one is to correct the entry as you are entering it, 
         using the the up arrow key and the DEL key as when correcting 
         deposits entries.  The second is to correct it later.  To do 
         this, from the data menu enter 3.  You will be asked the 
         check number to be corrected.  After you've entered this in-
         formation, Budget will locate the erroneous entry, display it 


                                         8



         on the screen, and prompt you for the correct information.  
         Budget also will automatically flag duplicate checks and dis-
         play them, asking you to delete one or both.

              Remember to enter all bank charges and automatic pay-
         ments deducted from your account.  You must assign a check 
         number to each of these too (since Budget uses these number 
         for sorting purposes), so assign numbers here that none of 
         your checks already has.  The same holds for cash payments 
         that you may wish to enter.  If you want to split a payment 
         between two categories, the best way to do it is to assign 
         part of the payment to the actual check number and the other 
         part to a fictitious number.

              Twenty-seven expenses categories will be displayed on 
         the screen at one time.  To view categories 28-54, enter 
         RETURN at any prompt.  To again view categories 1-27, enter 
         RETURN.  A category name and number need not be displayed to 
         be entered as data for an expense.


                                Analyzing Data

              To analyze your checking account data, from the main 
         menu type 1 if you want to analyze payments or 2 if you want 
         to analyze deposits.  Then from the data menu, type 1.  You 
         will be given a choice of printing some or all payment/depos-
         it entries or continuing on to your choice of category.  To 
         perform the analysis, type 2.  Next you must choose the cate-
         gory you wish to analyze.  Type the number corresponding to 
         your choice, followed by RETURN.  Monthly subtotals and year-
         ly totals to date for that category will be displayed.

              To further analyze your data, press any key.  You will 
         be presented with 5 new options, two of which permit further 
         data analysis.  Type 2 to view a list of all entries in the 
         category under analysis.  You may list the entries on the 
         screen only, or you may also request a printout.  This list 
         will show all the available information on each entry under 
         that category.  Press any key to continue.  Next, you may 
         type 3, and a bar graph will appear comparing total entries 
         in that category in each month of the year.  This is useful 
         for a quick comparison of monthly income and spending pat-
         terns in any or all categories.

              When listing checks or deposits, Budget allows you to 
         view the previous screenful of checks or deposits, as well as 
         the first screenful and the last.  When listing either checks 
         or deposits, to view the previous screen, press PG UP at the 
         prompt.  To view the first screenful of checks or deposits, 
         press HOME (7 on the numeric keypad).  To view the last 
         screenful, press END (1 on the numeric keypad).

              Special note to Sanyo 550/555 users:  To view the last 
         screenful of checks, do not press LF (1 on the numeric key-
         pad).  This executes a line feed and causes problems for the 
         display.  Instead, press the down arrow (5 on the keypad).

              To analyze data in a different category, type 1.  Follow 
         the above steps for data analysis on this new category.


                                       9



              Budget is designed to display your spending and income 
         patterns clearly so that you may easily analyze your finan-
         cial affairs and plan accordingly.  It allows you to see 
         where your money is coming from and where it is going, and 
         when.  This facilitates more informed decisions regarding 
         your finances and, if used carefully, may even assist in de-
         termining how and where you can save.  You may be surprised 
         to discover where you are actually spending some of your mon-
         ey and where greater economy is possible.


                               Printout Options

              To assist in data analysis Budget permits several print-
         out options.  First, you may print a list of total entries by 
         month in some or all deposits or expenses categories.  To do 
         so, from the data menu type 1.  At the next prompt, type 1 
         again.  You must tell Budget how many categories you want 
         printed, 1 to 54 for expenses, 1 to 30 for deposits.  The 
         categories will always be printed starting with the first one 
         and continuing through the number you specify.  Make sure 
         your printer is ready to go. If you'll be printing more than 
         4 categories, the program will wait for you to press a key 
         after every fourth category is printed.  This allows you to 
         insert a new sheet of paper if you are not using continuous 
         form paper.  The printout will list total entries in each 
         month in the categories selected.  Upon completion of this 
         you will be returned to the main menu.

              You may also print a list of all entries for the year in 
         any category.  To do this, from the data menu type 1, and 
         then type 2 at the following prompt.  Enter your choice of 
         category, press  RETURN, and the listing of entries in that 
         category for each month will be displayed.  Press any key to 
         continue.  Now you are given 5 options again.  Type 2.  Make 
         sure your printer is ready to go, and type P.  will receive a 
         printout and screen listing of all entries for that category.

              Finally, you may also print a list of outstanding 
         checks.  For instructions on how to do this consult the sec-
         tion of this manual on reconciling your bank statement.


                             Checking Your Balance

              To check your current balance, from the main menu type 
         3.  The sum of all your deposits and the sum of your checks 
         will appear on the screen, followed by your balance.  Press 
         any key to return to the main menu.  This option is most use-
         ful after you've reconciled your bank statement and you want 
         to make sure the balance listed in your checkbook is correct.


                        Reconciling Your Bank Statement

              One of Budget's nicest features is that it allows you to 
         painlessly and quickly reconcile your bank statement and 
         checkbook balance.  Because the program flags outstanding 
         checks and automatically determines your actual account bal-
         ance (the figure on your statement) and your true balance 


                                      10



         (the figure in your checkbook), most of the work involved in 
         this dreaded chore is handled with ease.  Budget does not 
         simply duplicate on the screen what you could do on paper 
         (like some programs do).  Rather, it handles 90% of the job 
         itself.

              Before you attempt to reconcile your bank statement, 
         make sure you have entered every check, deposit, automatic 
         payment and bank charge affecting your account. Bank charges 
         and automatic payments must be assigned a check number.  
         Choose numbers for them, say from 1 to 100, that will not be 
         assigned to checks.  Do not attempt to reconcile your account 
         until you are sure all payments and deposits have been re-
         corded.

              After you have recorded all payments and deposits, from 
         the main menu enter 6.  Budget will select those checks still 
         outstanding and present them to you one at a time.  With your 
         bank statement in front of you, verify that each check has 
         cleared.  You may want to mark off each check on your state-
         ment as you go.  For each check that has not cleared, enter 
         N.  For each check that has cleared enter Y.  Please do this 
         carefully, for if you tell Budget that a check has cleared 
         when it has not, you cannot go back and change it.  On the 
         other hand, if you miss one, and tell Budget that it has not 
         cleared when it has, you can go back later and report it 
         cleared by running through the whole procedure again.

              Next Budget will list all your outstanding checks.  You 
         may also request a printout of these, which is a good idea 
         especially if you have more than 22 of them, since in that 
         case the first ones will scroll right off the screen.  Com-
         pare this list with your checkbook to make sure they agree.  
         When finished, press any key to continue.

              After you've finished with this, you must enter all out-
         standing deposits.  You may enter as many as 20 of these, one 
         at a time.  Budget will prompt you.  After you've entered all 
         outstanding deposits, press RETURN only at the following 
         prompt.

              Finally, the total dollar amount of outstanding checks 
         and outstanding deposits will appear on the screen, followed 
         by your actual account balance.  This figure should agree 
         with the ending balance shown on your bank statement.  Remem-
         ber that your actual balance shown will not agree with the 
         balance shown in your checkbook unless you have no out-
         standing checks and deposits.  In addition, remember that 
         your actual balance will not be equal to your outstanding de-
         posits minus outstanding checks.


                 What to do if Your Bank Statement and Actual
                              Balance Don't Agree

              If the figures don't agree, check the following:

              1. Did you record all deposits?
              2. Did you record all checks, automatic payments and 
                 bank charges?


                                      11



              3. Have any checks cleared that Budget has as outstand-
                 ing?
              4. Are any checks outstanding that Budget has as 
                 cleared?
              5. Did you list the outstanding deposits correctly?
              6. Do the amounts listed on your statement for each 
                 check and deposit agree with your records?

              If there are no errors in any of these six areas, check 
         with your bank to make sure they haven't made any errors.  
         Also, remember that you still must double-check the arithme-
         tic in your checkbook.  No program can do that for you.

              After you've finished reconciling your bank statement, 
         check the balance in your checkbook and your balance recorded 
         in Budget to make sure they agree.


                                 Encoding Data

              Budget allows you to encode your expenses and deposits 
         data for all accounts so that no one but you has access to
	 that information.  All entries are stored in the files
	 CHECK.DAT and BANK.DAT (for the dafault account), and if
	 these files are not encoded anyone can list on the computer
	 screen the information contained in them, and the files can
	 also be printed.  And both of these can be done without ac-
	 cess to the main program itself.  But encoding the data not
	 only makes it unreadable by the main program, it also makes
	 it appear as gibberish on the screen and prevents printing it.
	 To be useful it must be decoded, and you will select a secret
	 password so that you alone are able to decode it.

              To encode the data, from the main menu type 5.  At the 
         next menu prompt type 1.  Your data will be encoded.  To de-
         code it, type 2 at the prompt.  If you have not selected a 
         password, you will be asked to do so.  Choose a four-numeral 
         password (3333, 4297, etc.), and enter it, followed by 
         RETURN.  For security reasons your password will not appear 
         on the screen as you type it.  Also, the first time you enter 
         a password you will be asked to verify it by entering it a 
         second time.  Once you've selected your password, you must 
         enter it to decode your data.  It's best to select a password 
         even if you're not sure you will use this feature.  But make 
         sure you either remember your password, or better yet, write 
         it down and keep it at work or someplace other than with your 
         computer paraphernalia.

              Note:  If you cannot remember your password, a program 
                     is available from MVP Software that will recover 
                     it for you.  To receive this program send a blank 
                     SS formatted disk, plus a $5.00 shipping and 
                     handling fee, or send $8.00 and no disk, to MVP 
                     Software.  Request the "Budget password recovery" 
                     program.

              To change your password, enter * at the prompt asking 
         for the old password.  You will be asked to enter your old 
         one (so the program is sure that you are making the change) 
         and choose a new one.  Make sure you then remember the new 


                                      12



         one.


                            Using Multiple Accounts

              Version 3.20 allows you to use as many accounts as you 
         would like.  This is especially useful if you have multiple 
         checking accounts or different people use the program on the 
         same computer.  You also may use this feature to open a new 
         account for each new year.  All new accounts that you create
	 can be encoded.

              To select an alternative account, from the main menu se-
         lect 7.  You will be asked to choose (or name) a new account 
         by entering filenames for both the expenses and deposits data 
         files.  The filenames you choose must be eight or less char-
         acters long and must not have an extension.  Budget will sup-
         ply the extension for you.  To select the default account 
         files (BANK.DAT and CHECK.DAT), simply press RETURN at the 
         prompts.

              Once you select your new account, you will be returned 
         to the main menu.  Notice that your new filenames are listed 
         at the top of the screen as the logged accounts.  All proces-
         sing will now be done using those files.  Remember that the 
         first thing that you should do when opening a new account for 
         the first time is define your expenses and deposits catego-
         ries.

              You may switch back and forth between accounts as many 
         times as you like within a Budget work session.


                                Exiting Budget

              Budget may be exited at any time by pressing Function 
         Key 1, or by entering 8 from the main menu.  Pressing F1 re-
         turns you to DOS, but this allows Budget to remain in memory.  
         For this feature to work correctly the file COMMAND.COM from 
         your system disk must be present on your Budget disk.  You 
         may then run any other program and return to Budget simply by 
         entering EXIT RETURN at the DOS prompt.  However, use caution 
         when doing this.  Never exit Budget until all data is proper-
         ly written to disk.  And remember that when the program re-
         mains memory-resident this uses more than 90K of memory.  Ex-
         iting by entering 8 from the main menu removes Budget from 
         memory.


                                Error Messages

              There are two types of error messages you may encounter 
         in running Budget.  The first is "Budget overlay file(s) not 
         found.  Program terminated."  This means that one or more of 
         the files EXPENSES.NAM, DEPOSITS.NAM, CODE.DAT, CHECK.DAT, 
         BANK.DAT or a new file you have created is not on the disk in 
         the logged drive.  Correct the problem and restart Budget.

              You also may run into a "Bad file data" error.  When 
         this happens it is due to one of two problems.  The first 


                                      12



         one, and the worst, is that your data files (CHECK.DAT and 
         BANK.DAT for the default account) have become corrupted.  
         Copy the data files from your backup disks onto your working 
         Budget disk.  The other cause of this message is not so seri-
         ous.  To encode your data files, you must have made at least 
         several data entries into both your expenses and deposits 
         categories.  Do not attempt to encode your data files until 
         you have done so.  If you do, you will get this error mes-
         sage.


                     What to do if You Encounter Problems

              If questions or problems arise in using Budget, first 
         get as clear as you can on the precise nature of the problem:  
         Where in the program does it occur?  What were you doing when 
         it occurred?  What do you think might be causing it?  Consult 
         your Home Management II user's manual first to resolve the 
         problem.  If no help is forthcoming there, call or write MVP 
         Software.  If we cannot solve your problem immediately, we 
         will contact you as soon as possible with the solution, 
         usually within a few days.  We are a service-oriented com-
         pany, and we want 100% customer satisfaction.

              If you have suggestions for improvements in Budget or 
         any other Home Management II programs, drop us a note.  We 
         are continually improving our products, and remember that as 
         a customer you are entitled to any new versions of Home Man-
         agement II at 50% off the price of the upgraded package.  If, 
         however, we incorporate any significant suggestions which you 
         are the first to make, you will be entitled to the new up-
         grade free (if you have already purchased the previous ver-
         sion).

              We are serious about being responsive to the needs of 
         our customers.





                                  TYPEWRITER

              Useful for filling out forms, writing short notes, or 
         whenever you don't want to fire up a full-scale word pro-
         cessing program, Typewriter is quite simple to operate.  You 
         set margins and spacing (single, double or triple) between 
         lines only, and for these Typewriter will prompt you.  Enter 
         data just as you would on your typewriter. Since your input 
         is not sent to the printer until you press RETURN, Typewriter 
         functions much like a memory typewriter, allowing you to make 
         corrections before printing.  Corrections must be made before 
         the data is sent to the printer.  To correct an error, delete 
         the erroneous data using the backspace key, and retype the 
         line from that point.  When you are finished, hit ESC to ter-
         minate the program and return to the operating system.

              Before using Typewriter turn on your printer and put in 
         a piece of paper.  If you are using a daisy wheel printer, 
         make sure your paper is set at the initial print position, 


                                      13



         and make sure that the spacing switch is properly set and the 
         proper daisy wheel is in place.  You will notice that Type-
         writer does not have many features found on a regular Type-
         writer.  For example, it has no tabs or margin release.  The 
         program is designed to be used primarily to fill out forms 
         and write short notes.  For anything more involved you would 
         probably want to use a word processor anyway.  Since the pri-
         mary purpose of Typewriter is to save time and type short 
         items, we have kept extra features to a minimum.  This means 
         that to use it there is practically nothing you have to re-
         member.

              The ruler line at the top of the page tells how much you 
         have typed on a line and how much more you can type.  When 
         you reach the right margin no more characters will be en-
         tered.  If you fail to catch an error until after it has al-
         ready been printed, move the paper back to the line in which 
         the error occurred, space over to the spot directly beneath 
         the error, and type the correct letter(s).  Do not retype 
         anything other than the incorrect characters.  Press RETURN.  
         The correct letters will be then be printed.  Of course you 
         must blank out the incorrect characters with correction fluid 
         before printing the correct ones.

              To change the margins or spacing without exiting Type-
         writer, press CTRL - A.





                        PERSONAL BUDGET PLANNING (PBP)

              One of the most important, and most neglected, areas of 
         personal financial planning is constructing an accurate, 
         workable budget.  The difficulties include the complexity of 
         the task, remembering all the various categories of expenses, 
         allocating money to each category, and the mathematical cal-
         culations involved, among other things.  PBP prompts you 
         through this task and does most of the work for you.  It is 
         easiest to describe how the program works by running through 
         each of its steps.


                       Step 1 -- select budgeting period

              You will be asked to select a budgeting period from the 
         following four options:  1 - weekly, 2 - biweekly, 3 - semi-
         monthly, 4 - monthly.  Select the period that most readily 
         lends itself to budgetary planning.  This may be according to 
         how you are paid, so that if you receive paychecks twice a 
         month, for example, you may want to select 3.  On the other 
         hand, you may have quite a few monthly expenses, such as rent 
         or mortgage, electric, gas, phone, loan payments, etc., and 
         so a monthly budgeting period may be more appropriate.  In 
         any case, select the option with which you can work the easi-
         est.  The program will automatically extrapolate for you over 
         a year's time.




                                      14



                               Step 2 -- income

              You will be asked to enter your income for the budgetary 
         period you have selected.  At each prompt, enter the appro-
         priate amount in dollars, without commas.  First enter gross 
         salary/wages for your budgeting period, then enter other in-
         come.  If you have quarterly or yearly income, estimate how 
         much of it you receive in a budgeting period, and enter that.  
         Make sure you enter interest, investment returns and the 
         like.


                         Step 3 -- paycheck deductions

              Enter the following paycheck deductions:  federal income 
         tax, state and local tax, social security, unemployment in-
         surance, health insurance, life insurance, contributions and 
         other deductions.  Again enter dollar amounts only and use no 
         commas.  For each entry of zero, simply press RETURN.


                           Step 4 -- fixed expenses

              Expenses are divided into two categories:  fixed and 
         variable.  Fixed expenses are those that are the same when 
         each payment is due.  Make sure these are entered accurately.  
         Fixed expenses include rent/mortgage, life insurance, health 
         insurance, house insurance, auto insurance, car payments, 
         loan payments, trash removal, cable TV and other fixed 
         expenses.

              Following step four you will be shown your totals so 
         far, including spendable income, which is the amount of money 
         remaining after paycheck deductions and fixed expenses are 
         subtracted from your gross income.  Press P when you are 
         ready to continue to variable expenses.


                          Step 5 -- variable expenses

              This is where the rubber hits the road in planning your 
         budget, since this is where careful planning is most effec-
         tive in saving money.  Most of us can't do much about the 
         categories of income, paycheck deductions and fixed expenses, 
         but most of us can control variable expenses better than we 
         actually do.  It is here that PBP is most effective.

              It works like this.  In the first round you will be 
         asked to enter figures for many variable expenses categories.  
         Don't be too concerned with accuracy in this round; just take 
         a good guess if you aren't sure of the actual amount.  How-
         ever, don't enter zero unless you are sure you spend nothing 
         in that category over the whole year.  Later on, when you re-
         fine your guesses, any category in which a zero is entered 
         will be eliminated.  Thus if you have doubts, enter at least 
         $1.

              After the final entry, you will be given your total var-
         iable expenses for the first round, your total spendable in-
         come, and the difference.  Press P to begin round two.


                                      15



              In round two you will be given the chance to refine your 
         budget.  The difference between your spendable income and 
         variable expenses has been prorated over all the remaining 
         categories of variable expenses (i.e, those with entries 
         greater than zero).  For each category, the amount presently 
         recorded for it will be displayed, and you will be asked if 
         it is correct.  If it is, press Y.  If not, press N.  Then 
         enter the correct amount.  You will be asked if you want this 
         `account' (category) frozen at that amount.  Press Y only if 
         you are sure the amount is correct.  Doing so removes it from 
         further refinement, and so you will not be able to make 
         changes.  If you aren't sure, press N.  This process will 
         continue for all categories with entries greater than zero.

              Round 3 is the same as round 2.  Continue with this pro-
         cess until all accounts are frozen.  Note that all of your 
         income must be accounted for.  Think realistically, and put 
         any excess in savings.  Sometimes PBP will prorate money over 
         accounts in a rather odd fashion.  If this happens, simply 
         enter the correct data.

              Following is a list of the variable expense categories:  
         food/ beverage, clothing, dry cleaning, barber/beauty, home 
         maintenance, home heat, water, electricity, telephone, 
         gas/oil, auto maintenance, fares/tolls/parking, dentist, phy-
         sician, drugs/sundries, school expenses, family allowance, 
         clubs/lodges, theater/sports, restaurants, other entertain-
         ment, mags./books/papers, sitters, childcare, vacation 
         savings, IRA, other savings, contributions and other expen-
         ses.


                               Step 6 -- results

              You will be given a detailed listing (printout optional) 
         of your budget and a bar graph (printout optional) of percen-
         tage of income each expense requires.  To analyze your bud-
         get, request a printout, since the information scrolls off 
         the screen rather rapidly.





                                   QUIK LOAN

              With Quik Loan you can easily list, print and amortize 
         loans, and with a few keystrokes change loan values for com-
         parison.  You must first enter the interest rate of the loan, 
         the number of payments per year, the number of years and the 
         loan principal.  Use no commas in your entries.

              You will then be given the periodic payment amount.  If 
         you want an amortized listing, press Y at the following 
         prompt.  You may also request a printout of this listing.  
         The listing may be suspended at any point by pressing the 
         space bar.  Otherwise it will continue until it reaches the 
         end.  After the listing is completed you will be told the to-
         tal amount of all payments and the amount of the final pay-
         ment, which is usually different from the amount of the other 


                                      16



         monthly payments.

              Now you may change loan values for comparison.  You may 
         change the interest rate, number of years, number of payments 
         per year, amount of the loan, or you may continue with the 
         same loan values or exit Quik Loan.  To change any loan val-
         ue, press the appropriate key.  Enter the new amount and 
         press RETURN.  When you have changed all the values you wish 
         to, press C.  You will then be given information on your new 
         loan.





                                 STOCK BROKER

              Investing in stocks is often exciting and, one hopes, 
         profitable.  But it also can be difficult to keep track of a 
         sizable portfolio.  Stock Broker helps you do just that.  It 
         evolved over a period of six years during which the author 
         was developing it as a tool to maintain records on his own 
         security investments -- records that should make buy/sell de-
         cisions easier and more intelligent.


                          What Does Stock Broker Do?

              When the program first loads, the initial screen asks 
         you to insert your data disk.  All of the main program loads 
         into memory, so once it is running all disk reads and writes 
         are for data.  If you are maintaining a separate disk for 
         Stock Broker (we recommend this), or if you are using a hard 
         disk, ignore this request.  If you keep a separate data disk, 
         insert it now into the logged drive.

              Once you enter data, Stock Broker will produce printouts 
         and analysis on screen.  These are of two sorts:

         (1) First, it identifies each security by name, stock ex-
             change code, total number of shares held, total cost and 
             the annual dividend rate per share.  It also summarizes 
             the following information:  total number of shares, total 
             cost and total annual dividend income.

         (2) Second, it identifies each security by stock exchange 
             code, the current market price per share, the market val-
             ue -- taking into account a brokerage commission for the 
             sale, and the annual dividend in dollars and as a percen-
             tage of market value.  Summary data are provided for the 
             total number of shares, the total cost, the net total 
             gain or loss, the number of holdings worth less than 
             cost, the loss if only those holdings were sold, the to-
             tal annual dividend income and the cash reserve.


                              What Must the User Do?

                  Stock Broker is menu driven and easy to use.  First, 
             you must enter all relevant data concerning your current 


                                        17



             portfolio.  The program will prompt you through this 
             task.

                  After that, on a regular basis (we recommend week-
             ly), you must update your data, again following the menu.  
             For a portfolio of about 35 stocks this takes no more 
             than 15 minutes, since updated information includes only 
             (1) the date, (2) the Dow Jones Industrial Index, and for 
             each stock, (3) the market price.  The program will then 
             give you the new information detailed above in printouts 
             and on-screen analysis.

                  In addition, whenever you acquire or dispose of a 
             security and whenever a capital gains dividend (but not 
             an income dividend) is distributed, appropriate changes 
             in the stock inventory as well as corresponding changes 
             in the cash reserve must be entered.  Stock dividends and 
             income dividend changes must also be recorded in the ap-
             propriate records.

                  The idea here is that the investor starts with a 
             fixed investment package made up of securities of vari-
             able market value, plus a cash reserve (usually a money 
             market fund or a bank account) of fixed dollar value.  
             Any purchase of sale of securities and any capital gains 
             distribution will change the cash reserve by the amount 
             involved in each case.


                    What Information Will Stock Broker Provide?

                  For each security, the summary printout indicates 
             the market price trend expressed as percent change -- an 
             indication of the price pattern.  It also indicates the 
             net gain or loss as a percent of cost, the annual div-
             idend dollar income to be expected, and that income ex-
             pressed as a percent of market value.  The summary data 
             shows which securities are worth less now than they were 
             at purchase and the maximum loss if only those securities 
             were sold.

                  Stock Broker also calculates your personal Stock In-
             dex (SI).  This unique feature is the following ratio:


                  (cash reserve) + (market value of securities)
             SI = ---------------------------------------------
                     (Dow Jones Industrial Index) x (Factor)


                  The Factor is automatically calculated when the data 
             for the portfolio are first entered and after the arbi-
             trary cash reserve is designated.  Ideally the initial 
             Stock Index is set at 100.00.  After that the Stock Index 
             will vary, depending on the relative movement of the num-
             erator versus the denominator and will reflect the acumen 
             of the investor measured against the moving index of the 
             Dow Jones Industrials.

                  Since it is clear that changes in security markets 


                                        18



             does not affect the cash reserve, the reserve should be 
             kept low if one believes the market in general is about 
             to rise, and vice versa.  The cash reserve is established 
             at the outset and could be set at zero, or even at a neg-
             ative number should the investment strategy be to acquire 
             securities on margin.  Changes in one's Stock Index 
             should force the investor to review his investment stra-
             tegy every time he updates his portfolio.  In other 
             words, your Stock Index, measured against the Dow Jones 
             Industrial Index, will tell you whether you are doing 
             better than the DJI, or whether you are doing worse.

                  But to maintain the validity of the formula it is 
             essential that any purchase or sale of securities, or any 
             capital gain distribution, be reflected in a correspond-
             ing change in the cash reserve.

                  In estimating market values of securities, it is 
             customary to multiply the market price per share by the 
             number of shares owned.  However, this does not give a 
             realistic value, as it ignores the brokerage sales com-
             mission.  Stock Broker permits the investor to select an 
             average value for the sales commission, measured as a 
             percentage of the "market value."  A figure of 2.5% is a 
             good estimate for a full service brokerage house (al-
             though some may charge more) handling small trades, while 
             1% is usually a good estimate for a discount broker.  If 
             the investor acts as his own broker, or if he wishes not 
             to figure in the commission, he may enter zero for this 
             figure.


                                   Menu Options

                  After the stock data file has been loaded from disk, 
             a menu appears with several options.


             1. Enter New Stock Prices
             2. Review Data on Screen
             3. Proceed to Summaries
             4. Save Data to Disk
             5. Correct any Data Entries
             6. Delete a Holding
             7. Insert a New Holding
             8. Add a Capital Gain Distribution Dividend
             9. Print Basic Stock Inventory
             10. Return to Main Menu


                  1. provides for updating the market prices.  The new 
             prices will be compared with those in the file selected, 
             either the previous week, the start of the month or year, 
             or any base data.

                  2. provides for a review either of the data recov-
             ered from disk, or after new data are entered.  First it 
             prints to screen all of the entered data.  After that it 
             provides for a detailed review of any security, which 
             will be identified by its sequence number.


                                        19



                  3. makes all of the summary calculations and then 
             gives the user an option to print a hardcopy.  After en-
             tering new price data the user should perform this op-
             tion.

                  4. saves the new data to disk.  This option must be 
             performed before Stock Broker is terminated or the new 
             data will not be saved.

                  5. is a provision to correct any entry; for changes 
             in a specific holding a submenu is offered.

                  6. and 7. handle total changes in specific invest-
             ment holdings.  But if only a part of a holding is sold, 
             or if an addition is made to an existing holding, this 
             should be treated as a correction to an entry and entered 
             using 5. above.

                  8. requires an addition to the cash reserve by the 
             amount of the capital gain distribution.

                  9. provides for an inventory printout.

                  Additional submenus are generated whenever appropri-
             ate to facilitate program use.  The choices in these are 
             explained on screen as the program is running.  To exit 
             the program, you must always return to the main menu.  
             Never turn off your computer until after you exit the 
             program.  Failure to do this will cause loss of data.

                  Three sample Stock Broker data files are provided on 
             your Home Management II distribution diskettes.  These 
             are TEST1.STO, TEST2.STO and TEST3.STO (all Stock Broker 
             data files are automatically given a .STO extension).  We 
             recommend that you become familiar wth the program by 
             practicing on these before you enter your own data.
