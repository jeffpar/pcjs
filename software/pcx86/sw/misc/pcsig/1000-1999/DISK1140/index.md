## Information about "INTERNATIONAL GAME COLLECTION"

    PC PONTOON is a memory-resident blackjack type game with a few twists
    on the old classic.
    
    The game is based on the original classic pontoon or blackjack,
    whichever you want to call it.  From Ireland, it diverges from American
    casino blackjack in several significant ways.  Like conventional casino
    blackjack, the object of the game is to get 21 or less, but PC PONTOON
    is for one player only.  Some other rules of the game: if you and the
    computer get the same value, then the computer wins that game; Pontoon
    (blackjack, a natural) beats any other hands; a five-card trick beats
    all other hands except for Pontoon; and if both players go over 21
    (bust) then both bets are returned.
    
    PRINCE lets you rule your very own kingdom.  Make decisions on how to
    rule it and face the consequences.
    
    You have just inherited a small domain somewhere in the boundless tracks
    of central Asia.  Each year you meet with your royal council and decide
    how many acres of land to cultivate, how much grain to reserve in the
    storehouses, and how much additional grain to buy or sell.  Gold
    acquired from trade is needed to maintain your loyal troops, which can
    be used to defend your territory or to conquer new territory to
    accomodate an expanding populace.  You can also send scouting parties to
    get information about the strength and potential threat of your
    surrounding neighbors.  Above all, the main objective during your term
    is to build an irrigation system to guard against drought and make your
    crops more productive.
    
    When making your decisions you must be careful not to tax your citizens
    too highly, since they might starve or grow rebellious.  On the other
    hand, if you tax them too low, there may not be enough grain for
    planting crops next year.  At the end of the year, your officers report
    to you a summary of the year's important events, such as harvest yields,
    balance in the treasury, population count, effects of drought or plague,
    territory captured, and information on the developments of any invasions
    from surrounding territories.  The kingdom is in your hands.  If you do
    well you will be honored, but if you do poorly you can always abdicate.
    
    BALL CATCHER is a game where the object is to catch balls with a basket.
    A basket is moved below columns using the number keys one to eight.
    Balls move down columns called tubes slowly at first, but increasingly
    more rapidly.  Every ball caught by the basket scores a point, and
    missing a ball registers a fault.  A round ends when eight faults are
    accumulated, or the time allowed in seconds has elapsed.  Points are
    determined by completed rounds versus the number of faults.
