## Information about "CHEQUE-IT-OUT 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1560)"

    Quicker than "Quicken," more intuitive than "Intuit," CHEQUE-IT-OUT is
    the choice for everyone who wants to do more than just balance their
    checkbooks. Here at last is a complete personal bookkeeping system that
    doesn't expect you to be an accountant to use it. Nor does it treat you
    like a child in its well thought out explanations of how to keep track
    of your finances, balance the books and generate impressive statements
    of net worth, profit and loss, etc., -- guaranteed to impress your
    banker or accountant.
    
    The double-entry financial system creates financial reports, and
    tracks income and expenses, assets, liabilities and budgets. It
    prints checks, both standard pin-fed and individual personal checks.
    Easy-to-follow menus and context-sensitive pop-up help screens guide you
    along, and the optional sound effects actually make doing your books
    fun! More importantly, this is a program that puts you back in charge
    of your own finances -- teaching you what you need to know to manage
    your money yourself!
