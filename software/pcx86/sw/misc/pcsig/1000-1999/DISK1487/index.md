## Information about "2FACED"

    Who wants a two-faced software program?  You do, if you want to save
    money or precious elbow room when printing files you plan to keep.
    
    2FACED allows the HP LaserJet II+ and compatibles to scrunch two pages
    of text on each side of a single 8-1/2x11 sheet of paper -- making it
    ideal for saving paper, storage space, and toner when printing hard
    copies of documentation or source code.
    
    Options let you print the filename of the text file as a header, along
    with the file's creation time and date and the time and date of the
    printing.  It also can draw a box around each page or add grey halftone
    bars which resemble the bars on fanfold computer paper.  You also get a
    count of pages reported as they print.
