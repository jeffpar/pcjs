## Information about "TOMMY'S INSULTS"

    "You Hare-Brained Import of Slimy Maggot Fodder!"  "You Premature Hamper
    of Gummy Toe Jam!"  These are just a taste of the callous offenses you
    can view in TOMMY'S INSULTS.  Aliens from another world have a favorite
    pastime of trading insults to gain friendship, and they want to teach
    you their customs.  A rather odd premise, but also a rather odd program.
    Although not a "player's" game (it is more like a nickelodeon), it does
    offer the user uncounted thousands of insults ranging from the gross to
    the absurd.
    
    While viewing, enjoy the many TV show tunes being played, as well as
    other jingles.  Function keys allow you to change screen and border
    colors, while the space bar allows you to freeze the current insults on
    the screen, so you can print them for future use on your friends.  Also
    supported is the Covox Speech Thing, an external speaker unit, to
    bombard your ears with insults.
    
    TOMMY'S INSULTS is not recommended for the very young -- some
    language is rated PG-13 and you have to read well to keep up with it
    all.  Do not expect any interaction with this program.  You can add
    adverbs and adjectives to the dictionary bank, but this is the only
    input you can have with the toy.  If you enjoy viewing obscure and
    ridiculous phrases, you will enjoy the program; if not, as a gift it
    would convey the same message as a can of deodorant.
