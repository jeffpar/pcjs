## Information about "A86/D86 ASSEMBLER/DEBUGGER"

    A86 is an excellent assembler that actually performs better and is
    easier to use than Microsoft's MASM 4.00.  It also assembles your
    programs a lot faster than MASM.  It lets you leave out all
    segmentation directives, if you want.  The segmentation default model is
    compatible with most high-level languages.  You can also access
    subroutines from your own libraries and, if you register, you
    receive the A86LIB tool for creating your own libraries more easily than
    with MASM.  You can use floating point operands in assembly-time
    expression arithmetic.  This is an A86 exclusive.
    
    The manual (included on the disk) is excellent.  You can learn 8086 or
    80286 Assembly language programming with it.  The debugger is great.  It
    has a floating point display window for use with the 8087 or 80287 that
    will knock your socks off.
