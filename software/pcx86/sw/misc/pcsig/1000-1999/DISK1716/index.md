## Information about "MOMSYS"

    Do you need to keep track of birthdays, anniversaries, events, and other
    re-occuring activities?  MOMSYS is the ideal program for the individual,
    small business, or organization that needs to plan and track activities
    that occur on a regular basis.
    
    Activities can be tracked on a date of the month, such as birthdays or
    anniversaries, or on a day of the week for meetings, or on a weeks of
    the year frequency for activities that occur during specific weeks.
    
    MOMSYS is menu driven and consists of three components, a detail screen
    for entering/changing/deleting an activity, an inquiry system for
    locating activities quickly, and a reports function for daily or
    calendar reports.

                                    Preface



       Momsys can be technically termed as a re-occurring activity
       scheduling program.  The fundemental purpose of Momsys was
       to create an automated system for my wife's manual card system
       of keeping track of her home activities.  Being a programmer
       and having a pc at home, she naturally wanted something of her
       own on the pc.  So thusly, I initially created a mere replication
       of her card system, which was more work than what it was worth.

       As her ideas and requests for modifications grew, I realized
       that she would need a system with more scope than what I had
       created.  So I created a new system for her with the only
       appropriate name I could think of -- MOM's SYStem or MOMSYS for
       short.

       MOMSYS can be used for many purposes beyond keeping track of
       personal activities, milestones, and events.   It can and is
       being used in small business, organizational activities,
       project control, and equipment maintenance.

       Take a look at MOMSYS, if you like it, use it, send in the
       registration, and any ideas you might have for improvements or
       modifications.  I will try to implement them in future releases
       of Momsys.

  Welcome to Momsys, The Activity Scheduling Program for IBM PCs,
  including XT, AT and PS/2 models and other 100% compatible systems.

  Momsys is an activity scheduling program which will help you to 
  plan and coordinate your activities of the day.  

  Momsys requires DOS version 3.0 or higher.

  Memory requirements are at least 155,000 free bytes.

  Before you begin, make a backup/working copy of the program diskette,
  as you would with any diskette that contains important information.

  Store the original in a safe place.


       The components of Momsys are as follows

        1.  Menu Driven - use up or down arrow keys to make
                selections.

        2.  A detail screen to allow you to add, change, inquire
                or delete individual records.

        3.  An inquiry sub-system to allow for quick location of
                individual records.

        4.  A reports sub-system consisting of a daily report
                and a calendar report.

       Note: The escape key will allow you to exit out of any
                 situation that can come about.  If in doubt, press
                 the escape key to discontinue.

What can an Activity Scheduler do for me?
-----------------------------------------

In these days and times, people are much busier than in the past.

Our family, homes, cars, jobs, recreational and organizational activities
can almost become over-burdening.  

We are often over-scheduled on events simply because of the demands of 
living in these times.  An activity scheduler can be a benefit just because
by using it will help control over-scheduling.

One cannot schedule many activities because of the asynchronous nature
of those activities.  However,  one way of getting control of your life
and the lives of those around you is to schedule what activities that
can be scheduled.  

This is the key to the benefit of using an activity scheduler.  To schedule
what you can in order to have the time and resources to accomplish what
you can't schedule.

Warning: An activity scheduler should not become a master of your life!  
The proper use of an activity scheduler in your personal life is for it
to become a documented method for you to plan your day.  So what if you
can't get it all done, at least the scheduler gave you a idea of what
you should get accomplished.  Again, one must always be subordinate to
the unscheduled but important activities in our lives.  If we could 
schedule everything in our lives, I would think that life would become
very boring.


What actvities do I need to schedule?
-------------------------------------
    
The answer to this question is not easily answered specifically because
it depends upon the circumstances of your life.  I will ,however, attempt
to explain some general areas of life to schedule.

Home -  Cooking, dishwashing, vacuuming, cleaning, pet care, recreational,
        shopping, bill paying, plants, and children activities (scouting,
        sports, school, personal, etc.)

Cars -  Oil changes, tune-ups, oil and tire checks, air conditioning checks.

Jobs -  Shift scheduling, meetings, project management, equipment maintenance,
        employee reviews, end-of-month events, end-of-year events etc.
       
Organizations -  Meetings, work assigments, fund drive scheduling


Further Information:
--------------------

There are many books on the subject of home activity scheduling.

One such book is 'Sidetracked Home Executives' by Pam Young and Peggy Jones.

Consult your local bookstore or library for more information.


;/



       Detail Screen.

       The detail screen is easy to use.  Always look at the bottom
       of the screen for the mode and the function key usage.


            Add mode.

                The add mode is where you put records into the system.

                The field of entry will always be highlighted.

                Function key 10 (f10) will terminate the add
                    and put the record in the file.

                Function key 9 (f9) will do the same as f10 but
                    will not blank the screen.  This is to allow
                    entry of multiple records of similar nature.

            Change mode.
                Same as add mode above.

       A very important field on the detail screen is the frequency
       field.  It is used to determine the frequency of the activity.
       Fields will be "opened" according to the type of frequency.

       The type of frequencies are as follows:
           D - Day of week
           M - Date of month
           W - Weeks of year

       Other important fields on the screen are the days of week,
       the weeks of month, the months of year, and the weeks of year.

       To select the proper day, week, month, or week of year enter
       any character in the appropriate field.

       Again, these fields are used in accordance with the frequency.

       Dates such as birthdays, anniversaries, etc  would use the
       Date of month frequency (M).

       The Day of week frequency is best used for organizational
       activities such as a PTA meeting on the second Tuesday of
       the month for only the months of September thru May.

       The Weeks of year frequency would be used for repetitive
       activities such as doing something every other week or
       every fourth week.

       There are other fields on the detail screen, however they are
       pretty much self-explanatory.


;/

       Inquiry Menu

       The 3 main key fields to Momsys are Activity, Assignment, and
       Location.  Individual entries can be found in the following
       fashion.

       1.  Select the Inquiry Menu on the Main Menu.

       2.  Select one of the key fields.
           For example the Location selection.

       3.  The various locations will pop up on another menu.

       4.  Make a selection in the menu.

       5.  A summary screen will then appear of which you will select
              an entry.

       5.  Then the specific record will be displayed.

       Note: This is much easier done than explained here.  An example
       file comes with Momsys, and just by using Momsys with these
       instructions you will see what I'm talking about.



       Options

       Momsys can be used with a variety of activity files.

       If you just type in MOMSYS at the prompt you will automatically
       be accessing the MOMSYS.DAT file.  If you want to create other
       files you would type in MOMSYS <other-name>.DAT.

       Remember, each data file can contain multiple people.

       If you plan to use multiple activity files it would be best
       if you set up batch files to execute rather than remembering
       each individual file name.

       Momsys does not require that you put the .DAT extension on
       the filename but it will not add it for you.

       Examples:

         MOMSYS WORK.DAT      -  for work

         MOMSYS HOME.DAT      -  for home

         MOMSYS BUSINESS.DAT  -  for business

         HOME.BAT AND TEST.BAT files are examples on the diskette.

       Reports Menu
       ------------

       You can print either a daily report or a calendar report
       with this menu.

       After selecting one of these entries you will be asked
       for the date.  If you just press the enter key you will
       always be right for the day or month.

       You can override the default date by merely entering the
       proper numbers.  This is often useful if you want to print
       out several days in advance.


       Daily Report
       ------------

       The daily report will print by person assigned, location,
       then activity.

       Appointments are printed first, then regular activities, then
       reminders.

       Reminders are base upon the reminder days in the detail screen.

       Time and money required are sub-totaled and totaled for each
       person assigned.


       Calendar Report
       ---------------

       The calendar print option has been added for planning purposes.

Momsys was written with Micrsoft's Cobol Version 3.  Which is compatible

with Micro Focus Cobol/2 as I understand it.

If you would like a more customized version of Momsys for your individual

situation I would be happy to consider any proposals.


Future versions of Momsys will contain a variety of frequency codes not

presently in this version,  a display screen of daily activities option

and a variety of other reports.  Also, a work schedule module will be

added to allow for activity scheduling based upon work days.  An example

of this would be activities based upon the first or second work day of

the month, or the last or second to last work day of the month.
