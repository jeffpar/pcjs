## Information about "IT'S ALL IN THE BABY'S NAME"

    Planning to have a baby? Then you will certainly want this program
    which helps you choose the right name to insure your offspring's future
    success! Great gift for your friends who are about to become parents!
    
    Tell the computer the baby's last name and it will provide you with an
    almost endless list of combinations of first and middle names that you
    can view or print. Names are drawn from a large variety of ethnic
    backgrounds and sources and provide a great starting point for naming
    the next generation. Some combinations can be quite startling, some
    quite plain, and some will be recognized as relatives.
    
    Another option allows Mom and Dad to scan prospective first names and
    choose likely candidates. Your trusty computer then mixes and matches
    them and lists them out with your last name for comparison shopping. The
    result allows the proud parents-to-be to mull over the combinations
    which look and sound best and try to pick something even the child will
    like.
    
    NUMBER MAGIC teaches preschool children number recognition and
    counting skills. Favorite childhood songs reward success and the game
    encourages older siblings to share in the learning. After a parent
    gets things started, counting, matching, and maze games help your
    children learn, while making the learning a more rewarding experience
    for all.
