## Information about "PC BINGO AND WORDS*WORDS"

    Throw your next Bingo party at your home, church or school with Michael
    Bielkiewicz's PC BINGO. Easy to use, it plays like the real thing -- no
    strings attached.  Print out up to 8 Bingo cards per 8 1/2 X 11 inch
    paper, distribute among your players and let the computer choose the
    Bingo numbers.
    
    A great party game, PC BINGO could actually be used to replace the old
    ping-pong ball method of the game -- though that day is somewhat in the
    future.  The ease of this package makes it accessible to all ages who
    share a love for the Bingo game.
    
    A sophisticated word game, WORDS*WORDS is a logical deduction puzzle in
    which puzzle words are linked to quotations and proverbs.  You have to
    deduce five-letter puzzle words by guessing no more than 18 words. For
    each guess WORDS*WORDS tells you how many letters are common to the
    puzzle word.  For example, if the puzzle word was "drums" and you
    guessed "stump" the program would tell you that "3" letters match.  The
    program uses a 6000 word dictionary to check your guess words.
    
    The instructions are simple to follow.  Function keys let you save
    letters that are part of the word or discard letters that are not part
    of the word, which helps you organize your thoughts.
    
    There are no flashy colors or graphics, but if you love intellectual
    exercise, the 50 carefully chosen puzzle words and quotations will
    amuse you and challenge you for many hours.
    
    This program could be used for helping children with spelling and word
    associations.  An amusing yet challenging game for ages 12 and up,
    WORD*WORD breaks through its simple format with its tough puzzle
    solving.
