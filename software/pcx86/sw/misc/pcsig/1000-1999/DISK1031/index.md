## Information about "ONE-TO-ONE"

    ONE-TO-ONE (121) is a unique, easy-to-use telecommunications program
    designed for interactive communications between two people (as opposed
    to calling a bulletin board service).  Type messages back and forth by
    modem (chat) during file transfers.  Separate windows of text are
    provided for both incoming and outgoing messages and each window can be
    scrolled by either user.
    
    Other features include pull-down menus and a thorough series of easily
    accessible help screens.
