## Information about "MICRO STATISTICS PACKAGE"

    Here is a powerful statistical package -- lots of muscle, but an
    unintimidating look and feel.  THE MICRO STATISTICAL PACKAGE (MSP) is an
    integrated system consisting of a command line interpreter and a set of
    statistical procedures with many utility routines.  Together they are
    used to perform analyses and mathematical operations on data stored in
    the program's worksheet.
    
    This package is intended to be used by students and researchers dealing
    with small or medium size data analysis problems.  It allows the user to
    perform a wide variety of statistical analyses on columns of data
    contained in a worksheet.  The user manipulates data in a typical
    statistical worksheet by typing in English commands indicating actions
    to be taken on the column or columns of data.  Commands are also
    provided to edit data contained in the worksheet.
    
    There are over 100 commands, including procedures for regression,
    analysis of variance, correlation, Chisquare analysis of count data,
    plotting, sorting, transforming data, stem and leaf displays, boxplots,
    nonparametric statistics, cross tabulation, save and retrieval of files,
    letter value displays, condensed plots, pop-up reverse Polish calculator
    with combinations and permutations and over 25 functions, pop-up
    distribution calculator to compute Normal, T, F and Chisquare
    distribution P values and help commands.
