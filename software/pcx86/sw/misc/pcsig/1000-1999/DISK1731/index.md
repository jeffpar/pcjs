## Information about "QUICK CHECK BOOK 2 OF 2 (1721 ALSO)"

    Balancing your checkbook and savings accounts can now be a breeze, with
    QUICK CHECK BOOK. QUICK CHECK BOOK is a menu driven program that
    smooths the effort of maintaining a checkbook, paying bills, sticking to
    a budget, and writing checks.
    
    The absence of accounting terminology, account numbers, and confusing
    methods make QUICK CHECK BOOK the perfect solution for those who like to
    keep things simple and smart. Each menu selection has a pop-up help
    window.
    
    QUICK CHECK BOOK has no limit to the number of checkbooks it can
    maintain, or the number of transactions in a checkbook. The amount of
    storage space available determines your limitations on the number of
    checkbooks and transactions.
    
    QUICK CHECK BOOK is usable in various ways. If you want to write
    checks, it does so on your checks and your printer. If you only want to
    maintain a check database or budget, QUICK CHECK BOOK does that too.
    Balancing with the bank will no longer be the source of anguish. To
    balance with the bank, you simply confirm a transaction amount against
    your bank statement by pressing the return/enter key. QUICK CHECK BOOK
    does the rest.
    
    A calculator, calendar, and other utilities are always a key stroke or
    two away. Mouse support is also available.

                                 Introduction

                                      to

                               QUICK CHECK BOOK



       QUICK CHECK BOOK'S purpose is to improve the speed and accuracy of
       maintaining  a  personal checkbook or savings account over manual
       methods.  It is a menu driven program that smooths the effort  of
       maintaining  a checkbook, paying bills, sticking to a budget, and
       writing checks.

       The  absence  of  accounting  terminology,  account  numbers, and
       confusing methods make QUICK CHECK BOOK the perfect solution  for
       those of us who would like to keep things simple and smart.  Each
       menu selection has a pop up help window.   The  F1  key  accesses
       them.

       QUICK CHECK BOOK is mousitised, colorised, and sanitized.

       It  has  no limit to the number of checkbooks it can maintain, or
       the number of transactions in a checkbook.  The amount of storage
       space  available  determines  your  limitations  on the number of
       checkbooks and transactions.

       QUICK CHECK BOOK is usable in various ways.  If you want to write
       checks with QUICK CHECK BOOK, it does it on YOUR checks and  YOUR
       printer,  not just on a printer and form that somebody else uses.
       If you only wish to maintain a check data base or  budget,  QUICK
       CHECK BOOK does that too.

       Balancing with the bank will no longer be the source of  anguish.
       To balance with the bank, you simply confirm a transaction amount
       against your bank statement by  pressing  the  return/enter  key.
       QUICK CHECK BOOK does the rest.

       A  calculator,  calendar,  and  other  utilities are always a key
       stroke or two away.

       QUICK CHECK BOOK has been written to allow redirection of data to
       different  devices  through  menu selections.  These menus appear
       just before data is sent out, such as check writing or reporting.
       The  output  can  be sent to a printer, the screen, or a file for
       future use.  Report file outputs  are  usable  by  your  favorite
       spreed sheet or data base.

       When  you  elect to send data to a file you must follow DOS rules
       in naming the file.  No more than 8 characters per  name  plus  3
       for the extension. Refer to your DOS manual under naming files.

       If, during install, you chose that a printer was not part of your
       system, or QUICK CHECK BOOK does not find your  printer  on  line
       when  its time to print.  Then the printer select option will not
       be present.

       You may change your setup data at any time.  If  you  change  the
       drive  or  directory  of your data, while in the program, it will
       close your current file and start a new checkbook at the new data
       location.


















       QUICK CHECK BOOK will operate with 184K bytes of  free  RAM,  but
       accessing   the  check  register  and  payment  file  maintenance
       routines from within the program will not be possible.  They will
       have to be run from the DOS command line.  In order to avoid this
       hassle, make sure there is a minimum of 384K RAM  before  loading
       QUICK  CHECK  BOOK.  QUICK CHECK BOOK, once loaded, will show the
       remaining memory.

                               GETTING STARTED


       This  manual makes the assumption that you have working knowledge
       of DOS. Otherwise you wouldn't have gotten this far.

       Back up the originals on working disks, or into  a  sub-directory
       on  your  hard disk.  Make some copies for your friends while you
       are at it.

       If you are using a hard drive, copy both disks to a subdirectory.
       The name is up to you, but here is  an  example  of  a  directory
       named  "QCB".  At the DOS prompt type in "MD \QCB<enter>".  Place
       disk #1 in drive A:.  Type in "COPY A:*.* \QCB<enter>" Place disk
       #2  in  drive A:.  Type in "COPY A:*.* \QCB<enter>", then type in
       "CD \QCB<enter>"

       If  you  are using a 5.25 inch, two floppy drive system, you need
       to set a search path to both drives.  You can do this  by  typing
       in  "SET  PATH=A:;B:<enter>",  or  include  this  command in your
       autoexec file that you start your machine with.  Place a copy  of
       your command.com on disk #1.  Place disk #1 in drive A:  and disk
       #2 in drive B:.  Log to drive B:  by typing "B:<enter>".

       If you are using a single 5.25 inch floppy drive  system  and  no
       hard  drive,  you  need  to  place  a copy of command.com on both
       disks.  The checking routines are on disk #1 and data base editor
       is  on  disk  #2.  They will have to be run separately.  Start by
       placing disk #1 in the drive.

       At the DOS prompt, type in "QCB<enter>".  When QCB starts it will
       recognize  the  absence  of  "SETUP.DAT",  and  run  the  install
       routine, which modifies and creates SETUP.DAT.  You will be given
       the opportunity to change  the  colors,  printer,  display  card,
       monitor,  data  drive  and  directory.  Use the up and down arrow
       keys to select the item you wish to change, then press  enter  to
       select from a list of possible alternatives.

       Once you have set up QUICK CHECK BOOK,  then  you  are  ready  to
       start by selecting "Accept these settings."

       QUICK CHECK BOOK will prompt you to choose a file name, or create
       one.   The  sample  files are for learning and example.  Use them
       for awhile to get a feel for how the program works.

       When  you  are ready to create your own check book file, Quit and
       choose create a new file.  First select a name for your  checking
       account. Any eight character name that describes a given checking
       or saving account.  Next, enter the name and address that applies
       to the check register.  The last two things, starting balance and
       check number, will inaugurate a new check register.

                           Starting your checkbook

       Pick  a spot in your existing manual checkbook where you and your
       bank last agreed on  a  balance  (you  reconciled  your  checking
       account  with the bank statement).  Use the bank statement figure
       for your starting balance.  Choose the first check  number  after
       your starting point as the starting check number.

       IMPORTANT:   YOU  CAN AUTOMATE YOUR DATA ENTRY, but the necessary
       information must be in the "Payments  File"  first.   We  suggest
       that  you  go  to  the  utility  menu and select the payment file
       maintenance routine.  It allows you to enter your  payments  data
       for automatic check writing.  If the amount you will be paying on
       a regular basis is variable (not a fixed amount) then  use  0  as
       the  amount.   The  automatic  check  writing  function will then
       prompt you for a check amount at check writing time.

       If you are unable to select the payments file maintenance routine
       from within QUICK CHECK BOOK,  then  refer  to  page  13  for  an
       explanation  on  how to edit the check register and payments file
       from outside QUICK CHECK BOOK.

       With your balance in place and next check number identified it is
       time to start entering checks and deposits  that  you  have  made
       since your last bank reconcile.

       Enter outstanding checks, cash withdrawals and deposits  in  your
       register.   Use  the automatic check writing function if you have
       already entered payments data.  When the output router asks where
       to  send  the  output,  select  the  screen  if you don't want to
       actually print the check.  Data is recorded, regardless of  where
       you route the output, unless you select exit.

       When finished entering outstanding transactions,  use  the  Check
       Register  Maintenance  function,  found  in  the Utility Menu, to
       correct any mistakes.  If your check numbering is out of sequence
       use  the  Adjust  Next Number function, also found in the Utility
       Menu, to reset automatic check numbering.

       ----Automatic Check Entry----

       This  selection  presents you with a list of commonly paid items;
       from it, you pick which one to pay.

       To  write  checks  automatically the data must be in the payments
       file.  There are two ways to create an entry.  First by using the
       Editor  maintenance  feature located in the utility menu.  Second
       by choosing Manual Check Entry.   When  finished  entering  basic
       information  the program will ask for data conformation.  At this
       point, you may elect to add this  information  to  your  payments
       file.

       If  the  list  gets  large and not all the entries are shown just
       press the first character of your selection and the program  will
       highlight the first match found;  press it again and the next one
       will highlight.  Or scroll through the list with the PgDn,  PgUp,
       up/down arrow keys or use a mouse on the scroll bar.

                                    Page 8





       ---- Balance with Bank Statement. ----

       First  enter  service  charges,  dividends, interest or any other
       transactions not recorded.  Then select balance with the bank.  A
       full screen of uncleared transactions will be shown.  Highlight a
       transaction and press enter to toggle its  cleared  or  uncleared
       state.   Press  PgDn  to see if more uncleard transactions exist.
       Continue until all statement items  marked.   Press  escape  when
       finished.

       Answering Yes at completion will compare the banks stated balance
       against  QUICK  CHECK BOOK's adjusted balance.  If the balance is
       correct, a bank balance record is added to the check register  on
       the current system date.

       If  QUICK  CHECK  BOOK  balances  with the bank you then have the
       opportunity to clear all last year's transactions and store  them
       in a separate file.

       ---- Enter A Deposit. ----

       Deposits are made with this selection.  There are various deposit
       types;  income, non-income, escrow and beginning.  When  entering
       a  deposit,  you  select  whether  it  is an income or non-income
       deposit.  QUICK CHECK BOOK codes  all  deposit  types  for  sort,
       budget, and tax purposes.

       ---- Manaul Check Entry ----

       This function allows the user to write a single check without the
       use of the payments file.  Answer questions as presented  on  the
       screen.   You  will  be able to do one of three things after data
       entry:  1- Cancel, 2- Write check into register and write it,  or
       3-  Add  the  current  entry to the payment file and then use the
       automatic check entry to write the check.

       ---- Non-Check Debit Entry ----

       Enter deductions that do not require a check with this selection.
       Examples  of  a  Non-check  debit  entries  are;    Bank   teller
       withdrawals,  Bank card deductions and Service charges.  If there
       is no regular payment entry to select from, then  select  "Add  a
       payable Record" at the end of the list of current payment items.

       ---- Quit And Return To DOS ----

       Allows you to exit the program or load another checkbook.

       ---- Utilities Menu ----

       You have a choice of functions that make using this program easy.


       ---- Budget Item Status Report ----

       Presents an accumulation of monies spent in budget categories

       ---- Adjust The Next Check Number ----

       This will adjust check numbers used by QUICK CHECK BOOK on future
       transactions.  When prompted for the next check number, enter it,
       then press the enter or return key.

       After changing the next check number to use, the  status  message
       will display a last check number of one fewer than the next check
       number.

       ---- Transaction Summary Report ----

       Allows you to report on or view the check register  transactions.
       You  may  choose  to  view  all  transactions or the last page of
       transactions.  If you choose an output  route  to  a  printer  or
       file,  the  last page is the last 55 transactions.  If you choose
       output to the screen, only a screen full of transactions will  be
       shown.

       If  you  did  not  previously  sort the transaction register, the
       report will be in the same sequence as the transaction entry.

       Sort  the  transaction  register  with the sort utility.  You can
       sort on any of the data fields.

       NOTE:   Sorting  does  not  change the transaction sequence.  The
       sort is lost when you change the data or end  the  program.   You
       can resort the transaction file at any time.

       ---- Envelope Printer ----

       This function allows you to print the envelope that you will mail
       your check in.  You can print a return address by itself.   Print
       your  return  address  and  choose an addressee from the payments
       file,  or manually enter the Name and Address of addressee.

       ---- Data Backup ----

       One never knows when something might happen to your  data  files.
       It's  a good idea to always keep at least one backup copy of your
       data.  Use this utility to backup your data every time you change
       it.  The routine will prompt you for a drive to backup on.  Press
       A or B.  Insert your backup disk in the appropriate  drive,  then
       press a key to start the action, or press Q to quit.

       Remember, if you have backups.
                               "Nothing can go wrong."
                               "Nothing can go wrong."
                               "Nothing can go wrong."

       ---- Change Setup ----

       This  function loads and runs the install program allowing you to
       change your configuration from within the program.

       ---- Escrow Account Maintenance ----

       A unique feature that operates as a slush fund.  Money is in  the
       account, but not shown in running balance.  Especially useful for
       putting  small  amounts  away  for  real  estate  taxes  or  auto
       insurance.

       ---- Check Register Maintenance ----

       This selection will shell to the check register data base manager
       routine, if you have enough memory and the data base  program  is
       in  the  current  directory.  When in the data base editor, press
       the F1 key for info on it's use.

       If you delete a transaction or change  the  last  balance,  QUICK
       CHECK BOOK will recalculate all transaction balances.

       ---- Payments file Maintenance ----

       This selection will shell  to  the  payments  data  base  manager
       routine,  if  you have enough memory and the data base program is
       in the current directory.  When in the data  base  editor,  press
       the F1 key for info on it's use.

       ---- Changing Check Number ----

                            Using QCB-DB from DOS

       If  you  don't have adequate RAM or storage space to run the data
       editor from within QCB.  You  can  edit  the  check  register  or
       payment files by following these instructions.

       QCB-DB.EXE  uses  data  files  named  QCB-LOG.DAT,  for the check
       register, and QCB-PAY.DAT, for the payments file.  The user  must
       supply  these  files  by  copying  your  current  check  register
       (YourFile.CHK)  or  current  payments  file   (YourFile.PAY)   to
       QCB-LOG.DAT or QCB-PAY.DAT respectively.

       This  can be done by creating batch files that will copy and name
       your files appropriately for use by QCB-DB.EXE.  We suggest names
       like  ED-CHECK.BAT  and ED-PAY.BAT.  Refer to your DOS manual for
       information on batch (.BAT) files.

       These examples assume a two disk drive system.  Your data is on a
       floppy disk in drive B:, and QCB-DB.EXE is in Drive A:.  You will
       have to substitute the appropriate drive, path, and file names in
       your files.

       To generate ED-CHECK.BAT type  in  the  following  from  the  DOS
       command line:                             ' comments, do not enter
        A: <enter>                               ' log to drive a:
        COPY CON ED-CHECK.BAT <enter>            ' name file and type in
        COPY B:YourFile.CHK QCB-LOG.DAT <enter>  ' copy your check file
        QCB-DB QCB-DB QCB-LOG <enter>            ' run the editor
        COPY QCB-LOG.DAT B:YourFile.CHK <enter>  ' copy revised file
        <F6> <enter>                             ' save the batch file

       To generate ED-PAY.BAT type  in  the  following  from  the  DOS
       command line:                             ' comments, do not enter
        A: <enter>                               ' log to drive a:
        COPY CON ED-PAY.BAT <enter>              ' name file and type in
        COPY B:YourFile.PAY QCB-PAY.DAT <enter>  ' copy your payment file
        QCB-DB QCB-DB QCB-PAY <enter>            ' run the editor
        COPY QCB-PAY.DAT B:YourFile.PAY <enter>  ' copy revised file
        <F6> <enter>                             ' save the batch file

       To run the batch files type in ED-CHECK  or  ED-PAY  followed  by
       enter.


       If  you  don't use the batch file approach.  Please be aware that
       you must  copy  your  ?.CHK  or  ?.PAY  file  to  QCB-LOG.DAT  or
       QCB-PAY.DAT  in  the  QCB-DB directory in order for the data base
       manager to load them.  Press the F1 key for instructions  on  how
       to use the editor.  When your finished editing your data you must
       remember to copy the revised QCB-LOG.DAT or QCB-PAY.DAT  back  to
       YourFile.CHK or YourFile.PAY.

                   CUSTOMIZING YOUR CHECK AND REPORT FORMAT

       Without   a   YourFile.CFD   (check   form  definition)  file  or
       YourFile.RFD (report form definition), Quick Check  Book  uses  a
       built in check and report format.  To create your own you must be
       able  to  create  an  American  System  Information  Code  second
       revision text file.  ( ASICII )

       One easy and fast way to indentify whether a word  processor  can
       produce  an  ASICII  text  file  is to view a file it has already
       created using the DOS TYPE command.  Refer  to  your  DOS  manual
       under the " TYPE " command for more information.

       Let us say you have a file named YourFile.PRN,  created  by  your
       word processor or editor, do the following:

                         A:> TYPE YourFile.PRN
                         A:> TYPE YourFile.PRN >PRN

       The first DOS TYPE command sends YourFile.PRN to the  screen  and
       secound  to the printer.  If there are no recognizable characters
       or other characters that you don't recognize  as  being  part  of
       YourFile.PRN,  then  the  file is not an ASICII text file.  Check
       your word processor manual for details on how to create an  ASCII
       file.   Most word processors either create, or can convert to and
       from ASICII text files.

       If your word processor will not  generate  ASCII  text,  you  can
       still  generate  a  check or report form definition file by using
       the DOS "COPY CON" approach. Refer to your DOS manual.

                            CHECK FORM DEFINITION

       You can override the default check printing  format  by  creating
       your  own.   Your  check  form definition file must have the same
       name as your check registers and have an extension of ".CFD".  It
       must  also  be  in the same directory as your check register data
       files.

       Your bank offers tractor feed check forms that are easily handled
       by most printers.

       The  number  of lines in your check form definition combined with
       the printers vertical line feed spacing determines  the  vertical
       height of check form definition.

       In this example we assume that your printer is set at 6 lines per
       inch.  So if your check form is 2 1/2 inches from top  to  bottom
       your form should contain 15 lines (6+6+3).

       If  you understand your printer control codes, you may embed them
       in quoted strings.  This allows you to change the number of lines
       per inch, print style, etc.

       Each  line  counts whether it has data or not.  Data for printing
       must be in quotes ("").  The number of  spaces  in  front  of  an
       identifier  determines  the horizontal position of a variable.  A
       line with two identifiers in it will have to consider the  length
       of it's preciding variables.

       Identifier  What it will print              length of data

                            REPORT FORM DEFINITION

       Report form definitions are similar to the check form definitions
       because they use the same variable identifiers and use  the  same
       naming convention.  But that is all that is similar.  Report form
       definitions must contain seven lines of  information.   The  file
       name extension must be ".RFD" instead of ".CFD".

       The first line contains the printer set up.  The  second  through
       the  fifth  lines  contain  the reports heading information.  The
       sixth line contains the end of page action to  be  taken  by  the
       printer.   The  seventh  and  last  line  contains  a list of the
       variables you want in the report.  Here's an example report  form
       definition:

"printer setup control coding, in quotes"
"                  Sheet [PG of Checkbook transactions on [CD"
"Check  Date of                                                          tran"
" no. transaction Paid to or By description        Amomnt     Balance     no "
