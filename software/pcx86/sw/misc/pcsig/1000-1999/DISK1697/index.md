## Information about "DML & XREF"

    Turbo Pascal programmers, take note!  Here are 87 Turbo Pascal
    routines not found in the standard version 4.0 or 5.0 library.  Full
    source code and documentation is included for each routine.
    
    The library is divided into four functional modules containing:
    
    ~ 42 general purpose procedures for such things as system programming
    extensions, file I/O and protection, text encryption, general purpose
    video and video messages, disk and memory sizes, instruction timing,
    general purpose file, math, DOS and version control
    
    ~ 18 numeric procedures for handling general numeric formatting and
    conversion, and date and time formatting and conversion
    
    ~ 14 string procedures to handle general purpose string functions and
    conversion
    
    ~ 13 keyboard procedures for controlling and accessing the keyboard and
    keyboard buffer.
    
    The entire library can be accessed by a single statement or the four
    unit modules can be accessed individually.  A demonstration is
    included that shows the action of each routine.
    
    An additional utility included is XREF, a Pascal source code
    cross-reference and formatting program.
