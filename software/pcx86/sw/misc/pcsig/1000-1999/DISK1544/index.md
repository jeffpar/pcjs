## Information about "KLONDIKE AND SLOT"

    KLONDIKE is a traditional gambling game similar to a card game most of
    us know as "Solitaire."  KLONDIKE differs from Solitaire in that you can
    only go through the deck one time, cards are dealt from the deck one at
    a time instead of three at a time, and betting is an important part of
    the game.
    
    The object of KLONDIKE is to put as many cards as possible on the
    "piles."  This is accomplished by moving the cards around on the screen
    by using either the mouse or the keyboard.  This game requires an EGA
    graphics adapter, which makes the graphics look so good it looks like
    you're playing with a real deck of cards.
    
    SLOT, by Ted Gruber Software, is a terrific slot machine simulation for
    your EGA systems.  You bet from 1 to 5 coins and then give the one armed
    bandit a pull.  If you're lucky enough you can make enough lucky bucks
    to pay for that new car you wanted.  It's so much like the casino slot
    machines you'll forget you're playing at home.  There are five ways to
    win, if you've got the guts to play 5 coins at a time that is, and the
    graphics alone make this program worth every quarter you put into it.
