## Information about "FLEXICAL"

    FLEXICAL tracks your business or social engagements and events, with
    up-to-date efficient and flexible calendars -- complete with
    explanations of where to go, what to do, and when to do it.  You will
    always have a calendar on your desk or wall, available to go with you
    when you travel.  The calendars expand to hold as many events as you
    choose, for any time period, with as many details as you want.  Print
    on standard 8-1/2" x 11" paper.
    
    The FLEXICAL system has two different types of calendars, the engagement
    calendar and the annual calendar.  Both are used to plan a new
    engagement.  The annual calendar gives you an overall view of the year,
    the engagement calendar shows you which time is free.  When making
    engagements while away from your computer, make notes on your paper copy
    for later data entry.  You can mark the annual calendar as you please,
    knowing that you can always print a new one whenever you like.
    
    Calendars can be kept for as many people or purposes as necessary.
    Events are presented on-screen and printed in date order, with up to 20
    lines of description per event.  Reschedule any event, change its
    description, or delete it.  Repetitive events can be entered once and
    are repeated each time period.
    
    FLEXICAL also keeps track of your runs or hikes and gives both summaries
    and detailed reports for up to 20 runners for any time period.
    Details include route descriptions, elevations and average speeds.
    
    The calendars and the runner's diary are independent of each other and
    can be used individually or together.
