## Information about "FLEXICAL"

    FLEXICAL tracks your business or social engagements and events, with
    up-to-date efficient and flexible calendars -- complete with
    explanations of where to go, what to do, and when to do it.  You will
    always have a calendar on your desk or wall, available to go with you
    when you travel.  The calendars expand to hold as many events as you
    choose, for any time period, with as many details as you want.  Print
    on standard 8-1/2" x 11" paper.
    
    The FLEXICAL system has two different types of calendars, the engagement
    calendar and the annual calendar.  Both are used to plan a new
    engagement.  The annual calendar gives you an overall view of the year,
    the engagement calendar shows you which time is free.  When making
    engagements while away from your computer, make notes on your paper copy
    for later data entry.  You can mark the annual calendar as you please,
    knowing that you can always print a new one whenever you like.
    
    Calendars can be kept for as many people or purposes as necessary.
    Events are presented on-screen and printed in date order, with up to 20
    lines of description per event.  Reschedule any event, change its
    description, or delete it.  Repetitive events can be entered once and
    are repeated each time period.
    
    FLEXICAL also keeps track of your runs or hikes and gives both summaries
    and detailed reports for up to 20 runners for any time period.
    Details include route descriptions, elevations and average speeds.
    
    The calendars and the runner's diary are independent of each other and
    can be used individually or together.

THE FLEXIBLE ENGAGEMENT CALENDAR, 
ALL-PURPOSE ADDRESS BOOK,
RUNNERS' DIARY & SUNSET CALCULATOR
By John Forester, Custom Cycle Fitments
726 Madrone Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94086. 408-734-9426

FLEXICAL CALENDAR
    It tells  you your  engagements [business,  social or  otherwise] with an
always up-to-date calendar that doesn't  waste  space  but  contains complete
descriptions of where to go and what to do. No more cramming small notes into
restricted space for any one time while carrying  blank spaces  for time that
has no  engagements. Each  day, hour or minute expands to fit your needs with
up to 20 lines  of description  per event.  You can  add, delete, reschedule,
change descriptions  at will.  Weekly, monthly, end of month, etc. events are
automatically  scheduled  for  as   long   as   you   specify.  Anniversaries
automatically appear  one year  in advance. Handles both American and British
date formats. Prints blank datebooks and blank calendars  for any  year. Past
events are converted to a Journal for your records.

FLEXINAMES ADDRESS-BOOK
    It keeps  your names  and addresses  in order  by both  personal name and
organization name. Changes  are  easy.  It  uses  a  powerful  logical search
function to  make lists  of names by descriptions you enter, or the names you
designate. It displays them,  and  prints  them  in  full-size,  pocket size,
mailing label and form letter formats, with or without letterheads. It checks
for presumed duplicates. It handles American, British, European  and Japanese
formats for addresses.

RUNNERS' DIARY
    This is  more than  a diary. It averages your speed. When you climb hills
it also calculates your equivalent level-ground  speed. It  counts your runs,
totals your  distances, calculates  average distance and speed for any period
of time. It shows you your current totals on the screen. It has space for any
remarks that you want to enter. And it does this for up to 20 runners.

SUNSET CALCULATOR
    This gives you the times of sunrise and sunset for any place on earth for
any date.

INTRODUCTION
      The FlexiCal  disk combines  two useful  desk accessories, a
flexible calendar and a complete address-book  and mailing system,
with a runner's and hiker's diary.

      FlexiCal  tells  you  your  engagements, business or social,
with an always up-to-date  calendar that  doesn't waste  space but
contains complete  descriptions of  where to go and what to do. No
more cramming small notes  into restricted  space for  any one day
while  carrying  blank  spaces  for  time that has no engagements.
FlexiCal lists only your engagements with no waste space, yet each
day,  hour  or  minute  expands  to  fit your needs. FlexiCal also
automatically creates a Journal of events that have  occurred, for
your future reference. 

      FlexiNames  lists  all  your  contacts.  It presents them by
personal  name,  by  firm  name,  by   any  combination   of  nine
characteristics   that   you   choose,   by   any  combination  of
descriptions that you have entered (for  which it  uses a powerful
logical  search  procedure),  or  as  a  listing of those that you
designate. FlexiNames presents these as  a  screen  listing  or in
printed form. The printed forms are a full-sized, 2-column address
book; a full-sized, 3-column, small-print address-book;  a pocket-
sized  small-print,  single-column  list  (if  your  printer  will
produce  small  print);  Rolodex  cards;  as   mailing  labels  in
American,  British  or  European  formats  as appropriate for each
address; and as individually addressed letters.

      Runner's Diary keeps track of your  rides and  provides both
summaries and detailed reports for up to 20 runners for any period
of time. Detailed run  reports include  route description, average
time  per  mile  (or  kilometer)  and  an  equivalent average time
corrected for elevation gain. For example, you can immediately see
your runs, their average times and your total miles for any month,
or week,  or any  period that  you choose.  The same  goes for any
other runner whose rides you input.

      The  Daylight  Program  tells  you  the  time of sunrise and
sunset for any point that you designate by  latitude and longitude
(except in the far north above latitude 60), for any date, so that
you can plan your rides and whether you need to  take a  lamp. You
give it  the date and it returns the daylight times. You may store
your own latitude and longitude for ready recall,  or you  may key
in new coordinates at any time without removing the stored ones. 







                                                                  2
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

      The  FlexiCal  Calendars  are remarkably flexible Engagement
and Event Calendars for personal and business use. You always have
a clean, up-to-date calendar on your desk or wall or with you when
you are away. The calendars don't  waste space  on empty  days and
hours but  they expand to hold as many events as you choose in any
timespan with all the details that you want to enter.  Because the
calendars are  printed on  8-1/2 x 11 paper, the same as the other
papers that you carry with you, they don't get lost  in the bottom
of your file folders or briefcase. 

      The   FlexiCal   system   employs  two  different  types  of
calendars, the  engagement calendar  and the  annual calendar. The
engagement  calendar  lists  only  your  engagements and important
dates in date order, giving the date, time of day  and day  of the
week for  each. This  tells you when you are engaged or need to do
particular things. The annual calendar shows  on one  page the day
of the  week for each date in the year, just what you are used to.
You use the engagement calendar to tell you what you should do and
when to do it. You use both the engagement calendar and the annual
calendar when deciding on  a new  engagement. The  annual calendar
tells you  which days  are suitable, the engagement calendar tells
you which time is free. 

      When making engagements while away from your office or while
your computer  is not  available, you  write a  note between other
events (FlexiCal leaves  a  blank  line  between  events  for this
purpose). Later,  you enter  the new  engagements on the computer,
delete those  whose time  has passed,  and print  a new engagement
calendar.  FlexiCal  also  maintains  a list of anniversaries that
appear on  your  schedule  one  year  in  advance,  each  with the
appropriate age given. 

      You can  mark up  the annual calendar as you please, knowing
that you can always  print a  new one  whenever you  like, for any
year.  For  those  who  like  to  use  small  datebooks  to record
summaries of their engagements, FlexiCal will  print datebooks for
any year  in two  formats, either with 2 months on each 8-1/2 x 11
page or in a  booklet that  folds to  4-1/4 x  5-1/2 inches. These
provide 1-inch  squares, marked with date and day of the week, for
you to record a summary of each day's engagements. 

      Whenever you delete events  whose time  has passed, FlexiCal
automatically transfers these events to its Journal, which forms a
record of what you  have done.  This Journal  may be  displayed or
printed, and once printed for a permanent record it may be erased.






                                                                  3
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

      Calendars may  be kept for as many people or purposes as you
like. Events are presented  on  screen  and  by  printout  in date
order, with  the date,  day of  the week and time of day for each.
Each event may  have  up  to  20  lines  of  description.  You may
reschedule any  event, change  its description,  or delete it. You
can delete all events prior  to  a  particular  time,  for example
yesterday, with  one keystroke.  That is,  all except those events
that you have classified as "tasks". These won't  be deleted until
you delete them as complete. Repetitive events may be entered once
and will be repeated for each week, each  month, same  day of same
week  of  each  month,  or  end  of each month, for as long as you
designate. Each calendar may use dates in either  American (month-
day-year) or  British (day-month-year)  format as you specify, and
that can be changed at any time.

      FlexiNames  accepts  the  following  information  about each
person:  courtesy  title  (Mr.,  The Hon., etc), first names, last
name, position, company  name,  street  address,  P.O.box, suburb,
city,  state,  nation,  postal  code,  home  phone, work phone and
extension, 78 characters of notes, whether  the address  is a home
or business  address, the  code letter for the address format that
is used in the person's home nation, and  the categories  to which
you assign  this person.  These categories  are nine that you have
named yourself (for example,  Business Associate,  Friend, Sailing
Associate, Relative,  etc). FlexiNames  presents the  names in two
orders: first in  order  of  firm  name  and  second  in  order of
personal name.  You may have two entries for those people for whom
you sometimes use the firm's address and at  other times  the home
address. If the name is merely of a firm with whom you do business
without a personal contact,  then  you  leave  the  personal names
blank and FlexiNames presents that name only on the business list,
not on the personal list. FlexiNames presents any selection of the
names that  you desire. You can select only personal names or only
company names.  You  can  select  those  with  any  combination of
categories  or  you  can  go  through  the  list  and individually
designate those to appear on  the  next  printout.  The full-sized
address book  is 8-1/2 x 11 and is printed in two columns. If your
printer will print in condensed type and with narrow line spacing,
the pocket-sized address book can be as small as a dollar bill and
can be printed on  both sides  of the  paper. You  can set  up for
either of  the two  common sizes  of Rolodex card. FlexiNames uses
the common size of mailing label, 3-1/2 x 15/16 (5 lines), and can
use it  in 1,  2 or 3- wide formats with 10 characters per inch or
1-wide with 12  characters  per  inch.  The  form  letters  may be
printed on  letterheaded paper  or FlexiNames  will print your own
letterhead in any type font that your printer can produce.

      Both  the  FlexiCal  calendar  and  FlexiNames  address-book
programs  will  service  many  different  individual calendars and
address books, so  you  can  have  different  lists  for different
purposes or  for different  people. All  you have to do is to give
them different  names when  setting up  a new  calendar or address
book. The Calendars  and the Address-Books are independent of each
other and may be used either individually or in combination. 

      Both the Calendars and the  Address-Books  are  easy  to use
because everything you need to do is listed on menus. There is one
menu for the Calendar but there is one  top menu  for the Address-
Book with  two subsidiary  menus for preparing the printing lists.
You just enter the task letter indicated and FlexiCal Program does
the rest.  Practically no  errors that you might commit will upset
the system.

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED
      FlexiCal Program runs on any IBM-PC-compatible computer with
at least  384K of  memory and  either dual-floppy drives or a hard
disk. All  calendars and  reports can  be printed  on an 80-column
printer.  The  pocket-sized  address  book requires a printer that
will print at about 15 characters per inch  and, preferably,  at a
reduced  line   spacing.  The   font  capability  of  the  printer
determines the  fanciness  of  the  letterheads  of  form letters.
Printing more than a few mailing labels requires a tractor feed.


INSTALLATION

Number of Files Allowed
      FlexiCal Program  requires that you tell DOS to increase the
number of files that  are allowed.  In your  CONFIG.SYS file enter
the  line  FILES=15.  If  your CONFIG.SYS already allows more than
that, don't reduce the  number. Then  reboot the  computer so that
DOS knows  the new  amount. Consult the DOS manual under Files and
Configuration headings if you need more information.


Bugs in DOS 4.0
      There is a bug in the DOS 4.0  FastOpen command  that allows
DOS to  wipe out all file entries when you have deleted one entry.
Don't put that  command  in  your  CONFIG.SYS  file  when  you use
FlexiCal.

Distributed Files
FLEXICAL is distributed in four files:

FXC.ZIP         Contains  the  program,  the  data  files, and the
                manual.
READ-FXC.ME     Contains   the    preliminary   instructions   for
                preparing new  disks and extracting the individual
                files from the .ARC file.
UZIP-FXC.BAT    Is the batch file that controls  the extraction of
                the individual files and prompts you to insert the
                correct disks at the proper times.
PKUNZIP.EXE     Is the program that extracts the individual files.

Extracting the Files
      Prepare three blank, formatted  disks.  Label  them FlexiCal
Program, FlexiCal Data, and FlexiCal Manual.

      Copy the  original distribution  disk to  a working disk and
place the original disk in a safe place.

      In the  following  instructions,  {ABC}  means  to  type the
command ABC and then press the Enter key.

      Dual-floppy users then insert the working disk into Drive B:
and make  that  the  current  drive.  Hard  disk  users  prepare a
directory for  FlexiCal and  copy the working disk {COPY *.*} into
that directory.  Make that  directory the  current directory. Then
{UZIP-FXC}. Then  follow the  instructions on the screen to insert
the correct disks at the proper time.

      After extracting the files onto  the  new  disks,  print out
this    manual     by    inserting    the    manual    disk    and
{TYPE FLEXICAL.DOC > PRN}. Naturally, the  above  instructions are
in the READ-FXC.ME file that you can read before printing out this
manual.

ENTERING APPLICATION INFORMATION
      The main menu  contains  the  choice  to  enter  and display
application  information  or  notes.  This provides one screen for
your own notes about how you use this  program. You  will probably
find it useful to record the particular printer settings, fonts to
be loaded, and such  information  on  this  screen.  You  may also
record   the   full   names   and  abbreviations  of  the  various
organizations whose files are managed by the program. Each line of
the screen is independent of the others.

STARTING THE ADDRESS-BOOK SYSTEM
      Is  is  easier  to  start  the  Address-Book  system  before
starting the Calendar system  because the  setting-up the Address-
Book also sets some of the Calendar functions.


UPDATING ADDRESS BOOKS CREATED PRIOR TO VERSION 2.7 (SEPT '89)
      Address-Book  programs  prior  to  Version 2.7 (shown on the
Address-Book Main Menu) had  less space  for notes  (because notes
could not  be used  as the basis for searches) and did not include
the Review Date. If you use Version 2.7  to try  to enter, display
or print  names and addresses from files made with prior versions,
it will terminate. No harm will be done, but you  must perform the
update procedure  to make  the files  useful with the new program.
Naturally, when you update an old file, the Review Date field will
contain  a  blank  date  because  the program cannot know when you
originated each name. If you inadvertently update a  file that has
Review Dates in it, you will blank those dates.

      First, copy  the new version of the file BKSTRUC.DBF that is
on your  data  disk  into  each  directory  and  each  floppy that
contains address  books. {COPY  A:BKSTRUC.DBF B:}  copies the file
from the new data disk in Drive A to an old data disk in  Drive B.
{COPY A:BKSTRUC.DBF C:\FXC} copies the file from the new data disk
in Drive A to the FXC directory of the hard  disk (naturally, give
the proper path and name for your own directory). 

      For  hard  disk  systems,  copy  the  new  program  into the
directory that contains your address-books and calendars. Remember
that  you  have  to  have  copied  the  new  version  of  the file
BKSTRUC.DBF into  that  directory.  Then  type  FCN  to  start the
program. Select  the Address Book, then select any address book if
you have more than one. Then  select 'K  Set  Up Address  Book and
Calendar Systems'.  Run through the screens without making changes
until you reach the update screen, the one  that asks  whether you
need to  update. Answer  Y, then Y again when it asks whether this
is a hard disk  system. Then  the program  will list  all the file
names that  need to  be updated.  Enter each file name in turn and
the program will update it.

      For dual-floppy systems, start with the  new program  on one
disk,  all  the  disks  that  have  address-books on them, and one
empty, formatted disk. Remember that you  have to  have copied the
new version  of the  file BKSTRUC.DBF  onto each data disk. Insert
the program disk into Drive A and a data disk  into Drive  B. Type
FCN to  start the  program, select  the Address Book, and from the





                                                                  7
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

Main Menu select 'K  Set  Up Address  Book and  Calendar Systems'.
Run  throught  the  screens  without  making any changes until you
reach the update screen,  the one  that asks  whether you  need to
update. Answer  Y, then N when it asks whether this is a hard disk
system. Then the program will pause  while you  remove the program
disk from  Drive A and insert the empty disk. Inserting this empty
disk gives the system  room for  temporary files,  so that  it can
update an  address book even thought the data disk is nearly full.
The files will increase  50 bytes  per name  because more  data is
stored; that  you will  have to  accept. After inserting the empty
disk, answer Y when asked if you are ready to proceed. The program
will then  list all  the file names that need to be updated. Enter
each file name in turn and the program will update it. Repeat this
sequence for each floppy that contains an address book.


SETTING UP YOUR ADDRESS BOOKS
      The distribution disk contains one address-book, the MTBOOK,
"empty book". The system always has to have at least  one address-
book in it, but you can delete the MTBOOK once you have added your
own. When there is only one address-book, Address-Book always goes
directly  to  it.  When  there are several, Address-Book starts by
showing you the list so you can select the one you want.  To start
your first address book, select the Address-Book from the FlexiCal
Program Main Menu. Then  select  "I  Change  The  List  Of Address
Books."  Then  follow  the  instructions  below  for  adding a new
address book.

ADDING A NEW ADDRESS BOOK
      From FlexiNames Main  Menu  select  "I  Change  The  List Of
Address Books."  Then select  A for  Adding. For Short Name select
some easy-to-remember and easy-to-type  set  of  letters,  such as
your initials or the initials of the organization, because this is
how you will open this address-book. For Name  enter the  name you
want.  This  name  will  appear  at  the  top  of  all screens and
printouts. You next have six characters for a  file name.  Enter a
File Name  that will remind you of what that file is when you next
look at  the directory.  Naturally, use  a name  that is different
from that of any other calendar or address book. Don't worry about
remembering it; the only  one that  you ought  to remember  is the
initial short-name and even then FlexiNames will show it to you if
you forget. Now that you have created a new address  book, you may
select it from the main menu by selecting "H  Select Address Book"
and then keying in its short name.







                                                                  8
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

DELETING AN ADDRESS BOOK
      You may delete any  address book  that is  not the currently
open address  book. From  the main  menu select "I  Change List of
Address Books" and then select Delete.  Key in  the short  name of
the address-book  that you  wish to delete. Since one address book
must always be open and you  cannot delete  the open  address book
you always  have one address book on the list. If you use only one
address book but want to delete it, create  an empty  address book
(call it  MTBOOK if  you like) select it, and then delete your own
address book.

RENAMING AN ADDRESS BOOK
      You may  rename any  address-book by  selecting Rename. This
allows you  to rename its Short Name, the Name, and the File Name.
Just like the deletion function,  you  cannot  rename  the current
address-book.

SETTING UP THE ADDRESS-BOOK SYSTEM
      In  setting   up  the  address-book  system  you  enter  the
information that controls the printer when  printing the different
kinds  of  address  books  and  mailing  labels. Select "J  Set Up
Address-Book System" from the main menu. The first screen asks you
whether your  printer is  hand fed with individual sheets, whether
you want to print the pocket-sized address book  on both  sides of
the paper,  the number of text lines per page for the pocket-sized
book, the characters per  inch  for  printing  mailing  labels and
Rolodex  cards  (10  or  12  only),  and  whether you will use the
printer to print the letterheads  for  form  letters.  Don't worry
about being  specific at the start; these can all be changed later
as you try the operations. 

      The next screen asks you to enter the  printer control codes
for printing  each kind  of document.  If you enter nothing on all
lines, your printer will continue to  print in  its normal manner.
This is  what you do if your printer prints in only one manner. If
your printer can print with several  fonts and  several characters
per inch,  you can  enter control  codes to  make it  print as you
want. If you enter something on any line, your printer  will print
that document  as you  specify and  will continue printing in that
manner until you reset  it. If  you enter  the proper  codes under
Regular Printing,  FlexiNames will  reset your  printer after each
different kind of printing is complete.  Each make  of printer has
its  own  instruction  codes,  but  generally  each instruction is
preceded by the ASCII  code 27,  the escape  code. Therefore these
are called  escape-code sequences.  Consult you  printer manual to
find the code sequences that  you  need.  Convert  these  codes to





                                                                  9
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

their ASCII  code numbers (like 27 for Escape, 67 for C). For each
type of document you probably need to specify the font to be used,
the characters  per inch, the line spacing and the form length, at
least where these differ  from your  normal. For  Regular Printing
you need to specify either the reset code that resets your printer
to normal, or the full  sequence  of  codes  that  will  return to
normal all the characteristics that you might have changed for any
document. You  enter  these  into  the  illuminated  box  for each
document as  numbers (not  individual digits)  separated by single
spaces. Like so: 27 63 97 27 70 54 54. Then <enter>.  

SETTING UP AN INDIVIDUAL ADDRESS BOOK
      Each individual address book has its  own set  of categories
and its  own letterhead  for form letters. Once you have set up an
address  book,  select  from  the  FlexiNames  menu  "I     Change
Categories and  Letterhead". The first screen will ask you to name
as many as you wish of the nine categories A through I.  These are
search categories:  they enable  you to  find quickly  and to list
those people or firms with any combination of  characteristics. So
think  how  you  will  use  this  address  book  and decide on the
appropriate names for the characteristics for which you might want
to search  or to  list. Be careful; while you can change the names
of the characteristics at any time, you must  then go  through all
the names  with the  former characteristics and reclassify them to
the newer characteristics.

      The second screen asks for the printer control codes and the
text for  each of six lines of letterhead for form letters. If you
don't want your printer  to  produce  fancy  letterheads  for form
letters, you  may leave  this screen  blank. Otherwise, enter into
the upper of each  pair of  lines the  appropriate printer control
codes,  determined  in  the  same  way  as you used when initially
setting up the address-book  system. Into  the lower  of each pair
enter the text, spaced appropriately to get it centered if that is
what you want. It may take several tries to get  the letterhead as
you desire  it, so  make trial  runs with just one at a time until
you get it correct. 

SELECTING THE MAILING LABEL FORMAT
      You have four choices of label format. FlexiCal Program uses
the common  5-line label that is 3-1/2 x 15/16 inches in size. You
can print with 12 characters per inch, 40 characters per  line, on
label  stock  that  is  one  label  wide.  You  can  print with 10
characters per inch, 35 characters per  line, on  label stock that
is 1-wide,  2-wide, or 3-wide. The label format files are the .LBL
files on the FlexiCal Program data disk. LAB112.LBL is for 1-wide,





                                                                 10
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

12 chars/inch,  LAB110.LBL is for 1-wide, 10 char/inch, LAB210.LBL
is for  2-wide, 10  chars/inch, and  LAB310.LBL is  for 3-wide, 10
chars/inch.  Copy  the  format  that  you  wish to use to the file
ADDLAB.LBL.



OPERATING THE ADDRESS-BOOK
      Operating FlexiNames is straightforward. If you  have set up
only one address book, commanding FlexiNames moves you directly to
that one. If you have set up several,  commanding FlexiNames moves
you to  a screen  from which  you select  the one that you desire.
From the main menu you can select:

                    Jim Smith's ADDRESS BOOK
                            MAIN MENU

      A         Enter New Names and Addresses
      B         Revise A Name or Address
      C         Delete A Name
      D         Display the Name and Address List
      E         Display the Category List
      F         Do Any Printing Operation
      G         Select the Address Book
      H         Change the List of Address Books
      I         Change Categories and Letterhead for Address Book
      J         Set Up Address Book System
      K         Back-Up This Address-Book Data
      X         Exit Address Book System



ENTERING AND REVISING NAMES
      The operations from the main menu  are straightforward. When
entering a  new name  or revising an old one, any entry except the
format for the address may  be  left  blank.  The  format  for the
address  must  be  entered  as  either  A (American), B (British),
E (European) or J (Japanese). You will probably find it easiest if
you leave  blank the  entry for  your own  nation, because in most
nations you use a national name only for  foreign letters.  If you
sometimes  use  your  national  name and sometimes don't, when you
print mailing labels in postal code order you will have two groups
of mailing  labels for  your own  nation: one for the blank entry,
one for the named entry.

Personal Miles Instruction Manual

ENTERING NOTES FOR SPECIAL SEARCHES
      FlexiNames  has  a  very  powerful  searching  function that
enables  you  to  compile  special  lists  of people or firms with
particular combinations of characteristics.  You need  to describe
each  characteristic  which  you  think  is  significant about the
person  or  firm  with  an  abbreviation.  If  your  interests are
transportation you might use 'rr' for railroad personnel or firms,
'at' for air transport,  'mt'  for  motor  truck,  'ss'  for ocean
steamships. If your interests are artistic, you might use 'paint',
'sculpt',  'phot',  'dance'  as  descriptors.  If  you  have  both
interests,  you  can  use  all  of  these  and  more  as well. Use
abbreviations because  you have  only 78  characters available per
name, but  you can  create a  new abbreviation at any time because
there  is  no  fixed  list  of  them.  Each  abbreviation  must be
separated  from   other  text   and  other  abbreviations  by  the
separating symbol. This is  a symbol  that you  will use  only for
this purpose.  You want any typed character that does not apply to
your interests and is easy to type. Many people use the semicolon,
but you  can use any other except the logical symbols that follow:
( ) ^ + !. These  are used  to describe  the logic  of the search.
When you enter the abbreviations that apply to one person or firm,
be sure to start with the separating symbol, insert the separating
symbol  between  each  abbreviation,  and  end with the separating
symbol. Thus, if you want to  describe  a  person  as  employed in
railroading  and  with  photography  as  a  hobby, you would enter
;rr;phot;.  You use  the separating  symbol because  if you didn't
you would have rrphot. Then, if you had used 'rp' for reporter and
then searched for all  'rp', rrphot  would be  caught because 'rp'
appears in  it, even  though you  hadn't intended to describe this
person as a reporter.

      You may also use the Notes field to enter any notes that you
think useful,  even though  you may  never plan to use those notes
for searching. For example, you may enter the  spouse's name, just
so that  you can  refer to it, even though it is unlikely that you
would ever want to search your list for all persons  with a spouse
named Jerry.

PRINTING THE LOGICAL-SEARCH ABBREVIATIONS
      The logical  search procedure requires that you always enter
a characteristic with the same abbreviation. To help  you do this,
Address-Book sorts  into alphabetical  order all the abbreviations
that appear in each  address book  and prints  them out.  From the
Print  Preparation  Menu  select 'G   Print List of Logical-Search
Phrases'. You should keep  a copy  of this  printout for reference
when entering  new names and for reference when desiring to make a





                                                                 12
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

search. You can also use this list to  correct misspelled  or non-
standard abbreviations. 

REVIEW DATE
      Whenever you  enter a  new name  or revise  data for a name,
FlexiNames enters today's date  into that  record. This  tells you
how old  the information  is. Of course, your computer has to have
the correct date in its operating data. 

REVISING A PERSONAL OR COMPANY NAME
      When you are intending to revise or delete  a name, Address-
Book asks you whether you want to search for the name by person or
by company. You then enter the name (or just the  first letters of
it, or  just the letter A to reach the start of the list), and the
first entry that matches your  input  appears  on  the  screen. If
there is  no matching  entry, the  first entry after the name that
you entered appears. You may then scroll through the list with the
UP and  DOWN Arrows until you find the proper entry. Then pressing
HOME will start the  operation on  the entry  that's shown  on the
screen. Pressing END will terminate the scrolling without starting
to revise or delete.

REMOVING DUPLICATE ENTRIES FROM THE LIST
      You  may  have  both  deliberate  and  inadvertent duplicate
entries in  the list.  A deliberate personal duplicate is when you
want to send one person more than one copy of  your newsletter, or
when  one  person  has  both  a  normal  and  a  summer address. A
deliberate company duplicate is when you have separate entries for
each  person  whom  you  contact,  or  when one company has branch
offices. An inadvertent duplicate  is  one  that  you  don't want.
Since  Address-Book   can't  know   your  intention,  Address-Book
presents each series of  duplicate  personal  names  and duplicate
company names  to you  so that  you may decide whether to keep all
entries of a series or delete one (or more) of them. To  check all
duplicate entries, select 'E   Check List For Duplicates' from the
Main Menu. Address-Book  will  first  check  the  entire  list for
duplicate  personal  names,  then  for  duplicate  company  names.
Whenever duplicate names are  detected, Address  Book will present
the first  of the  series on the lower half of the screen. You may
scroll through the list one entry at a time with  the Up  and Down
arrows. Examine  the series  of duplicate names to see whether you
want to delete any one. If you want to compare two entries  to see
whether they are exact duplicates, pressing the Page Up key copies
the current entry to the upper  half of  the screen.  Then you can
continue to  scroll throught  the series  on the lower half of the
screen, comparing each one to the entry above  it. You  can delete

only the active entry, the one on the lower half of the screen. To
delete an entry, press the Home  key. Whenever  you have completed
your survey  of this series of duplicate names, press the End key.
Address-Book will then proceed to  the  next  series  of duplicate
names. Pressing  the Page  Down key  erases the upper entry at any
time.

DISPLAYING THE LIST
      To display the list  of  names  and  addresses,  select  'D 
Display  the  Name  and  Address  List'  from  the Main Menu. Then
Address-Book will ask you whether  you  want  the  entire personal
list,  the  entire  business  list, just certain categories, or to
search for just one person or company. Whether  you start  with an
entire  list  or  start  with  one person or company, you may then
scroll up and down  through the  entire list  by using  the UP and
DOWN Arrows.  If you  ask for  only particular categories, you are
then asked whether the  list should  display all  entries with any
one of  the categories  that you input, or only those entries with
all of the categories  that  you  input.  Whenever  categories are
selected, only  those entries meeting the requirements will appear
on the screen.

MAKING SPECIAL SEARCH LISTS, PRINTING LISTS AND ADDRESS BOOKS
PREPARING THE LIST
      To print or display an address book or list, you  must first
make  the  proper  list.  From  the  main  menu  select "F  Do Any
Printing Operation" which gets you to the printing menu. This menu
looks like this:

                Jim Smith'S ADDRESS-BOOK PRINTING

      A         Make Printing List
      B         Display Printing List
      C         Print 2-Column Address Book With Normal Print
      D         Print 3-Column Address Book With Small Print
      E         Print Pocket-Sized Address Book
      F         Print Rolodex Cards From List
      G         Prepare Mailing Label File From Print List
      H         Print Mailing Labels From Mailing Label File
      I         Print Form Letters With Names From Mailing File
      X         Return To Main Menu



Then select "A  Make Printing List" to reach the list making menu.

      B         Prepare To Print All Names and Addresses
      C         Prepare List By Particular Categories
      D         Designate Particular Persons
      E         Remove Particular Persons
      F         Prepare List By Notes Phrases

      H         Display Printing List
      I         Change Heading of Printing List
      X         Return To Printing Menu


 First clear  the list  by selecting "A  Clear The Printing List".
Then make your new list.


PREPARING SPECIAL LISTS FOR DISPLAY OR PRINTING
      FlexiNames  has  very   powerful   features   for  selecting
particular  names  for  display  and  printing. You can select the
entire list, as for an address  book. You  can select  those names
that have  any combination  of the  categories on the formal list.
You  may  designate  particular  persons.  When  a  list  has been
prepared by any means, you may remove particular persons from that
list. Lastly, you may select those persons or firms that  have any
logical combination  of the  descriptors that  you have entered as
Notes. 

      To make a display or print list, from  the Main  Menu select
'G   Do Any Printing or Search Operation'. Then from the Search or
Print Menu select 'A   Make Printing  or  Search  List'.  The Make
Print or Search List Menu offers the options for making searches.

      When you choose to designate each person, you scroll through
the list. Pressing the  Home key  puts that  name on  the printing
list and  displays the  next name, while pressing either the Up or
the Down Arrow scrolls you through the list  without accepting any
name.  The  End  key  terminates  the  list.  At  any  time during





                                                                 15
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

preparation of  the list  you may  switch to  viewing the printing
list with either "B  Display Printing List" from the Printing Menu
or "F  Display Printing List"  from the  Printing List Preparation
Menu. You  may also verify whether any particular person is on the
printing list by displaying that  person's  record  from  the Main
Menu. If  Next Mail  is listed  as T,  the person's name is on the
printing list. If you find that  a name  is on  the list  whom you
want to  delete, you  may select  "E  Delete A Name From The Print
List" to delete that person.

      Most of the choices are self-explanatory, but two  need some
explanation. When  you ask  for a  search by categories the screen
asks you whether you want Only One Category, Any One Of The Chosen
Categories, or  Must Be  In All  Of The  Chosen Categories? If you
choose Any One and then enter the categories  of photographers and
members,  the  list  will  contain  all  the  members  and all the
photographers, even though they may not be members.  If you choose
Must Be  In All and then enter photographers and members, the list
will contain only those members who are photographers.

      Searching the Notes for particular combinations  can be very
simple or  quite complex.  You can  use the  logical symbols + for
AND, ^ for OR, ! for  NOT,  and  the  grouping  symbols  (  and ).
Suppose that  you have  used 'rp'  to describe  reporters and that
your separating symbol is ';'. To select all  reporters you merely
enter ;rp;  .   If you want to select those reporters who work for
magazines, for which you use  'mag',  you  enter  ;rp;  +  ;mag; .
Suppose  instead  you  want  to select all print reporters without
selecting radio, 'rad', or  television, 'tv',  reporters. Then you
would enter  (;rp; +  ! ;rad;) +  (;rp; + ! ;tv;) .  If you wanted
to select only television or radio reporters, then you would enter
(;rp; +  ;rad;) ^ (;rp; + ;tv;) . Once you have entered the search
instruction, FlexiNames runs through  the  entire  list  of names,
selecting  each   of  those  that  agrees  with  the  instruction.
Complicated instructions take longer than simple ones.


TITLING A LIST OF ADDRESSES
      Each printed address book has two  titles. The  first is the
title of  the complete  list of  names and addresses, for instance
your own  name  (for  your  personal  list)  or  the  name  of the
organization. The  second title is composed by you to describe the
selection that you have made from the complete  list: for example,
the list of friends who also participate in some sport or the list
of  committee  chairpersons.  You  compose  the  second  title  by
selecting from  the Make Printing List menu the option "G   Change





                                                                 16
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

Heading of Printing List."  This heading  remains in  effect until
you change  it and  it always  appears. If you don't want a second
title, then delete all the characters or enter spaces.

PRINTING AN ADDRESS BOOK FROM THE LIST
      To print an address  book, a  specially-selected list  or an
index  card  list  after  you  have  made  a  print list, load the
appropriate paper into the printer and select the type of printing
that you  desire. If  you have not made a list you will be told to
make a new list.

PRINTING THE 2-COLUMN ADDRESS-BOOK
      The 2-column address book can be  printed with  either 10 or
12 characters per inch at 6 lines per inch. Since the computer has
to layout the entire page before printing the top line, there is a
short delay between pages.

PRINTING THE 3-COLUMN ADDRESS-BOOK
      The 3-column  address-book requires  only half  the pages of
the  2-column  address-book  if  your  printer  can  print  at  15
characters per  inch and  10 lines per inch. The 3 columns require
120 characters,  which equals  8 inches  when printing  at 15 cpi.
Don't use  this format  unless your printer can print at least 120
columns in the size of type that you are using, and you  have wide
enough paper.  You will have to set both the printer codes for the
font and line spacing  and also  the lines  per page  in the setup
operation.

PRINTING THE POCKET-SIZED ADDRESS BOOK
      For  the  pocket-sized  address  book you set the printer to
print in  its smallest  font and  with the  narrowest line spacing
that is  legible. Don't  change the form length, which remains the
length of the paper sheets that you use  (normally 11").  Start by
printing on  only one  side of  the paper  and with  few lines per
page, say 40 (both  selectable during  the setup  operation). Then
print a  short list  of names,  sufficient for two or three pages.
You will see that the pages may be cut to size, both  narrower and
shorter. Reset  the number  of text lines per page so that you can
cut the pages to the length that you want. If you really  want the
minimum-sized book  you can  choose to  print on  both sides. This
requires that you handfeed  individual sheets.  Reset to  print on
both sides.  First cut  the sheets to the correct width, then feed
them through first on  one side  then on  the other.  Finally, cut
them to  proper length.  You may  punch them for a small binder or
staple them together. 






                                                                 17
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

PRINTING MAILING LABELS
      For printing mailing labels or form letters you must prepare
a mailing  label file  from the print list. Before you do, be sure
that you have selected the proper  characters per  inch and copied
the proper  address label file according to the instructions under
Setup. Then  select  "F  Prepare  Mailing  Label  File  From Print
List". You  will be  asked whether  you want the labels printed in
name alphabetical order or in postal code order. If in postal code
order, they  will come  out in  alphabetical order  of nations and
within each nation in order of  postal code.  Then load  the label
stock into  the printer  and select  "G  Print Mailing Labels From
Mailing Label File." Address-Book  will print  sample labels until
you get the stock properly aligned, then will print the labels.


PRINTING FORM LETTERS
      Form  letters  are  individually-addressed letters. You must
first prepare a master letter that  specifies the  location of the
date,  the  recipient's  title  and  name,  and  the four lines of
address. The form letter codes are as follows:

      ^1        Recipient's title and name
      ^2        First line of address
      ^3        Second line of address
      ^4        Third Line of address
      ^5        Fourth line of address
      ^6        Date of letter

      Word processors normally insert non-standard invisible codes
into their  files to  tell that  particular word  processor how to
display and print that  document.  Since  these  are non-standard,
FlexiNames, like other programs, can't understand them. Therefore,
most word processors have  a text-only  or non-document  mode that
produces files  that have  only the standard ASCII characters: the
printable characters plus space,  carriage  return  and linespace.
(You can  print this  instruction manual  directly on your printer
because it is transmitted  to  you  in  the  straight-ASCII mode.)
Prepare your  letter with  your word processor. Where you want the
date, type in ^6; where you want the  recipient's title  and name,
type in ^1. If any addresses in your print list require five lines
for the name and address, type in all the codes from ^2 to ^5, one
beneath the other, in the place for the address. 









                                                                 18
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

Here's a sample form letter:

                                             ^6

      ^1
      ^2
      ^3
      ^4
      ^5

      Dear ^1:

      This is  a test letter to illustrate the form letter system.
      Read it with the interest that it deserves.

                                            Yours truly, 
                                            etc., etc.

      Prepare your form letter with your word processor  as in the
above example  and then  convert it  into a straight-ASCII or non-
document  file.  Then  copy  that  straight-ASCII  file  into  the
directory that  contains the  Address-Book under  the file name of
LETTER.TXT.  Address-Book will  print a  letter for  each name and
address in  its mailfile, using either name alphabetical or postal
code order, as you specified when making the list.

      You have  the option  of either  using preprinted letterhead
paper or  of having  the printer  print a letterhead at the top of
each sheet. The letterhead is set up from  the main  menu with the
"J  Change  Categories  and  Letterhead"  option.  Each  different
address-book has its own letterhead, so that you can have  one for
business and  another for  personal use  if you  keep the names in
separate address books.

      You can then print mailing labels  for the  letters from the
same list.


SETTING UP YOUR CALENDARS
      The  distribution  disk  has  one calendar on it, MTCAL, the
Empty Calendar. To start your first calendar, select  the Calendar
from the FlexiCal Program Menu. Then select "J  Change The List Of
Calendars." Then follow the  instructions below  for adding  a new
calendar. FlexiCal  will print  the calendars and the datebooks in
different fonts if your printer has that capability. The date book
is  best  printed  on  8.5  inch wide paper with 10 characters per





                                                                 19
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

inch, but the calendars may be printed in any pitch. You enter the
appropriate  printer  control  codes  through  the  "I  Set Up The
Calendar and Address-Book Systems" option from  the Address-Book's
Main Menu.  Read the  section on  setting up  the Address-Book for
instructions on how to enter printer control codes.


ADDING A NEW CALENDAR
From  the  Calendar  Main  Menu  select  "J  Change  The  List  Of
Calendars." Then  select A  for Adding. For Short Name select some
easy-to-remember and easy-to-type set  of  letters,  such  as your
initials, because  this is  how you  will open  this calendar. For
Name enter any name that you  like. This  name will  appear at the
top of all screens and printouts. You next have six characters for
a file name. Enter a name that will remind you  of what  that file
is when you next look at the directory. Naturally, use a name that
is different from that of  any  other  calendar  or  address book.
Don't worry  about remembering  it; the only one that you ought to
remember is the initial  set of  initials, and  even then FlexiCal
will show it to you if you forget. If you prefer to see your dates
as Month-Day-Year, enter A for American dates. If  you prefer Day-
Month-Year, enter  B for  British. Now that you have created a new
calendar, you may  select  it  from  the  main  menu  by selecting
"I  Choose A New Calendar" and then keying in its short name.


DELETING A CALENDAR
      You may  delete any  calendar that is not the currently open
calendar. Once you have started and selected your own calendar you
may delete the MTCal. From the main menu select "J  Change List of
Calendars" and then select Delete. Key  in the  short name  of the
calendar that  you wish  to delete. Since one calendar must always
be open and you cannot delete the open  calendar, you  always have
one calendar on the list. If you use only one calendar but want to
delete it, create an empty calendar  (call it  MTCAL if  you like)
select it, and then delete your own calendar.


OPERATING THE CALENDAR
      Operating the  Calendar is straightforward. If you have made
only one calendar, commanding the Calendar  moves you  directly to
your  own  calendar.  If  you  have  made  more than one calendar,
commanding the Calendar lists  the calendars  that you  have made,
from which you select the one that you want.

From the Calendar Menu you can select:

A   Display Calendar               J   Print Past Events Journal

H   Delete Early Events            Q   Back-Up This Calendar
I   Display Past Events Journal    X   Exit Calendar Menu


ADDING A NEW EVENT
      When entering  a new  event you  enter the date, the time of
day, and the description.  For events  that have  no time  of day,
such as  a birthday,  enter 0   hours  and 0  minutes and FlexiCal
won't print a time of day. The question  "Delete When  Time Past?"
differentiates  between  events  and  tasks.  Events (like "John's
Birthday") will be  deleted  whenever  you  command  "Delete Early
Events" and they are earlier than the given date. Tasks (like "Pay
Taxes")  won't  be   automatically   deleted   until   you  either
individually delete  them or reclassify them as events. When their
dates have passed, they stay at the top of the  calendar to remind
you to do them, until you individually delete them. When you close
the description by <Enter>  or  by  filling  the  illuminated box,
FlexiCal asks  you whether you need more space. If you do, another
line for description is added. You  can  use  up  to  20  lines of
description. 


ADDING A SERIES OF EVENTS
      Adding a series of events is the same as adding one new one,
except that you have only one  line  of  description  and  you are
asked  which  repetition  cycle  you  desire and for how long. The
repetition cycles are weekly, same date of each month, same day of
same week  for each  month, or last day of each month. New entries
are added to cover the time-span until the date that  you give. No
further events  are added.  To extend the series you have to enter
the first event of the new series.

CHANGING AN EVENT, RESCHEDULING AN EVENT
      When changing any information  about an  engagement that was
previously  entered,  you  don't  have  to enter the date and time
accurately. FlexiCal seeks out the first event after  the date and





                                                                 21
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

time that  you enter,  and then asks whether this the proper event
to change. If it is not, it will show you  the next  event and the
next until you command either to make the change or to exit.

ENTERING ANNIVERSARIES
      Selecting  "M  Anniversary  Information"  from the Main Menu
gives you the choice  of  adding  or  deleting  an  anniversary or
viewing the  file of anniversaries. When adding an anniversary you
enter the original date of the series (for a birthday, the date of
birth)  and  the  description.  When  you  next start the Calendar
program the latest appearances of that anniversary will  appear on
your schedule.  Probably one  will be  earlier in the current year
and one in next year. The one that is earlier  will disappear when
you  delete  early  events.  From  then  on  until you delete that
anniversary record, it will appear,  giving  the  proper  age, one
year before its date. 

DISPLAYING THE CALENDAR
      When displaying  the calendar you will be shown the earliest
date to start but you may enter a  later date  if you  desire. The
screen will  show about 10 events at a time, and you key in Y or N
to ask for more and to terminate the display.

PRINTING YOUR CALENDAR OF ENGAGEMENTS
      Just be sure that the printer has paper and is Selected (On-
Line) when you command the print.

PRINTING THE ANNUAL CALENDAR
      Just be sure that the printer has paper and is Selected (On-
line) when you command the print. The screen will ask you to enter
the year for the calendar in four digits.

PRINTING THE DATEBOOK
      Just be sure that the printer has paper and is Selected (On-
line) when you command the print.  There are  two formats  for the
datebook. The screen will ask you to input the year in four digits
and to say whether you wish  the  plain  or  folded  datebook. The
plain or  unfolded format prints a pair of months on each sheet of
paper and can be done either with continuous paper or with handfed
sheets.

      The folded  format datebook can only be printed with handfed
sheets because it prints on both sides of the sheets to save bulk.
Have  a  sheet  in  the  printer  when  starting. As each sheet is
printed, the screen will tell you whether to  turn that  sheet and
reinsert it,  just as if you were typing on the back of the sheet,





                                                                 22
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

or to insert a new sheet. Once the  sheets are  printed, fold them
horizontally in  half and  cut along the fold with a knife, letter
opener or scissors. Assemble the sheets  with the  cover first and
the months  in order.  Staple close to the left-hand edge and fold
the booklet in half. 


DELETING EARLY EVENTS AND CREATING THE JOURNAL
      Whenever more  events  have  passed  than  you  wish  to see
displayed,  you  may  delete  all  events before the date and time
which you  specify. FlexiCal  does check  the current  date in the
computer  (you  have  to  keep  that accurate) so that it will not
delete any events  after  yesterday.  As  these  events  are being
deleted, FlexiCal  transfers them  to the Journal to form a record
of what you have done (or at least, have intended to do).

DISPLAYING AND PRINTING THE JOURNAL
      The Journal is displayed and printed  in the  same format as
the Calendar;  you just  make the  appropriate selections from the
Calendar Menu. The Journal accumulates events just as  long as you
want it  to. It  might get quite long if you have a busy schedule.
At appropriate times, once a week, month or quarter, print out the
entire  Journal  for  your  permanent  record and then empty it by
selecting "K  Empty Past Events Journal'. 


SETTING UP THE RUNNER'S DIARY
      You must enter some data  on  runners  before  recording any
runs. When  first started,  selecting "A  Screen Summary Report of
Runners" will display 20 lines empty  of data.  Each one  of those
lines can  hold the summary data for one runner. The run recording
operation won't accept data unless the runner has  previously been
listed on  a summary  line. So  you must first list yourself. From
the menu select "H  Change List of Runners." The  screen shows the
20 lines with the selection menu of C to Change position, A to Add
Data, D to Delete Data, and X to Exit. 

Changing Sequence
      The number at the left margin is a sequence number. You will
always have  20 lines,  but you may number the lines from 1 to 99.
This enables you to shift the  sequence of  the lines  through the
"C  Change Position"  selection so  the information will appear in
any  sequence  that  you  desire.  If  you  inadvertently  give  a
duplicate number,  you will see two entries of the same number and
you can separate them by renumbering the first one.

Entering Runners
      By selecting A for Adding New Data and then the desired line
number, you can enter each runner for which you want reports. When
you enter run reports, you will  name the  runner with  these two-
character names,  so make these easy to remember. All letters will
be converted to upper case for  ease of  entry. The  short name is
short so that it can appear in the body of reports, while the full
name will appear at summaries. 

SELECTING THE DATE FORMAT
      As with the Calendar,  you can  select the  format for entry
and display  of dates. From the menu select "J--Select Date Format
and Climb Equivalent" and  enter either  A for  American or  B for
British date  format. Then enter either E for English measurements
(miles and feet) or  M  for  Metric  measurements  (kilometers and
meters). Selecting  the measurement  unit changes  only the labels
attached to the numbers for display  or printout,  not the numbers
themselves. Therefore,  you should  not change  from one system to
the other while you have data in the files.

SELECTING THE CLIMB EQUIVALENT
      The Climb Equivalent is the amount of elevation gain that is
approximately equal  to a  mile (or  kilometer) on  the level. The
stronger you are and the harder  you run,  the less  the effect of
hills so  you can climb more for the same effort as running a mile
on the  level. Conversely,  the slower  that you  normally run the
harder the  hills feel. For runners, approximately 300 to 500 feet
of elevation gain are approximately equal in effort  to a  mile on
the  level.  When  using  the  metric  system  50 to 100 meters of
elevation gain are  approximately  equal  to  a  kilometer  on the
level. For  hikers, the  Climb Equivalent  may be  as high as 1000
feet for a mile or 200  meters for  a kilometer.  Choose the value
that  suits  your  style.  From  the  menu  select "J  Select Date
Format, Climb Equivalent and  Miles-or-Kilometers"  and  enter the
Climb Equivalent that suits your style.

PRINTING RUN REPORT BLANKS
      The Run  Report Blank Forms allow you to write down your run
reports whenever you return from a run, so you can enter them into
the computer  later in  a bunch. Selecting from the menu "I--Print
Diary Blank Forms" starts the printer  printing blank  forms. Each
page holds 14 reports, so just print a few pages at a time. 

ADDING RUN REPORTS
      When adding a run report you key in the date, the miles, the
runner and description. You may  also  key  in  the  time  and the





                                                                 24
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

elevation gain.  If the  runner has not been listed on the summary
screen you will be asked to enter that information and reenter the
run information.  When you finish one line of description you will
be asked if you meed more. You have about 20 lines available.

      Entering a  run  report  automatically  adds  the  miles and
increases the number of rune for the runner on the summary screen.

DISPLAY OF ONE RUN REPORT
      Whenever any  run is displayed on the screen or printed on a
report it will show  the  date,  the  miles,  the  runner  and the
description of the ride. If you have entered the time, you will be
given the average speed.  If  you  have  keyed  in  both  time and
elevation  gain  you  will  also  be given an equivalent flat-land
speed as corrected for the elevation gain.

REPORTS OF RUNS
      Both the screen and the printed report for one runner follow
the same  format. You are asked for the two-character abbreviation
of the runner and the starting and ending  dates. The  report will
show, either  on the  screen or  on the printout, all the runs for
that runner between those  dates, and  will finish  with the total
rides, total  miles, average  miles per  ride and  total elevation
gain for that period.

REPORT FOR ALL RUNNERS
      The printed report for  all runners  covers all  runners for
the total  time of  the active file. The first page is a duplicate
of the screen summary.  Then follow  reports for  each runner with
totals at its close. 

DELETING A RUN REPORT
      When preparing  to delete  a run report you don't have to be
accurate about the date. FlexiCal will display the  next run after
the date  that you  give, and  will ask  if this  is the run to be
deleted. If it isn't, you may see the next run and the next, until
you find the one to be deleted or realize that it isn't there.

FINDING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS
      You enter  the latitude  and longitude  of your location and
its time zone relative to Universal Mean Time (Greenwich or London
time).  Latitude   and  longitude   are  given   in  atlasses  and
gazetteers; you need know  these only  to a  half or  quarter of a
degree. For  the United  States, Eastern Time is -5 hours, Central
Time is -6 hours, Mountain Time is -7 hours, and  Pacific Time is-
8  hours.  For  other  places,  time zones are usually in terms of





                                                                 25
Personal Miles Instruction Manual

hours, but a few are in  terms  of  half  hours.  The  progam will
convert any time you give it to the nearest hour or half hour. You
will also need to know  whether  summer  time  is  in  effect, and
whether it is 1 hour or (unusually) 2 hours.

      From   the   Main   Menu   select   "S  Sunrise  and  Sunset
Calculator." Then select N  for a  New Location,  and you  will be
asked to  key in the latitude, longitude, time zone and the amount
of summer time. You may save  this information  if you  wish. Then
you key  in the  month and  day and  the program  replies with the
times of sunrise and sunset. You may repeat giving dates  for this
location  as  long  as  you  wish,  or  you many change to another
location.

      The sunrise and sunset times are  calculated for  an average
year. However,  years differ slightly because of the succession of
regular and leap years  that  keeps  the  calendar  correct. These
differences and  others may produce errors of two or three minutes
on any day.


BACKING UP DATA FOR ALL FUNCTIONS
      Backing-up data means to copy your data to a floppy disk and
storing that  disk in  a safe  place so  that you have two copies.
With a dual-floppy system you merely diskcopy or copy *.* the data
disk to  another disk.  With a hard-disk system you use the backup
funtions from the menus. There are  two levels  of backup.  If you
backup from  the FlexiCal  menu you will copy all the data for all
the calendars, all the address-books  and  all  the  runs.  If you
backup from  the Address-Book,  Calendar or Running menus you will
copy only the data for that  particular Address-Book  or Calendar,
or all the Running data. You do whichever best suits your purpose.

RESTORING LOST DATA
      If you  use a  hard disk that crashes and destroys data, you
may restore your data to the  last backup.  On the  new hard disk,
set up  the same  directory as  you had  before for FlexiCal. Then
copy the program and initial files from the original program disk.
Then list  the files  that are  on the  Backup disk.  The names of
these files will tell you the names of the calendars  and address-
books that you had. Call up the FlexiCal program and add the names
of the calendars and  address-books just  as if  you were starting
afresh. This gets them listed in the AddBooks and Cals files. Then
Restore from the Backup disk to the FlexiCal  directory. This will
replace the  blank files with files that contain the data from the
last backup.

                 UPDATING THE FLEXICAL CALENDAR

                     AND ADDRESS-BOOK FILES

                  PREPARED BY PREVIOUS VERSIONS

                         OF THE PROGRAMS

             FLEXICAL, FLEXICALNAMES, PERSONAL MILES








                                                                 ii
Updating the FlexiCal Calendar and Address-Book Files


DO YOU NEED TO UPDATE ANY FILES?

      These instructions  are for  only those  users who have used
previous versions of FlexiCal, FlexiCalNames or Personal Miles and
wish to continue to use the same data files.

      You  may  have  to  make  up  to  four  updating operations,
depending on which version  of the  program you  started with. You
can tell  which of  the four  you need  to make  by making certain
tests with the new version that you have  just received.  The test
for  each  condition  and  the  appropriate updating procedure are
described below.

YOU DON'T HAVE CALENDAR JOURNAL FILES
      You test  for  the  absence  of  calendar  journal  files by
starting  the  calendar  and  selecting  'I   Display  Past Events
Journal'.
If  the  program  fails  and  presents  the  notice   'OPEN  ERROR
??????JN.DBF FILE'  [here the  ?????? represents the name you have
given to calendar files],  you  don't  yet  have  calendar journal
files.

      You need  to have one set of calendar journal files for each
calendar that you operate.  One file  will be  named ??????JN.DBF,
the other  ??????JX.NTX, where ?????? represents the name that you
have given to  each  calendar  that  you  operate.  To  make these
instructions clearer  let's assume  that one  set of your calendar
files is named MYCAL. To make journal files for the calendar whose
files are  named MYCAL  you copy  the file MYCAL.DBF to a new file
named MYCALJN.DBF and copy the  file  MYCALDX.NTX  to  a  new file
named MYCALJX.NTX. The DOS command for the first operation is COPY
MYCAL.DBF  MYCALJN.DBF,  and  for  the  second  operation  is COPY
MYCALDX.NTX  MYCALJX.NTX.  Then  restart  the  Calendar and select
'K   Empty Past Events  Journal'.  This  will  give  you  an empty
journal which  will be  filled each  time you  delete past events.
Repeat this operation for each calendar that you operate.


YOU CAN'T DISPLAY THE LIST OF NAMES AND ADDRESSES 
      You test for the  older  version  of  address-book  files by
starting the  address-book and selecting 'D   Display the Name and
Address List'. If the program fails and presents the error message
'UNIDENTIFIED ITEM   REVDATE'  you have  the older  version of the
Address-Book files that doesn't  contain the  review date  of each
record.





                                                                iii
Updating the FlexiCal Calendar and Address-Book Files

      To  correct  the  problem  you  need to install the new file
format version and then update  the  files.  First,  copy  the new
version of  the file  BKSTRUC.DBF that is on the new disk that you
have just received to the floppy disk or  hard-disk directory that
contains your address-book files. Then start the Address-Book. You
must then update the files for each address-book that you operate.
Select  'K   Setup  Address-Book  and  Calendar  Systems'  and run
through the setup operation without making  any changes  until you
come to  the question 'Do you need to update the files?'. Answer Y
for yes  and Address-Book  will update  the files  for you. Repeat
this setup operation for each address-book that you operate.


YOU CAN'T DO LOGICAL SEARCHES BY PHRASES
      To test  whether you  have the files that enable you to make
logical searches, start the Address-Book and move to  the menu for
making a  print or search list. Select 'G   Print List of Logical-
Search Notes Phrases'. If the  program    fails  and  presents the
error message  'OPEN ERROR     PHRASES.DBF' you don't yet have the
proper files.

      To correct  the  problem,  copy  the  files  PHRASES.DBF and
PHDEX.NTX that you received on your new disk to the floppy disk or
hard-disk directory that contains your address-book files.

YOU HAVE OLDER CYCLING  OR RUNNING  DIARY FILES  THAT WON'T BACKUP
INDIVIDUALLY
      This situation applies only to users of FlexiCal or Personal
Miles. Test for this situation  by  looking  at  the  directory in
which you  keep your  FlexiCal or Personal Miles files. If none of
the files start  with  the  ~  character  you  need  to  update by
changing some file names.

      The  early   Personal  Miles  used  files  named  RIDES.DBF,
RIDESUM.DBF, ABBDEX.NTX, BIKEDEX.NTX, CYCDEX.NTX,  RIDEDEX.NTX AND
SUMDEX.NTX.  These  files  need  to  be  renamed  by  adding the ~
character  before  each   name.   Thus,   RIDES.DBF   must  become
~RIDES.DBF. The DOS command to rename this file is:

REN RIDES.DBF ~RIDES.DBF.

Repeat this for each of the above-named files.

      The  early  FlexiCal  used files named RUNS.DBF, RUNSUM.DBF,
PERSDEX.NTX,  RUNDEX.NTX,  RUNRDEX.NTX,  SUMRDEX.NTX.  These files
need to  be renamed  by adding  the ~  character before each name.





                                                                 iv
Updating the FlexiCal Calendar and Address-Book Files
Thus, RUNS.DBF must become ~RUNS.DBF, and  so on.  The DOS command
to rename this file is:

REN RUNS.DBF ~RUNS.DBF.

Repeat this for each of the above-named files.
