## Information about "PCC PERSONAL C COMPILER"

    The PERSONAL C COMPILER (PCC) is a fast and compact C compiler package
    with a lot of power.
    
    PCC builds ``small model'' only: 64K of code, 64K data (which can be
    bypassed), and 64K stack executables from Kernigan and Ritchie standard
    C language source.  It comes with compiler, Assembler, linker, library
    utility, standard library, debugger, editor, and includes sample files.
    PCC is not a bare bones system; it supports overlays, has an 8087
    library, a library of supplemental screen I/O routines, and a special
    data type to break the 64K limit.  The documentation is indexed, very
    complete and is a good learning tool for the beginning C programmer.
    
    Most importantly, PCC produces small and efficient code very quickly,
    and even though it is not a fancy ``optimizing'' compiler with lots of
    bells and whistles, it's all a true programmer really needs.
    
    NOTE:  The librarian and the Xarray memory capability are
    not included with shareware version.
