## Information about "DNDBBS 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1676)"

    DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM creates an entire new world
    on your computer and lets people call in through a modem and play DNDBBS
    via the telephone lines.
    
    DNDBBS can operate by itself on the modem, as a part of another
    bulletin board system, or as a single-user game on the computer.
    Instructions are included for making this program an on-line game in a
    door of an RBBS.  DNDBBS already has a world created for people to play
    in, but the system is expandable.  You, as dungeon master, can edit and
    create more scenarios, rooms, treasures, and monsters, just like the
    game itself.
    
    Players who call in enter their name and password, and if calling for
    the first time they can create their own character.  Character classes
    include fighter, magic user, cleric, thief, ranger, paladin, druid, and
    dungeon master (you, of course).  Assistant dungeon masters are allowed
    to help you manage the system.  Before players begin the adventure, some
    welcome and notice files are displayed on the screen to introduce the
    game.  Players can then explore, kill monsters, cast spells, find
    treasure, etc.  When a player character dies, he is resurrected by the
    high priests in the clerical sanctuary, and can then enter the adventure
    again, but with decreased character abilities.  As dungeon master, you
    are given some additional powers, such as the ability to teleport any
    player to any room while the user is on-line, edit or delete users, make
    a player invisible (thus invulnerable to all monster attacks), and
    configure log-on and general system parameters for the game.
    
    DNDBBS not only makes it much easier to manage and play a fantasy role-
    playing game, but also can be an extension of your own imagination.
