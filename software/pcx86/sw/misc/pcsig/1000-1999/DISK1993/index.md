## Information about "FILE-SAFE"

    You know you should back up your files regularly, but you never seem to
    get around to it.  FILE-SAFE will help you remember.  Loaded in your
    autoexec.bat, it will tell you what files need backing up according to
    how often you told it to remind you.
    
    You pre-select directories/files to be backed up and frequencies for
    each.  When this backup program is included in the autoexec.bat file,
    the system automatically scans a master file of backup schedules and
    presents only those items needing backup.  If no backups are needed, the
    program returns directly to DOS.
    
    Entries needing backup are presented in menu form with single key
    selection of backup parameters along with information about previous
    backups.  Parameters are saved with each backup and offered as the
    default selection on successive backup runs until changed.  At any time,
    the program can be forced to display, for backup action, all
    directories/files in its master configuration file.
    
    Results of every backup attempt are saved in a history file containing
    date and time of activity, results (successful, or if not, why not),
    and, for successful backups, the label of the backup disk.  You also
    have full control over maintaining your backups and restoration.
