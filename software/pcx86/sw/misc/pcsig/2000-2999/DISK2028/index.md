## Information about "LASER UTILITIES"

    TILES is a soft font for the HP LaserJet II printer.  It is not an
    "Alpha-Numeric" font, instead it replaces the normal character set with
    a series of random graphic symbols.  The font is used in the "Portrait"
    orientation.  Installing the font is very simple; just copy the file
    TILES.LOD to your laser printer and you are ready to go.  Also on the
    disk are all of the programs used to create the font or modify it.
    Using these programs to modify the font or to create your own requires
    some 'C' programming knowledge.
    
    LASER ENVELOPE PRINTER is a very simple utility to print address
    information on envelopes using an HP LaserJet II printer.  This program
    is extremely easy to use; the user is allowed 3 lines of text for the
    return address and 5 lines for the destination.  The program will save
    your return address on disk, and will import an ASCII mailing list file
    when named on the command line. There is no documentation with this
    program and none is needed; simply run the program and follow the
    instructions on the screen.  LASER ENVELOPE PRINTER uses whatever font
    you have selected from your printer keypad - internal, soft, or
    cartidge.
    
    SEND2LJ is a printer utility program used to send commands, fonts, and
    text files to your HP LaserJet II printer.  The operation of the program
    is simple, just enter your commands into a text file (using your
    favorite text editor) following the documented format, and the program
    will add the needed escape character wherever you have indicated when
    sending the command file to the printer.  The documentation is fairly
    simple, and the disk contains a sample command file for you to try
    (provided you have the softfont specified in the command file handy).
    The program, as designed, is set up to work on printers hooked up to the
    LPT1 port; to change this requires some programming knowledge.
    
    LASER LABEL is a simple utility for printing diskette labels on an HP
    LASERJET II printer. The program reads the directory of files on
    a
    floppy disk and then sorts and prints them (along with a user-defined
    title and description) on AVERY #5161 laser printer diskette labels.
    LASERLBL allows the user to download different fonts for both the title
    and file name areas of the label. There are no documentation files on
    this disk. All of the information you need to use this program is on

ENVELOPE PRINTER uses only one font which is pre-set by the program and

LASER LABEL is a simple utility for printing diskette labels on an HP   
LASERJET II printer.  The program reads the directory of files on a

Title and Description) on AVERY #5161 laser printer diskette labels.    
The labels must be separated vertically for the required manual feeding.
The program allows the user to select different fonts for both the Title
and File name areas of the label.  There are no documentation files on  
this disk, all the information you need to use this program is included 
on screen when you run it.
