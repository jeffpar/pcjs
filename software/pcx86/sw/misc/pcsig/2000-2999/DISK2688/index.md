Disk No: 2688
Disk Title: WALLMAC
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: Wallmac
Author Version: 07/90
Author Registration: $2.00
Special Requirements: Windows 3.0

If you are tired of the wallpaper files that come with Windows, check
out these two new background screens that you can use to customize your
desktop with, and even impress Mac users.

You get the original monochrome Macintosh(tm) background screen, and the
newer color Mac II (tm), to use instead of the ribbons, paper, and other
backgrounds that Windows offers you. These two BMP screens "look so
realistic that you will find yourself reaching for the pull-down menus!"
