    ~ Converts from several other popular data formats, like fixed-length,
    ASCII and "FileExpress."
    
    ~ Reads/writes industry standard .DBF files.
    
    ~ Will create an input screen from your .DBF file.
    
    ~ Handles over 2.1 BILLION records, limited only by disk space.
    
    ~ Full tutorial for the database novice. "DR" program is included to
    create a meaningful database of all the files on any hard or floppy
    drive.
    
    ~ Quickly create from, or match to, a database from an existing form.
    
    ~ On-line manual and extensive context-sensitive Help.
