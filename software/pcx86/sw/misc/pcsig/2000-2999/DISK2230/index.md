## Information about "VGA SHARKS"

    An underwater action arcade game that utilizes unique Artificial
    Intelligence, simulation and classic animation techniques to transform
    your computer screen into a realistic ocean floor.  This the VGA
    version of ALIVE SHARKS.
    
    You are the Frogman and your mission is to collect rare marine
    creatures and recover lost treasures from the bottom of the sea. Armed
    with your trusty stun-gun, you can retreat to your electromagnetic base
    that repels sharks and the rest of your dreadful enemies.  Your diving
    uniform is state-of-the-art, but you can survive only a few shark bites
    and it is useless against the poison of the deadly
    jellyfish.
    
    This is not your typical "shoot-em-up," "eat-the-dots" kind of game.
    Your enemies are crafty and independent and they surround you in clever
    formations.  When you shoot at them from far away, they are smart enough
    to avoid your shot.
