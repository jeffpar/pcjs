## Information about "WYNDFIELDS"

    WYNDFIELDS is a good general-purpose database program for those of us
    who don't need all the fancy features. Yet it runs by pull-down menus
    making it even easier to use and understand.
    
    Creating and printing mailing labels or detailed reports can be
    accomplished painlessly from within the program. Multiple indices are
    maintained automatically for you, and several methods are available for
    extracting the information you need. For more advanced users,
    WYNDFIELDS also offers extensive string and math functions for use in
    searches and calculated fields.
    
    WYNDFIELDS has full mouse support; context-sensitive, cross-referenced
    help screens; import/export capabilities; and mail merge files
    compatible with most popular word processors -- features you might not
    expect in such a basic database.
    
    Databases created with WYNDFIELDS can have 70 different fields, 2
    billion records, and 10 different indices, each with 10 key fields in
    either ascending or descending order.
