## Information about "BIKEINFO"

    If you're into cycling and want accurate performance statistics about
    your bike and your ride, BIKEINFO is a program which generates speed and
    gear ratio characteristics of a multi-speed bicycle (such as a 10, 12 or
    18 speed bicycle).
    
    The user is required to input the size of the tires in inches and the
    number of gear teeth in the front and rear gears (i.e. the chain rings
    and the sprockets).  The program will then generate information like the
    gear ratios for the different speeds, and the miles per hour for
    different cadences such as 60 and 90 pedals per minute.
