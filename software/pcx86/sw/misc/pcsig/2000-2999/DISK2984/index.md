                       BACKGROUND AND GOAL

The Comet Halistrom is a periodic comet that passes the planet of 
Yorland  every  several hundred years.  It would destroy  all  on 
this  planet  if not for the three Sun Spheres  that  resided  on 
Shandola.  These three spheres put out a shield that protects the 
planet from the comet's rays.

Many  generations ago a terrible race, only known as The  Menace, 
came  to this planet.  They began in the Northwestern portion  of 
the  world  to conquer Yorland, island by island.  They  got  the 
idea to steal the Spheres and hide them.  They intended to  leave 
the  planet until the comet passed, destroying all on the  planet 
and  then  returning  to replace the Spheres and  take  over  the 
planet with minimal effort.

They  did obtain the Spheres but a great storm blew their  armada 
to  far corners of the world.  Instead of removing  the  Spheres, 
they hid them on the planet and then, those that survived,  left.  
Generations  came  and passed.  From fear of the Terror,  no  one 
would  travel  on  the seas until finally  the  Yorax  and  their 
splintered tribes ventured out in their sailing vessels.  For the 
most  part  they were a hostile tribe but not all  factions  were 
pirates.   Those  that  would  fly flags  were  friendly  to  the 
islanders.   Only those not flying a flag proved to  be  pirates.  
Closer and closer came the date the comet was due to return.  

Into the land Braun is born to the ruler of Holm Island.  He  and 
an  old  salt (who has sailed about Holm Island and  to  Shandola 
only)  set  out to explore those seas that  no  civilized  nation 
would  venture on for many years.  He only has an old chart  with 
some  of the islands charted and an old star chart to guide  him.  
He will meet the Yorax, both friendly and hostile.  His quest  is 
to  find  the  three Sun Spheres and return them one  by  one  to 
Shandola  in a effort to get all three in place before the  final 
one hundred days pass and Halistom returns.

You are Braun and this is your quest.... Good Luck.

                          INTRODUCTION

First Expedition is a real-time first-person adventure.  It takes 
place on an ocean world with you at the helm of an explorer craft 
navigating to known islands and searching out unknown islands.  

You are operating with a boat of specific food and fuel capacity. 
The  food capacity is the number of days of food you have.   Food 
and  fuel can be obtained from various islands.  You  start  with 
some  cash to purchase your supplies up to the capacity limit  of 
your craft.  To make such purchases, you must land at the pier of 
an  island.   Some  islands have piers  and  others  don't.   The 
shoreline  of each island may provide food at no cost or  may  be 
hostile  causing you to lose food and fuel.  You  will  certainly 
note these conditions as your explorations take you to  different 
islands.   Each  day  is intended to be  approximately  an  eight 
minute  period.  A parameter permits you to adjust the  speed  of 
the  game for your machine.  During the day, food is  taken  from 
the  supplies.   The world being explored is measured  20,000  by 
20,000  units.   Longitude  and latitude are  measured  by  these 
coordinates for plotting on the Island Charts.  


                 *****  SUPPORT PACKET  *****

The materials supporting your adventure are listed below and will 
be sent upon receipt of the registration  fee plus  shipping  and
handling.   See  the  README.DOC  file for the registration form.
These  items  are  not  in a form that can be included on a disk.

First Expedition is intended to  involve the explorer  with  some
degree of manual charting and  is  thus  best enjoyed  using  the
supporting charts and tools which are  listed below.  With these,
First  Expedition  becomes  an experience unlike any available on 
the market today.

Island Charts:

The Island Chart covers the entire world`s surface and shows  the 
best known position of the known islands.  Part of your adventure 
is seeking out and finding islands not known  at  the  time  this 
chart was reconstructed.  The units of longitude and latitude are
given along the edges of the charts in thousands of units.   Each
small square is 100 by 100 units.

Star Chart/Star Catalogue:

This one page-chart gives the star configuration over the planet.  
It  is  essential to navigation and is used along with  the  Star 
Catalogue which provides the corresponding planet coordinates for 
some of the stars.  On the backside is a keyboard layout.  If you
have an Epson compatible printer you can create a printout of the
Star Chart and Catalogue by running STARS at the DOS prompt.

Compass:

The circular compass with the arm is used to plot the heading for 
traveling from one point to another on the surface of the  world.  
By  placing the compass centered at your current  position  (with 

Page 2

North  at the top) and swinging the arm about to align with  your 
desired  destination, you determine the necessary heading to  set 
your  craft  on.   The compass is also  used  to  determine  your 
position at night using the night sky.  More on this later.

The Years of Terror:

This booklet contains the history behind Braun's First Expedition 
along  with  information that will provide hints on  solving  the 
adventure.

First  Expedition  will run and is fully functional as is without
the support packet. The above items provide the tools to navigate
and better understand the adventure.  Note that you can make your
own version of the Star Chart and Catalogue on an  Epson  printer
by running STARS at the DOS prompt.  The printer must be  NOT  be
set for IBM printer emulation mode (DIP switch setting).

The  adventure begins at Holm Island with a class-1 craft  and  a 
sum of money.  Through the trading function you can buy and  sell 
items needed for your journey.  Money is gained in the  following 
ways:

o  Sink a pirate.  The higher your skill level of  shooting,  the 
   greater the money gained.

o  Find an person willing to help fund you quest.

o  Find money hidden in mazes.

o  Sell something.

The money you gather will be needed to buy supplies at piers.  If 
you  are  able to save up enough you can buy  a  larger  capacity 
craft to conduct your further explorations with. 

The  following sections will help you to start up  the  adventure 
and take you on a tour of the instrumentation of the  exploration 
craft.

                             SCREENS


There  are  a  number  of  graphic  screens  possible  in   First 
Expedition.  These screens are briefly described below.

                           Stern View

The  stern view shows you the stern of the boat and the  horizon.  
It is selected by the function key F10 while 'at sea'.

                         Instrument View

This is a forward view as is the bow view only here you have  the 
instrument panel laid out along the bottom of the screen.  It  is 
selected by the function key F6 while 'at sea'.

                            Top View

When  the explorer craft is close to landing at an island,  First 
Expedition  automatically puts the display into Top  View.   This 
screen  shows  the  island as green with the boat as  a  red  dot 
moving  on the blue sea.  The instrument panel is laid out  along 
the bottom of the screen as in the Instrument View.  While in top 
view, you cannot select the other previous views.  

                            Night Sky

The  night sky view is available from any of the  previous  views 
via  the  N-key.  It shows the night sky  which  is  needed  for 
navigation.   Of course, the night sky view can only be  selected 
at  night (yes, there is day and night).  Much more on night  sky 
and navigation later.


                           Radar Scan

A  radar  scan  is taken by firing a  rocket.   This  produces  a 
'snapshot' of the area about the craft.  As the rocket ascends it 
scans  the  ocean  surface about the  craft  for  a  considerable 
distance (1000 units is each direction) and, via telemetry, sends 
its  data back to the ship.  Once this data is stored  on  board, 
the  explorer may call it up on the screen.  The details of  this 
screen  are discussed under the function of the same name,  Radar 
Scan.

                       LANDING AT ISLANDS

Landing  at an island is made by moving the red dot  representing 
the craft up to make contact with the shore of the island or into 
contact  with a pier.  Landings are made while the display is  in 
top view with the boat showing as a red dot.

Each  island may or may not have natives which may or may not  be 
hostile.  Some  islands  may not have  food.   Natives  and  food 
availability  pertain only to the island proper.  That  is,  when 
landing at the shore of an island the explorer may lose food  and 
fuel  if the natives are hostile and may receive food if food  is 
available.  As one revisits islands that are hostile, the odds of 
being  met with hostility is reduced and the chances  of  finding 
food  on an island originally without food increase.  These  odds 
are shown in the window that appears at every such landing.  Note
that even if an island is marked as hostile, that hostility  only
causes harm if you are in your craft at the shore for any  period
of time.  You can quickly disembark by shutting down  the  engine
and pressing the I key.  You can then move to a  building,  enter
it and explore and then return to your craft without problems but
once back in your craft, you had best shove off from the shore as
quickly as possible.  There is, admittedly, a degree  if  illogic
to this but it plays well.

Any   landing   at  a  pier  always  provides   repair   of   any 
instrumentation  damaged  by pirate boardings.  Note  that  piers 
represent  settlements  and  that the rest of an  island  may  be 
hostile  or unfriendly to an explorer.  Hence when landing  at  a 
pier,  the window reflects the nature of the rest of the  island.  
Thus, you may be able to buy fuel and food at a pier and still be 
advised by the window that chances of food are 0%.  When  landing 
at  a pier the boat is brought to a stop and returned to  neutral 
automatically.

All  landings provide you statistics about previous  landings  at 
the  island  and give you the chance to cache or  retrieve  money 
from  the  island.  At this time you also learn if there  is  any 
treasure  on the island which will appear as cached  money  along 
with the word TREASURE.  The cache function can be called up when 
landed at a island by entering the key C.

All landings at piers also give you a trade menu to buy or  sell.  
This  functionality  can be recalled by entering the key  T  when 
landed at a pier.

Once  you have landed at an island, either at it's shore or at  a 
pier, you can get off of the boat with the I-key but only if your 
health is not less than 50.  On an island there may be a building 
(square  shape)  or a village/ruin (odd shape).   By  moving  the 
cross hairs which appear when you disembark to the red dot at the 
lower  right  corner of the shape, you either get  an  experience 
message or get entered to the building.	  The size  of  the  move
is greater with the Shift key held down.         NOTE:  It may be 
necessary to use the shifted arrow key to jump over your craft if
the cross hairs are placed at  the end  of the  pier or  you will
keep returning to your craft.


Page 5

Experience message may result in you receiving some money from  a 
benefactor.  They will also provide important information.  There 
can  be  multiple  experience messages as a given  island  but  a 
number  of days (2-7) must pass before you can get the  following 
one(s).  You will be advised when there are no more messages at a 
given island.

The  buildings  were left by an ancient race that came  and  left 
this  world before your adventure started.  They contain  robotic 
beings  that  will approach and drain your health.  Once  in  the 
building the keypad arrows move you about.  The 5-key will  shoot 
in the direction you are facing destroying either blocks that are 
in your way or a robot.  The robots face in directions too.  They 
are represented as black arrows. If one is facing you, he can see 
you.   You  are  a green arrow and can only  see  robots  in  the 
direction  you are facing.  Thus, you should look behind you  now 
and again to insure no robot sneaks up behind you.

In  each building will be a box.  It will appear as a  green  box 
when  you come into sight of it.  Move over it to pick it up.  In 
some instances you will be asked to enter a code word to pick  it 
up.  During your adventures you will learn what to enter.   Until 
that time you can just enter the Enter key by itself to be backed 
off of the box.  Once you have a box, exit the building by moving 
back  to the lower right corner of the maze and moving  out  from 
the  building.   Take the box back to your craft.   Its  contents 
will then be revealed.  It may contain one of the Sun Spheres you 
are looking for.

Watch out for trap doors.  If you move too fast you may hit  one.  
If  you move slowly, it will appear as a red block when  you  are 
next to it.  You do not want to move over it.

                    INSTALLATION AND START UP

This adventure requires CGA graphic capability and 320 RAM.   Any 
resident  utilities should  be  removed  to  insure  the  proper 
function of this adventure.

The CONFIG.SYS file must assign FILES=20 and it is suggested that 
you  set  BUFFERS=10.  See your DOS manual for  instructions  for 
setting up a configuration file.   A sample CONFIG.SYS file comes
on Disk 1 and can be copied to the root directory of your hard
disk if you do not have one.

The  disk(s)  are not protected and backups should be  made  with 
DISKCOPY.  

*** SEE OPTIONS SCREEN FOR ADJUSTING SPEED FOR YOUR COMPUTER ***

Floppy System [No installation required].........................

Insert  Disk 1 into desired drive.  
Make that drive  current  :  >A:       [for drive A]
Change to subdirectory EX1:  >CD EX1 
Start the adventure       :  >EX1
			     >EX1 S  [for a silent start-up]

When told, remove the Disk 1 and insert Disk 2.   (For single 3.5
inch diskette distribution, no switching of disks is  necessary.)
Leave the disk in the drive until completely exiting the adventure.
The disks must not  be  write protected.

Hard Disk System.................................................

Installation:

Create a subdirectory on your hard disk:  >MD EX1
Make it the current directory          :  >CD \EX1
Insert Disk 1 in the drive of your choice.
Enter at the DOS prompt,

a:INSTALL a x 

substitue for 'a' the letter of your floppy drive and substitue for
'x' the letter of the hard drive you are copying to.   Repeat  this 
with Disk 2 if you have  a  two  disk distribution.

Note that some distributions have a SCRNS.COM  file that  contains
some EGA scenes  of The Dezerian Assignment,  another  adventure I 
have finished some  months  ago.   This new adventure requires EGA
graphics capability.    I  have  included  some  scenes  from that
adventure which you can see if you have  EGA graphics.   SCRNS.COM
is a 'self-extracting' file you can copy  to  another floppy or to
a hard disk.  When you run it, it will 'pop'  open  to a number of
files.  Run SCENES at the DOS prompt to see the screens.

Running:

Change to proper subdirectory:  >CD EX1  [for hard disk subdir EX1] 
Start the adventure          :  >EX1
			        >EX1 S  (for a silent start-up)
Always exit the game before turning off the computer.

First  Expedition gives you three types of adventures to  pursue.  
These three are described below.

1.
This option starts a 'normal' expedition. 
Within a normal  expedition, it  may become necessary to call for 
a rescue.  This is all explained later in this document.

2.  3.
These options start you off on a rescue mission.  Option 2 places 
the  lost  craft  somewhere  in the  upper  left  or  lower  left 
quadrant  of the world. You are told which quadrant but  not  the 
coordinates  of the lost craft.  It is for you to  search  within 
the  proper  quadrant using the tools available  and  within  the 
allotted  time.  Option 3 is the same except that the lost  craft 
is  placed in one of the right two quadrants making it closer  to 
Holm  Island.   These  adventure  options  give  the  explorer  a 
specific mission; to find a lost craft.

Note  that  until you has earned a class-3  vessel  by  obtaining 
enough money and buying one, First Expedition does not offer  you 
a  selection.  Once you have operated under  'normal'  expedition 
mode and have made sufficient funds to purchase a class-3 vessel, 
the three options will be available after the next initialization 
and will always be available from that point on.

Upon  starting the game initially, there should be a top view  of 
Holm Island, the starting port of your explorer craft.  Note  the 
red dot of the boat docked at the pier.  Some islands have piers, 
others  don't.   At  this  point  you  have  no  food,  fuel   or 
ammunition.  You do have some cash to get started.  The amount is 
shown  at the bottom right of the instrument panel.  You need  to 
use the Trade function (T-key) to buy what you need before taking 
off.

Along  the  bottom is shown the instrument panel.   In  a  second 
we'll  take a look at the instrument panel but first, a few  more 
words  about start up.  In particular, how to exit from once  you 
have finished your session.

To  exit First Expedition, hit the S-key to save or  exit.   This 
key  provides two options; continue or exit.  Exit  automatically 
saves your current position.

Following  the  name  of  each instrument  are  listed  the  keys 
affecting it if there are any.

Engine:  E
The engine light indicates when the engine is running.  Hit the E 
key and watch it go on and off.  Gear must be in neutral to start 
the engine.  Fuel is consumed when this light is on.

Gears:  F5 F7 F9
Forward,  neutral  and reverse.  Must be in gear  before  moving.  
Light  shows what gear you are in.  Must go through neutral  when 
going from one gear to another.  Try it.

Anchor:  A
Anchor is up (up blue arrow), down (down blue arrow) or down  and 
touching  bottom  (down  red arrow). To move,  anchor  cannot  be 
touching bottom.

Compass / Heading:
Both an analog dial and a digital readout provide data on heading 
of  boat.  This shows the direction the boat is aiming.   Heading 
is  based on a 360 degree circle. 0 is north, 90 is east, 180  is 
south and 270 is west.  The left and right arrow keys change  the 
rudder position thus changing the boat's heading.  (See Rudder)

Food:
This instrument shows the number of days of food remaining.   The 
capacity  is  determined by the class of the boat.  If  it  falls 
below -3, you are a goner!   That's  three  days  without  food.  
We've got to draw the line somewhere.

Class:
This indicator shows current classification of the boat, class 1, 
2, 3 or R for rescue.  More on this later.

Knots:  Up-arrow  Down-arrow
The current speed of the craft is shown here.  Up and down  arrow 
keys accelerate and decelerate the craft.  These keys are  toggle 
type  keys.   For  example, hitting  the  accelerate  key  starts 
acceleration.  Hit it again and the speed stops increasing.  Play 
with them while at sea and you'll get the hang of it.  Make  sure 
you  are  pointed  in the right direction.  Engine  must  be  on, 
anchor  not touching bottom and gear in forward or  reverse.   (4 
knots maximum in reverse).

Rudder:  [Shift] Right-arrow   [Shift] Left-arrow   5-key
The rudder has seven  positions to left and right. The  left  and 
right arrow keys alter the rudder setting.  The 5-key centers the 
rudder.  Your craft has the very useful  characteristic of  being 
able to turn while standing still. The engine must be on to turn.
Shift-arrow-key is a quick way to set full rudder to left or right.

Page 9

A red pointer on the instrument  panel  shows  the setting of the
rudder.  Full rudder should be used for making  a  turn.  As  you
would expect, the slower you are moving, the sharper the turn you
can make.  Partial rudder  settings  are  useful  for  offsetting
currents  that  are slowly pulling your craft off course.   There
are  different currents and you are told  the current's direction
and strength each day.

Ammo:
This  shows  the count of cannon ammunition remaining.   More  on 
this under the function 'Cannon'.

Fuel:
This shows the amount of fuel left.  A red indicator light  shows 
when less than 1/4 of a tank is remaining.  The faster the  craft 
is moving, the faster the fuel is consumed.

Day:
This  shows  the  number of days  into  the  current  expedition.  
During  a rescue mission, a red number shows the number  of  days 
left to return to Holm Island.

Survey Rockets: F1 VF
This  portion of the instrumentation shows the number of  rockets 
remaining for radar scanning purposes. 

Messages: +
Messages  will appear across the bottom of the  instrument  panel 
when  there  is information for you or when your second  mate  is 
talking to you.  Each message or statement scrolls across and  is 
announced by a series of three rising tones.  

At  the coming of evening, a message will advise of the  strength 
and  direction of the sea current.  The direction is the  degrees 
from  which the current is coming.  The degrees are the  same  as 
those  on your plastic compass, 0 to 360.  Remember that you  are 
given  the  direction the current is coming  from,  not  heading.  
This information will be useful is helping you set the rudder  to 
compensate.

If  the  instrument panel is not being displayed when  a  message 
comes  (maybe you are using the aft or nightsky view), the  tones 
will  advise  that  a  message has come  through.   Call  up  the 
instrument view (F6) and recall the last message by entering  the 
+ key on the keypad.  This will recall past messages.

Striking  the  space  bar will halt the display  of  the  current 
message being scrolled across the screen which is useful as there 
will  be some messages you will get to recognize and not want  to 
wait for the message to complete its scrolling.

Money:
This number shows the amount of money you have.


Page 10

Health:
This value (0-100) shows your state of health.  If it falls below 
50,  you can not disembark onto any island.  You need to  call  a 
doctor while at a pier and pay his fee to get well.  0 level does 
not mean you are dead.... just in pretty bad shape.

Page 11

                            FUNCTIONS

So  much for the instrumentation.  This might be a good  time  to 
take your craft out for a short spin.  Keep in mind that  nothing 
you  do will ever result in a quick and terrible death but a  few 
more comments might be appropriate.  

Before  leaving Holm Island you need to spend some of your  money 
for fuel and food.  You may want some ammunition too if you  plan 
to stray very far from the island.  The key T gets you into trade 
mode.

As you leave the island the scene will automatically revert to an 
instrument  view.   Remember  that the instrument  view  gives  a 
forward horizon perspective.  Select the stern view (F10) and see 
Holm  Island as a profile receding behind you.  Play  the  rudder 
and watch the compass and heading alter.  You might want to  head 
out at a fixed angle (such as 90 degrees - East) so that even  if 
the island goes out of view you can turn around and head back  at 
270 degrees to return to the island. 

Note the occasional bird.  This is a sure sign that you are  near 
to  an island.  As you head back to Holm Island it will  reappear 
over  the horizon.  As you venture out on open seas the sight  of 
the  birds and ultimately the peak of an island over the  horizon 
will  come to be a grateful sight with hopes that food  and  fuel 
will be available.

As  you once again approach Holm Island a low-key sound  will  be 
heard.  This indicates the immediate presence of the island which 
is especially useful at night when the skies are black except for 
the myriad stars passing over head.  Again, the scene reverts  to 
a top-view as the boat approaches the island.  You want to  guide 
your craft back into harbor and up to the pier.  NOTE: Landing on 
the shore of an island or at a pier at a speed of greater than  5 
knots  will  cause the loss of a day.  You lose one  day's  food.  
This can be critical if you are landing on an island with no food 
or  if  you  are in rescue mode (more on rescue  later)  and  are 
operating within a specific time limit.

NOTE:   The  only  way your expedition is terminated  is  if  you 
exceed you food count by more than 3 days or if, in rescue  mode, 
you  take too long to rescue and return to Holm Island.   If  the 
food  counter  gets  to -3, termination will occur  at  the  next 
morning  if you are unable to find an island with food  or  shoot 
one  of the large sea creatures of this world.  See the  function 
Radio/Rescue for yet some further functions of First Expedition.


                          Options - ESC

The  option  screen can be displayed by hitting  the  escape  key 
(ESC).  The option screen allows you to tune First Expedition  to 

Page 12

your own desires and level of expertise.  There are four  options 
which are discussed below.  The space bar toggles the  selections 
within  an  option  box.  The return key moves you  to  the  next 
option box.  The currently selected box is bordered by red.   The 
option within the box which is selected is in red.  Once set, the 
option settings are saved when exiting (other than sound which is 
always ON at startup).  The option  screen fuctions as a good way
to Pause the adventure also.   Hit ESC whenever you want to  take
a break and  not exit  the game  then exit  the option  screen to
resume play.

The  first option is AUTOPLOT.  If this option is  selected,  the 
navigation  procedure is simplified and does not require the  use 
of the compass which is included with First Expedition.  If  this 
option  is  set of OFF, a more realistic and  manual  method  for 
navigating  is used.  Both navigational procedures are  explained 
under the function Night Sky.

The  second  option determines the accuracy needed  to  hit  both 
pirates  and sea beasts with the cannon.  The beginner  level  is 
the  easiest.  As you become more proficient, you can  raise  the 
level of marksmanship to give yourself a greater challenge.   The 
level you use determines the amount of money received for sinking 
a pirate.  The higher the level, the more money.

The third option toggles sound on and off.  Sound is alway on  at
each startup of the game. Sound is important as it gives warnings
and other information that is needed for successful play. To skip
the opening music, enter EX1 S to start the game.  The sound flag
is still set to on but the entry music is skipped. 

The  fourth  option allows you to adjust the game speed  to  your 
computer.  The setting goes from 0 to 400.  0 yields the  fastest 
setting (for XT type machines) and AT class machines may run best 
at  150 to 250 depending on their clock speed.  One complete  day
cycle (from  morning to morning) is intended to take about  eight 
minutes real time.

                           Trading - T

The  Trade function is activated by the T key.  When the boat  is 
at  an  island  pier, the T key  activates  the  trade  function.  
Otherwise,  it  activates  the  tracking  function.   The   trade 
function  permits you to buy and sell fuel, food, ammunition  and 
even  your boat, moving up to a higher class craft.  You can  not 
sell you boat to move down.  Fuel is bought and sold in 10 gallon 
increments.  The up and down arrow keys are used to buy and sell.

                            Cache - C

When  you land at a pier or island you are advised of the  status 
of the island and given a chance to store some money or  retrieve 
money  you have left there earlier.  You can on cache money,  not 
supplies.  This is important since if you are boarded by pirates, 
they  take  a  fraction of the money you  have  with  you.   This 
function  can be reentered while still landed by entering  the  C 
key.  A rescue boat can not cache, only retrieve.

                            Cannon - F8 I J K L M


Each  class of craft is able to carry a number of rounds for  the 
cannon.  This capability permits one to shoot both sea beasts for 
food and pirates that might be coming at you to board and relieve 
you of some fuel and a day's food. The cannon is operational only 
when  the  craft is at open sea (not close to any  island).   The 
function key F8 activates the cannon cross hairs.  The keys J and 
L  move  the cross hairs left and right with the key K  firing  a 
shot.  Holding down the shift key moves the cross hairs in larger 
increments.   The keys I and M move the cross hairs up and  down.  
The  higher the cross hairs, the further one shoots.   Every  now 
and  then  a sea creature will appear.  If the  creature  is  not 
visible forward, select the stern view.  At first only the tip of 
the  creature will be visible.  If food is needed or one  is  out 
for  sport,  the creature can be approached and fired  upon.   Be 
sure to approach close before firing.  Remember that if red  dots 
appear  in the water as you fire, you are not close  enough.   If 
there are no red dots and you are still not hitting your  target, 
lower the cross hairs as you are firing over your target.   Every 
shot will not necessarily score a kill.  Successfully firing upon 
a  beast  results in gaining three days of  food.   These  beasts 
become  much  more  important  when you  are  out  exploring  the 
uncharted  parts of this world but remember that chasing a  beast 
around for half a day may take you off course enough to require a 
night  sky  scan and replotting of your position  to  reestablish 
your heading.

In  the case of the pirates, one must fire upon an oncoming  ship 
successfully  several  times to sink it.  Keep in mind  that  the 
higher one aims, the farther the cannon will fire.  If firing too 
short, a red mark will appear in the water to so indicate. If the 
red  dot  does  not align with the crosshairs,  some  pirate  has 
knocked  the  sights throwing them off of  alignment.   You  must 
compensate  for  their misalignment until you land at a  dock  at 
which  time  they  are  automatically  reset.   The  more  pirate 
boardings, the greater the misalignment can become. The cannon is 
available on the explorer type vessel, both fore and aft.

                          Night Sky - N

This feature provides the key to navigating across the expanse of 
this world.  When night is upon the land you can select the night 
sky view by hitting key N.  This can be selected while at sea  or 
anchored  hear  an island and in top view.  Note that if  in  top 
view  the boat must be anchored (red down arrow for  anchor)  for 
the  N-key  to function.  While in the night  sky  function,  all 
other  key  functions are inactive until you exit  the  function.  
The Return key exists you from the night sky screen

The  night  sky appears on the screen showing  the  star  pattern 
immediately  above  the  craft.  If moving at  sea  this  pattern 
slowly  moves  based on the craft's heading and  speed.   If  the 
night  sky is being shown on the screen and either day  comes  or 
the  craft approaches close enough to an island to  activate  the 

Page 14

top view, the screen will automatically switch as necessary.

How  to  navigate?!  Using the Sky Chart which shows  the  entire 
star  field over the world, match the patterns on the  screen  to 
the stars on the chart.  The distinct constellations should  make 
this  a  fairly easy task along with having an estimate  of  your 
current  position.   Find  a star on the screen  that  matches  a 
numbered  star on the chart.  Move the cross hairs to  center  on 
the star.  To move cross hairs, use keypad arrow keys as well  as 
the  7,9,1 and 3 keys for diagonal movement.  Holding  the  shift 
key down at the same time moves the cross hairs in larger  steps.  
For  the  most  accurate readings and plotting,  stop  the  craft 
before  going  to night sky and taking your  readings.   This  is 
especially  important if you feel you are close to an island  and 
need to establish one last heading. With the desired star  within 
the  cross  hairs, hit the keypad 5-key.  This will result  in  a 
degree value being displayed.  This is how many degrees the craft 
is  from  the  star.  Jot down the degrees and  repeat  this  for 
another  star on the screen.  You are through with the night  sky 
now and can use the chart to plot your current position.  To exit 
the night sky function, enter the Return key.

Take  the Island Chart.  The Star Catalogue gives the  longitudes 
and  latitudes of the numbered stars you just scanned.  Find  the 
coordinates on the Island Chart for one of the stars.  Center the 
compass  on that point and rotate the arm to the  degrees  copied 
from  the  screen.   Your craft in  somewhere  along  this  line.  
Repeat this procedure with the second star and plot another line.  
Where the two lines cross is where you are on the world.

After a couple of such plottings, the procedure will prove to  be 
quite  simple.  Such readings are strongly suggested  whenever  a 
new  island is found.  Dock or land, anchor and wait  for  night.  
Plot your newly found island on the Island Chart.

AUTOPLOT is an alternative means of plotting your position.  This 
option  can be turned on via the option screen (ESC  key).   With 
AUTOPLOT  turned on, the procedure for plotting your position  is 
simplified and does not require the use of the compass. 

Using  AUTOPLOT,  you center the cross hairs on a  star  that  is 
numbered  on  the Star Chart and hit the 5 key to  register  your 
selection.   Your  are prompted for the star's  latitude  at  the 
right of the screen.  From the Star Catalogue enter the longitude 
and  hit  the Return key.  You are then prompted for  the  star's 
longitude.   Enter it from the Star Catalogue and hit the  Return 
key.   A  mistake results in a low pitched  tone.   A  successful 
entry  results  in  high pitched tones.  A second  star  must  be 
selected  and  entered  as was the first  star.   Once  you  have 
correctly  entered two stars in this way, your craft's  longitude 
and latitude are displayed at the right of the screen.  Note them 
before hitting return to exit the Night Sky function.


Page 15

Note  that  fog  conditions can make birds  and  island  profiles 
invisible and at night, block the stars.

                       Radar Scanning - F1

You  can  send  a  missile aloft to take  a  radar  scan  of  the 
surrounding area.  The scan covers an area approximately 2000  by 
2000 units.  The launching of the missile is accomplished by  the 
function  key  F1.  Note that a limited number  of  missiles  are 
onboard.   Note also the important point that though  fuel,  food 
and cannon ammunition is available by docking at any island  with 
a  pier,  only  Holm Island is able to  replenish  the  missiles.  
These are automatically resupplied when you return to Holm Island 
at no cost.  Note also that the rescue ship is not provided  with 
radar missles; they are for explorer craft only.

Once  a  missile has been sent aloft, the V key  will  produce  a 
display  showing a full 2000 by 2000 unit area about  the  craft.  
The  position of the explorer craft is at the very center of  the 
display  where the solid axes cross.  Islands are shown as  green 
dots.  The data is displayed in a standard north upward and  east 
to the right configuration regardless of the direction the  craft 
is  facing.   This data is stored and can be redisplayed  at  any 
time  though  would shortly become obsolete as  the  craft  moves 
across  the  world.  Thus the explorer can always  see  the  most 
recent  scan that was taken.  Note that saving the game  (S  key) 
does not preserve the most recent scan.

While  the radar scan data is being displayed, the  adventure  is 
halted.  Hitting any key exits from the radar display screen.

                       Radio / Rescue - R

The  radio function is selected by the R key.  Use the  radio  to 
report  your current coordinates whenever you use  the  stars  to 
calculate  where  you  are.  If you should  ever  get  into  that 
unfortunate  position where the food has run low and there  seems 
to be no choice but to expire, this same function can be used  to 
call for a rescue.  One wants to do so only as a last resort.

The  rescue capability of First Expedition provides an  adventure 
within  an adventure.  A lost craft exists somewhere out  on  the 
surface  of  this  world.  The rescue craft  is  docked  at  Holm 
Island.   As  skipper of this craft you are provided  the  latest 
reported  coordinates  of the lost craft and are  given  a  fixed 
number  of days to find the lost crew and return to Holm  Island.  
If  you  fail to do so, First Expedition  terminates  the  rescue 
mission.  While in rescue mode you have a class-R boat.

When you have come to within 600 units distance of the lost craft 
an  audible  beacon will be heard.  The tone of the  beacon  gets 
higher as you get closer to the lost craft and lowers if you  are 
getting further. If at open sea the lost boat will eventually  be 

Page 16

seen  and should be approached until the screen advises that  the 
lost  crew has been transferred to the rescue craft.  If  in  top 
view,  the lost boat will appear as a green dot if  visible  from 
the rescue craft.  If in a cove or behind the island it will  not 
be visible until the rescue craft is brought into line of  sight.  
Approaching  the  lost craft will result in the transfer  of  the 
lost  crew  to the rescue craft.  Now you must get back  to  Holm 
Island.   Note  that one day of food is lost at both  sunset  AND 
sunrise  rather  than just once a day at sunrise  once  you  have 
picked  up  the  lost crew.  More people  eating  now  you  know!  
Knowing  what islands to land on and the use of your  cannon  can 
become quite important at this point.

A  rescue  craft is not an exploration craft.  You  may  find  an 
uncharted island bu not award is given.  You can not cache  money 
but can retrieve money left there by the lost explorer.  A rescue 
craft  can  not  find treasure either.  Hence,  any  new  islands 
landed  on  by  the  rescue  craft  should  be  revisited  by  an 
exploration craft later.

                          Playback - P

Full-screen  experience messages appear when you land at  islands 
and  go  into villages or visit ruins.  These  screens  give  you 
important  information  to further your quest and may  result  in 
your  receiving  contributions of money.  These screens  are  all 
numbered and any screen that has been seen can be recalled  using 
this feature in case you need to reread one of them.

                           Doctor - D

While  at  a pier, entering the D-key will call up a  doctor  who 
will return your health to 100 if you have sufficient funds.   No 
partial healing is permitted if you don't have enough money for a 
full cure.

                            Flag - F

As you meet sailing craft on the open sea, you need to  determine 
if  they are friendly or hostile.  Friendly craft may  board  you 
and  give  you  supplies if you are low.  Or  they  may  ask  for 
assistance if they need help.  If you refuse you could be  making 
an  enemy.   Friendly craft fly flags.  You can check  out  if  a 
craft is flying a flag by entering the F-key as a sailing  vessel 
approaches.  The problem is, if they are not close enough you may 
not see the flag at first.  You might want to call up the  cannon 
sights, aim and then use the F-key to keep looking for a flag  as 
long as you are willing to hold fire.  A low tone is given for no
flag, a high tone when there is a flag.

                    Landing At An Island - I

When  at a pier or at the shore of an island, you  can  disembark 
and move about the island by pressing I.  If your health is below 

Page 17

fifty,  you  can not get off your boat.  Once on an  island,  the 
keypad  arrow  keys  will move you about.  Doing  so  is  useless 
unless there is a building (square shape) or a village/ruin  (odd 
shape) to visit.  Further details have been given earlier in this 
document.

                       Save / Restore - S

First  Expedition provides a true escape into a world that  holds 
new sights and some surprises that may be just over any  horizon.  
It is meant to provide an ongoing  adventure and towards this end 
each session of exploring is saved by use of the S key. 

Upon  entering First Expedition, if a previous session  has  been 
saved, the user can select to continue the adventure or to  start 
over.   Starting over destroys any previously saved progress  and 
initializes data about previous landings at islands.  One returns 
to a class-1 craft.

Continuing  a saved game restores pertinent data about  the  last 
position  and condition of the craft. Upon restoring,  the  craft 
will  be  stationary,  facing north with the engine  off  and  in 
neutral.  It is up to you to start up the engine and head off  in 
the desired direction.

                 Quicken / Reset Pace of Game - Q

The options screen  (ESC)  permits  you to set the timer value to 
slow this game for the speed of your computer. The Q key alternates
between setting the speed parameter  to  0 then back to the value 
you have set with the options screen.  On faster  machines,  this 
permits one to speed up the action for a brief period. On occasion 
this can be helpful but use this key discreetly for it  speeds up 
fuel  consumption,  etc.  At  the  first  sign of a ship or beast 
approaching, set the game speed back to the proper one  for  your 
machine  by  pressing  Q  again or you will never be able to deal 
with the ship or beast.  The clock rim turns red when you are  in
a quickened mode.

See Environment for more on when to use this capability.

                        Medical Kits - M

Medical kits permit you to raise your health level to 70.   They
are useful when you are not able to get a doctor  such  as  when 
far into Menace territory.   A number  are  available  about the
world at no cost... you just have to find them. The H key brings
up the help screen which tells you how many you have.   Each kit
can be used for only one recouperation.  They are important when
you want  to  get  off  of your craft but your health has fallen 
below 50.

Page 18

                           ENVIRONMENT

Finally,  a few more items to explain the nature of the world  in 
which you are exploring.  

Some islands will be hostile.  This means that if you land on the 
shore,  some food and fuel will be periodically lost.   That  is, 
once  an  island is found to be hostile, you had better  get  off 
shore  as fast as possible.  The irony is that such  islands  can 
also  provide you with food.   When  food  is  available  from an 
island, it is provided immediately upon landing.  If  the  island
is  hostile and you stick around you will begin  to lose food and 
fuel.  Remember that you can get off of your  craft  quickly  and  
visit a building at a hostile island as long as you cast  off  as
quickly as possible once back at your craft.

Some islands have no food available.  This means that landing  at 
the  shore  will provide you with no free food.  There may  be  a 
pier on the same island where you can buy food if you have money.

NOTE:   Islands  that are hostile will become less  hostile  with 
repeated visits.  Also, as days pass after an initial landing  at 
an  island  with  no food available,  food  will  start  becoming 
available.   Each  time you land at any island  other  than  Holm 
Island,  a window provides data about the island.  It  gives  the 
day count of the first time you landed at the island, the  number 
of  visits  made  and  the status of  food  and  natives.   These 
statuses  are be given as the percent chance of finding  food  or 
being met by hostile natives.  The percents change as you revisit 
islands, the chance of finding food increasing and the  hostility 
of the natives decreasing.

Fog  can  occur  at any time, day or night,  and  will  last  for 
varying lengths of time.  Some parts of the world tend to be more 
foggy  than others.  Fog will turn the day sky to white.  If  you 
are approaching an island, the birds won't be visible and  either 
will  the  island  profile when it  would  normally  come  within 
visible  range.  If you happen to come close enough to an  island 
for  a top view, the top view will take place regardless  of  the 
fog.   To  assist in fog and darkness, a sound is heard when  you
are getting near to an island.  It is the waves on the shore  and
the pitch of the sound rises as you get closer to the island.  If
the pitch begin getting lower, you know you have passed the island
and need to change course.

As  you get away from an island and into open sea you can  expect 
to see pirates now and then.  Their mast may suddenly appear over 
the  horizon.  This is a good sign that you had best change  your 
course  or prepare to do battle with your cannon.  They can  also 
come  up  from behind you so you had better glance at  the  stern 
view  now and then. If you're lucky, your second mate  will  warn 
you.   These  rascals will head towards you  with  intentions  of 
gaining  some  loot.  If they are able to approach  close  enough 
they will board you and help themselves to some food and fuel and 
in  a  random  manner proceed to bust things  up.  Being  boarded 
results  in  the  loss of some of your cash  on  hand.   If  some 

Page 19

function  fails to work after such a boarding....well,  you  know 
who to blame.  Try to make it to an island with a pier to land at 
for  repairs.  On the other hand, sinking pirates earns money  so 
if  you  are well armed, you may be glad to see them.  The higher
your level of marksmanship on the option screen, the greater  the
money rewarded for sinking a ship.  Be  aware they come in groups
sometimes.  Once warned of  their  presence, keep  a watchful eye
even after sinking one. Note again that not all craft are pirates.
Better check with the flag function until you are sure or you may
be sinking a friend. You may need them later to get food and fuel
if you are stranded at sea.  Whenever I am expecting a ship to be
approaching, I stop my craft  so  as  to  reduce the speed of our
coming together if they are headed at me.

Storms  can occur at any time.  Sometimes there will  be  warning 
signs  that may give you time to find refuge at an island if  you 
happen  to be near one.  Storms have no effect on you if you  are 
in top view distance of an island.  Storms will only rage briefly 
during which you have no keyboard control. The effects of a storm
are to shift your position randomly. The  degree  of the shift is
determined by the severity  of  the  storm.   You  will  need  to 
redetermine  your position by the stars after being caught  in  a 
storm.   If the storm is particularly bad, you can lose  food  or 
fuel.  There are places on the  world  where your compass can  go
crazy, where you are forced off of you desired course  and  where
your craft can not move through the water at its full speed.  One
interesting island that is not even visible to  scanning  rockets
is surrounded by such area that must be fought against  to  reach
the island.  Sometimes you may have to fight the currents to head
where you want.  If the dots on the water and the  stars  on  the 
horizon keep moving normally, then the problem is  magnetic.   If
they start shifting left or right, then your  craft  is  actually
torn off course and you need to use the rudder  if  you  wish  to
fight it.

Another thought to pass on is that while you are in night sky mode
with the star field on the screen while  you  are  under  way, the
adventure continues operating.  Pirates can come upon you, fog can
suddenly obscure the stars or you may come upon an island.   Since
your First Mate tends to give you warnings and since his  messages
are accompanied with a tone, if you are looking at the  stars  and
plotting when you hear the tones indicating he has said something,
you may want to exit to the instrument view and use the +  key  to
replay any one-liner you may have missed.  Remember that the space
bar will kill the scrolling one  liners  once  you  recognize  the
message.

Also, even if you run out of fuel at sea and you do not want to use
the rescue function, wait for a ship to come along.  Friendly ships
will share their supplies with you if they see you are in need and
you have shared with them on earlier meeting and have not sunk them.
The Q key can help on faster machines to speed things up when you
are forced to await the coming of a ship.  No guarentees here but
it's worth the try.  If you have alienated  a  friendly  ship  by
sinking one of their kind earlier, they will eventually  befriend 
you.  How long it takes depends on how many times you  have  sunk
a friendly ship.   If you run out of fuel while in top, your  are
a goner with no hope other than running a rescue.

FIRST EXPEDITION / TRINITY CONTROLLERS    Copyright 1990  Steve Englestad

First Expedition is a seagoing adventure that is intended to combine
navigation by night stars with a traditional graphics adventure.  It
is NOT a text adventure but a first-person ocean going adventure in
a fantasy world with sea beasts, storms, islands, mazes and the
challenge of finding and exploring new islands as part of solving
the puzzle you are faced with.  Quest for the Trinity Controllers is
an alternate adventure using the same program.

First Expedition comes on two 5.25 floppies or one 3.5.
If two 3.5 disks are distributed, use them the same as the 5.25 floppies.
All files are in the subdirectory EX1 on each disk.

On Disk 1 you find the following files:

README.DOC	This file. Includes registration form and descriptions
		of other material available to you.

REGIS.DOC	A single page registration/order form.

EX1MAN.DOC	The 20 page manual which can be printed using
		the DOS PRINT command.  It contains instructions
		on how to install and operate this adventure.

EX1.EXE		The program for First Expedition.

INSTALL.BAT	The install program which helps to install
		the adventure to a hard disk.  DOS COPY can
		do as well.  See the Manual for further info.

CONFIG.SYS	A version of CONFIG.SYS to be copied to the root
		directory if you do not have one.  It shows how the
		FILES and BUFFERS commands should read.

SCRNS.COM	This compressed file contains scenes of one of the other
		adventures available.  To make any use of this file
		it needs to be copied to hard disk or another floppy.
		You then run SCRNS at the DOS prompt to unpack a number
		of files.  To see the screens, run SCENES.  You must have 
		EGA graphics capability to view these scenes. NOTE: This 
		has nothing to do with First Expedition.  If you have no
		hard disk or EGA graphics ability, ignore this file.

On Disk 2 are the data files supporting First Expedition.  If Disk 2
is for Quest for the Trinity Controllers, the follow-up adventure,
it will contain a brief manual, TRINMAN.DOC, describing installation.

Note that this adventure requires a computer with CGA graphics
capability.  It can be run from a single floppy drive or can
be installed to hard disk.  Running it from a hard disk will be
smoother.  First Expedition operates completely from the keyboard.

The software is complete.  You can run First Expedition as is but
there are charts and other accessories that support the adventure
that can not be placed onto a disk.  These items will be mailed 
to you at no cost beyond the registration and shipping and handling
fee.  The manual (EX1MAN.DOC) contains a full description of these
items.  To help you get a feel for the adventure, you can create 
your own Star Chart and Catalogue on an Epson compatible printer by
running STARS at the DOS prompt after installing the game.

The Quest for the Trinity Controllers:

Once I completed First Expedition, I created a whole new world in
which you can explore using the same craft.  The story is different 
and the islands are all different in shape, location and nature.  
A more advanced island creation routine permitted me to create clusters
of islands.  The story is set in a land of sorcerers and magic.  I call
this adventure The Quest for the Trinity Controllers.  The messages in
Trinity tend to lead you more than in the original First Expedition
which has the background story book for hints and insights.  Trinity
is a new data set to be run with the same program as First Expedition.
You receive a new data set on floppy, a story booklet and a new chart
of the world of the Quest.  You must register First Expedition to
purchase this set.


The Dezerian Assignment:

This is a completely new and different adventure.  It requires EGA
graphics capability and can be run from floppy but hard disk is always
preferrable.  You have some scenes from this EGA desert-world adventure
in the file SCENES.ZIP.  If you have a hard disk and EGA graphics
capability you must 'unzip' this file and run SCENES to actually see
some of the graphics.  Unzipping requires a readily available program
PKUNZIP.EXE often found on bulletin boards and at virtually any
computer store.  

This adventure has 45 various objects to be found and sold or used
to complete your assignment on a desert world with subterranean mazes.
The Dezerian Assignment does not have the 'plot your position' issues
of First Expedition but has more action with spiders and flying 
creatures to contend with.  You do not have to register First
Expedition to order this set.

First Expedition by Steve Englestad.  Version 4.0


First Expedition comes on two floppies.  Because of the 112 file 
limit for root directory on 360 floppy and a follow-up which has
just over that, the floppies  for  First  Expedition each have a 
subdirectory, EX1, in which all the files  are  stored.   Please 
keep this arrangement for distribution.	Feel free to zip each
floppy for BBS if you have such arrangements.


Registration is $23.90 which gets the registrant a full  support
packet of charts, story booklet and protractor for plotting.


Suggested text for catalogue entry:


FIRST  EXPEDITION v4.0  is an extensive  story-telling  adventure 
supported   by  island  charts,  star  charts   for   navigation, 
protractor and story book providing the background to your quest.  
These items along with full support are provided to  registrants.  
Day and night phases with fog, storm, pirates and friendly craft, 
sea  beasts  and islands rising over the horizon.   First  person 
perspective while at sea.  Watch for birds.  Medical kits restore 
health.   Survey  missiles scan area around you.   On  shore  the 
story  unfolds with 'experience' messages.  Search through  mazes 
to  find  ???  but watch out for the  Biobotics.   At  piers  buy 
supplies  and fuel.  You are accompanied on your entire quest  by 
your  First Mate, an old salt who 'talks' to you.   Once  solved, 
provides  random rescue missions for further enjoyment.  A  major 
work  with extensive documentation.  Requires CGA graphics.  Play 
from hard disk or single floppy drive.
