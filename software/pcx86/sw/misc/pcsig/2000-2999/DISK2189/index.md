## Information about "VIDEO TAPE CONTROL"

    Automate the rental and membership operations of your retail video
    store!  VIDEO TAPE CONTROL's many unique features, such as a tape
    library, pop-up windows and the ability to take advantage of your
    computer's maximum processing speed, let you handle movie rentals and
    returns quickly and easily. Keep track of membership, rental revenue,
    film inventory and reservation information vital to your store's
    operation.
    
    Reservations can be made on tapes and items for more than a week in
    advance and you're reminded of the reservations when the tape is
    rented or returned. Late fees are automatically calculated and you're
    alerted when fees are due. Customer receipts are generated with
    each transaction. Included is the opportunity to simplify your
    operations even further by connecting VIDEO TAPE CONTROL to your cash
    register drawer. Accounting data is collected regarding daily,
    monthly and annual rental revenues.
    
    Print reports on member rental activity, revenue by member, film
    reservations, late returns, and tape inventory. Mailing labels for all
    members or specific categories of members may be generated. VIDEO TAPE
    CONTROL's timesaving and efficient transaction processing assists you in
    increasing your store's profitability.
