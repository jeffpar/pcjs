## Information about "TESTWRITER"

    Here's a riddle.  What do teachers love that's easy to crunch and "red"
    all over?  Give up?  It's TESTWRITER!  TESTWRITER takes the hassle out
    of making up tests.  Well, not all the hassle, you still have to write
    the original questions or copy them out of the teacher's manual.  But
    once that is done, you'll never have to type them again.
    
    TESTWRITER is a full fledged word processor which can be used for
    preparing a file containing examination questions and for almost any
    other task that word processors can handle.  Its fast, easy-to-use, and
    may just take the sting out of test writing.  TESTWRITER offers a
    command structure very similar to WordStar as well as pull-down menus,
    function key commands and an "undo" key.
    
    TESTWRITER prints the examination and also prints the corresponding
    answer sheets.  Nobody loves tests, but TESTWRITER makes test writing
    easier to take.
