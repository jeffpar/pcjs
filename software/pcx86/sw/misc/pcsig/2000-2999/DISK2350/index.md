## Information about "IMAGEACCESS"

    IMAGEACCESS -- a database program that associates a graphics image file
    with each text record. The result is a simple database of pictures that
    can be displayed on your monitor and printed on either a dot-matrix or
    laser printer.
    
    IMAGEACCESS accepts image files in .MSP (Microsoft Paint), .PCX (PC
    Paintbrush), or .TIF (Tagged Image File) formats. The image files can
    be created by a hand scanner, a full page scanner, any of several paint
    programs, or a video digitizer.
    
    Whatever the subject matter of the images or photographs, IMAGEACCESS
    will make their organization easier. Access to a specific image is
    only a few keystrokes away. Once entered, the database can be
    searched and images displayed or reports printed which include the data
    and images.
    
    The potential uses of IMAGEACCESS are limitless. IMAGEACCESS can
    create an inventory of just about any collection or group of people,
    places, or things. Clip-art for desktop publishing can easily be
    organized by category, description, and size. Personnel files can
    contain photographs of employees for easy identification and security.
    Collectors, genealogists, historians, writers, archaeologists,
    photographs or images of interest.
