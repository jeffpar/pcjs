## Information about "HOME FINDER"

    A sophisticated database program specifically for Real Estate Agents
    and property consultants, HOME FINDER puts your listings at your
    fingertips.
    
    It sets up three databases: properties for sale, properties for rent,
    and properties currently rented.  Each database can have up to 250
    records (the registered version holds 20,000 records).  Search quickly
    for properties that match a customers requirements in size, number of
    bedrooms, location, type of dwelling, swimming pool, parking, and many
    other criteria.  Add and change criteria to meet your needs.
    
    The program is sophisticated enough to also search for properties that
    almost match a customer's requirements as well.  Searches can also be
    done by address or any keyed word or phrase.  Results are displayed on
    the screen or you can print them . Impress your clients with personal
    reports of the properties they are interested in.  HOME FINDER's
    client report format never prints vital property information that would
    let a customer simply go to the property owner.
    
    HOME FINDER is an easy-to-use program that lets you move easily
    through its series of menus using your cursor keys.  Help screens
    either automatically appear as you move through the operations or can
    be called up whenever you need them.  You can print reports in
    five different formats.
