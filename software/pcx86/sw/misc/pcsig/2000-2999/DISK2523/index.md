Disk Title: The Jorf Interpreter                                        
PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: The JORF Interpreter & Tutorial                          
Author Version: 1.1                                                     
Author Registration: $45.00                                             
Special Requirements: Tutorial requires 512K RAM, and a hard drive.     
                                                                        
If you've been wondering about the world of object oriented programming 
(OOPs), JORF is an OOPs language to get you started.  It includes one   
data type, three key words, and 80 standard library functions.  Although
it uses a simple syntax and very few key words, JORF supports arrays,   
pointers, database storage, expert system rule chaining, bit and        
substring manipulation, recursion, and much more.  JORF uses the all of 
conventions of OOPs languages:  classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and
polymorphism.                                                           
                                                                        
The JORF programming environment includes an interpreter, editor,       
debugger, tutorial, hypertext help, and a class browser.  The help      
screens include a fine explanation of OOPs principles.  This is high-   
level programming and a great way to learn OOPs.
