## Information about "SHAREDEBATE INTERNATIONAL"

    The magazine is a quarterly debate forum for PC users concerned about
    the present & future.  Ben Bova, author & former editor of OMNI &

    forums established in this first issue deal with a National Interest

    Fight the Greenhouse Effect and Strengthen the Economy; Japanese vs U.S.

    International to encourage people to distribute, participate, and profit
