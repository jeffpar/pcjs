PC-SIG Version: S1.01

Special Requirements: 512K RAM (EGA - 256K RAM). Hard drive & mouse reco
                                                                        
Most menu programs are just a list of program names -- BORING!  That was
until the ICON MENU SELECTION PROGRAM.  Now your menus can include      
pictures (icons) to represent program selections, instead of just lines 
of text.  It's also fun.  Use the cursor keys or the mouse to select the
icon/program you want to run, and off you go!                           
                                                                        
Icons are included for generic applications (word processing, kids      
games, etc.) and many specific applications (Lotus 1-2-3, Harvard       
Graphics, etc).  In addition, you can create icons if you're using a    
paint or graphics editor that supports PC-Paintbrush files.  While it   
takes a little more time to set up than other menu programs, the ICON   
MENU SELECTION PROGRAM is a great way to jazz up a computer or make     
it accessible to a child or anyone else who has trouble reading         
text-based menus.                                                       
                                                                        
As an added extra, a disk catalog and label program for both 5.25 and   
3.5 in. disks accompanies the package (currently supporting Epson or    
compatible printers only). The unique features of this program are the  
intuitive user interface ("pop-up" style windows), the ability to enter 
a bin number (for people with more than one disk box), and the ability  
to use more than one database file.  Also, the program allows you to    
print a custom footer on the label such as "Property of: ..." as well as
disk name, catalog number, and bin number.
