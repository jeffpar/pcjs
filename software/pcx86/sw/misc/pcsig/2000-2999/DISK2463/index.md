## Information about "KATIE'S CLOCK AND REMEDIES"

    Teaching children to tell time from an analog (standard old time) clock
    can try the patience of most parents. That was before KATIE'S CLOCK was
    developed.
    
    KATIE'S CLOCK displays a giant analog clock on your computer screen. As
    the dial changes position, you can quiz your child orally or have
    him/her enter the time digitally into the computer. During the testing,
    you can set the dials to move randomly or increment every five minutes.
    You can also test by inputting the time digitally and having the clock
    dials display the proper time. This program is a breeze to use and
    you'll be teaching time -- in no time!
    
    Whether you have a sore throat, colic, cramps, gas, a headache, or a
    hangover, REMEDIES has some down-home ways to make you feel better.
    REMEDIES is not meant to replace a doctor, but it does offer some
    healthy natural advice for many common ailments.  Select a listed
    ailment and REMEDIES recommends herbal cures.  Select a listed herb and
    REMEDIES will tell you what it cures.  Over 60 herbs and 60 ailments
