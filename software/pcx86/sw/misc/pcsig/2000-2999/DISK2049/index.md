## Information about "CHECKBOOK MANAGEMENT DISK 2 OF 2 (393)"

    CHECKBOOK MANAGEMENT is a complete checkbook management system which
    takes the check register one step further while helping you to maintain
    your budget. It's good for personal and small business checking
    accounts.
    
    Record all forms of checking account transactions, including bank
    charges, ATM deposits and withdrawals, and interest. CHECKBOOK
    MANAGEMENT writes checks, but you can also reconcile bank
    statements and get a variety of reports on itemized transactions and
    periodic summaries. You can keep up to 3000 transactions on floppies,
    or an unlimited number if you use a hard disk.
    
    Establish budget categories and assign each transaction item to a
    budget classification. This flexible program lets you change these
    designations as needed. At last, you'll be able to find out just where
    it all goes!
