Author Version: 1.10                                                    
Author Registration: $40.00                                             
Special Requirements: 370K RAM                                          
                                                                        
MEMOS&MORE, THE FILE COMPANION is a user productivity shell which       
provides file management, task documentation, file launching and file   
editing under one easy-to-use interface. It is designed to help get a   
handle on the ever-growing number of files generated by most computer   
users.                                                                  
                                                                        
MEMOS&MORE provides such features as attaching up to 500 lines of user  
defined text for each directory entry, launch files into applications,  
QuickView into another drive/directory, store keystrokes to often used  
applications in up to 26 Hotkeys, edit files with your own editor, and  
find a file anywhere on a drive.                                        
                                                                        
MEMOS&MORE can be used by both experienced and novice PC users. The     
experienced user will appreciate the memo feature to record notes on    
work-in-process and the hotkey to store tedious series' of keystrokes to
run applications or perform other operations. The novice can use the    
memos as mini online manuals to get familiar with the available         
applications. (This can be a great time saver for PC Managers.) Everyone
in between will find that having Help notes right with the files a great
memory jogger while the file launcher brings a file into an application 
in one keystroke.                                                       
                                                                        
MEMOS&MORE is not a DOS shell. It is a productivity shell to help you   
get your job done.  It is designed to be the center of user interaction 
with the PC.  It is a basic tool ready to make PC usage easier for all  
types of users.

                  WELCOME TO JCK ENTERPRISES'S          (VER0790)
                 MEMOS&MORE, THE FILE COMPANION

SAMPLE PROGRAMS =================================================

In most cases, application programs commonly used today allow the
passing of a filename through the command line for automatic
loading.  The following examples are provided as guides for
loading files into programs which do not accept filenames as
command line parameters.  Once the process is defined the
launching of the file from the command line becomes transparent.

         Examples are provided for:

            1) Lotus 1-2-3
            2) DBase III Plus
            3) AutoCad

The techniques presented in the examples are fairly straight
forward and can be modified as required.  In addition, when
MEMOS&MORE, THE FILE COMPANION launches a file it writes the file
name information on the file EXITFILE.&MR in the Memos&More home
directory as text.  It has three lines which offers info on the
launched file name in the following ways:

                 1) Path only;
                 2) Filename & Extension only
                 3) Path, FileName & Extension

This file could be accessed by the application program or by some
other means for processing.

Example 1:  Lotus Spreadsheets ==================================

Lotus 1-2-3 provides a means of taking control upon loading
through the use of the \0 macro found in a spreadsheet.  This is
invoked after the file is loaded.  Lotus 1-2-3 also automatically
loads a default filename(AUTO123.WK1), if it exists.  These
features have been combined in the following batch file.

Note: This example assumes the following:
  o LOTUS 1-2-3 resides on the D:\LOTUS subdirectory
  o the file AUTO123.MAC resides on the D:\LOTUS subdirectory
  o first parameter( %1 ) is the Lotus worksheet you wish to load
  o you are running MS-DOS 3.30 or higher.
  o You also have the Allways Lotus Add-In package

Sample Call from the Command Line:   C:\ >LOTUS work1.wk1

FILE: LOTUS.BAT

@echo off
  .
  .
  .                Fill in your stuff here ....
  .
  .
set prog=123
set oldpath=%path%
set path=d:\lotus;d:\lotus\allways;%path%
: ALLWAYS CHECK ......
if not exist allways.adn  set noall=true
if "%noall%" == "true"  copy d:\lotus\allways.adn allways.adn > nul
: CHECK IF A PARAMETER IS PASSED IN .... ASSUMED A *.WK1 File ...
IF "%1" == "" GOTO :SKIP
    ECHO %1 > 123FIL.TXT
    COPY D:\LOTUS\AUTO123.MAC AUTO123.WK1 > NUL
:SKIP
d:\lotus\%prog%
: CLEANUP ALLWAYS STUFF ...
if "%noall%" == "true"  del allways.adn
: CLEANUP THE PARAMETER STUFF ...
IF "%1" == "" GOTO :SKIP2
    DEL 123FIL.TXT > NUL
    DEL AUTO123.WK1 > NUL
:SKIP2
: CLEAN UP THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ...
set path=%oldpath%
set oldpath=
set noall=
set prog=
  .
  .
  .                Fill in your stuff here ....
  .
  .
:END

The AUTO123.MAC file is a spreadsheet with the following Macro:

      I            J            K            L            M
 1   \0       {WINDOWSOFF}
 2            {OPEN "123FIL.TXT",R}
 3            {READLN J10}
 4            {CLOSE}
 5            {RECALC J7..J7}
 6            /fr{ESC}{ESC}
 7                         { J7 Contains: @TRIM(@S(J10..J10)) }
 8            ~
 9
10                         { J10 Gets the file name to load ... }


EXAMPLE 2: DBASE III Plus Data Base =============================

DBASE III Plus provides a means of loading a .PRG program file
from the command line.  The file DBLOAD.PRG is a short DBase
program which loads the desired database filename.  The file
DBLOAD.DBF is a short database consisting of only one character
field(FNAME) of width 80(Use DBASE to look at the file
DBLOAD.DBF).  The DBLOAD.PRG program uses the DBLOAD.DBF to read
the file DBFIL.TXT(created in the batch file) into the FNAME
field and then uses the database specified in FNAME.

Note: This example assumes the following:
  o DBASE resides on the D:\DBASE subdirectory
  o the DBLOAD.DBF & DBLOAD.PRG files also reside on D:\DBASE
  o first parameter( %1 ) is the DBase III Plus file when the
    second parameter ( %2 ) is specified. Other wise %1 is
    considered a .PRG file
  o you are running MS-DOS 3.30 or higher.

Sample Call from the Command Line:   C:\ >DBASE mydbf.dbf x

FILE: DBASE.BAT

@echo off
  .
  .
  .                Fill in your stuff here ....
  .
  .
d:
cd \dbase
: CHECK IF A SECOND PARAMETER IS PASSED IN .... THEN %1 IS A *.DBF ...
IF "%2" == "" GOTO :PRG
    ECHO %1 > DBFIL.TXT
    SET PRG=DBLOAD
    GOTO :DBASE
:PRG
    SET PRG=%1
:DBASE
d:\dbase\dbase %prg%
: CLEANUP THE PARAMETER STUFF ...
IF "%2" == "" GOTO :SKIPIT
    DEL DBFIL.TXT > NUL
:SKIPIT
cd\
  .
  .
  .                Fill in your stuff here ....
  .
  .
:END

The DBASE III Plus program follows:

FILE: DBLOAD.PRG

set delete on
use C:\DBASE\DBLOAD.DBF
delete all
pack
go top
append from C:\DBASE\DBFIL.TXT type delimited
goto 1
s = Trim(FNAME)
use &s


EXAMPLE 3: AutoCad Drawing Files ================================

AutoCad provides a means to change the default file name at
startup and the capability to start executing a script file from
the command line.  These features have been combined in the
following example.

Note: This example assumes the following:
  o AutoCad resides on the C:\ACAD subdirectory
  o the ACADLD.SCR file also resides on C:\ACAD
  o first parameter( %1 ) is the AutoCad .DWG file you wish to
    load
  o you are running MS-DOS 3.30 or higher.
  o you are using AutoCad version 10.

Sample Call from the Command Line:   C:\ >ACAD mydwg.dwg f

FILE: ACAD.BAT

@echo off
  .
  .
  .                Fill in your stuff here ....
  .
  .
IF "%1" == "" GOTO :NOFILE
    acad %1 acadld.scr
    GOTO :NOFILE
:NOFILE
    acad
:SKIP
  .
  .
  .                Fill in your stuff here ....
  .
  .
:END

The ACADLD.SCR script follows:

FILE: ACADLD.SCR

This text file contains only two (2) lines.  The first one with
only option 2 invoked from the ACAD Main Menu.  The second line
which is blank tells ACAD to use the default filename which was
passed in on the command line .

 line 1: 2
 line 2:
