Disk Title: File Express 4/4 (287, 288, 2555 also)                      
PC-SIG Version: S5

Special Requirements: 512K, 2 drives (1 high density). Hard drive recomm
                                                                        
Expressware has dramatically enhanced product flexibility by rewriting  
FILE EXPRESS in C and Assembler.  Basic relational capability has been  
added to make it easier and more intuitive for the user to retrieve and 
place information in other databases.                                   
                                                                        
Over 100 new features have been added to FILE EXPRESS.  The             
functionality of nearly every aspect of data management -- screen       
definition, import/export, database size, reports, form letters, sorts  
-- has been expanded.  Users can now edit records while in browse mode. 
                                                                        
Recognizing that one of the primary uses of a database is for mailing   
lists, FILE EXPRESS now has word processing capabilities.  Users can    
write a letter from within the program and merge data from a database.
