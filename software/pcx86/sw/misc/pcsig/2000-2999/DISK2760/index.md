Disk No: 2760
Disk Title: Thinking Man's Solitaire 2 of 2 (2759)
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: Thinking Man's Solitaire
Author Version: 1.00
Author Registration: $18.00
Special Requirements: 491K RAM and EGA.

Are you familiar with the standard Solitaire game that builds a stack of
cards from Ace to King?  It's not so hard, especially if you don't have
to stick to one suit.  THINKING MAN'S SOLITAIRE presents a new twist:
the order isn't as simple as Ace, 2, 3.  In fact, you build four
different stacks, each in a different order.  Have trouble remembering
what card comes next?  Ask THINKING MAN'S SOLITAIRE to keep the order
posted on your screen.

The documentation on the disk makes it easy to get started.  Watch the
colorful deck magically shuffle three times, cut, and stack.  Deal the
cards one by one, and see each one move to the stack you designate as
your score mounts.  If you have a mouse, you may use it.  Otherwise, the
keyboard does just fine.  The hardest part of this entertaining game is
stopping.
