## Information about "PC/BILL"

    Here's a time and billing system for those who bill by hourly rates or
    dollar amounts for specific services.
    
    With PC/BILL, all options are selected with a single key; it's
    completely menu-driven. Calculate fees based on either hours billed or
    a flat fee for services. Five different billing formats are
    available, allowing for varying amounts of detail in the bill for
    individual clients. Summary bills for clients with multiple accounts
    are generated automatically. Ageing of accounts receivable and
    calculation of late-charge interest is optional for individual
    clients. Messages can be printed at the end of the bill with
    different messages available for accounts which are delinquent for 30,
    60, 90, or over 90 days.
    
    By using separate files, customized bills can be easily produced.
    Client information can be listed by account number or by client name.
    Each client's account can be checked for accuracy prior to generating
    any bills. If an error is found in a client's account, a bill cannot be
    produced until the error is corrected, an invaluable safeguard. Data
    security is assured by a file backup procedure carried out each month as
    part of the end-of-month procedures.
    
    The package comes with a set of demonstration files that you can use to
    run the system and get acquainted with the billing operation.
