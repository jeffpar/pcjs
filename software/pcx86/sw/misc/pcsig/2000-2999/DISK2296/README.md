## Information about "SUPER GAME PAK"

    SUPER GAME PACK contains six new games for you to explore and enjoy.
    
    In the SHRINE OF KROZ, you are searching for the precious Crown within
    the mysterious kingdom of Kroz.  Undoubtedly, the Crown must be
    guarded by unspeakable dangers.  Armed with a whip and great courage,
    you decide to continue your journey.
    
    WORD WHIZ is a word challenge game to measure your knowledge of the
    English language. For example, are you positive you know what the word
    "peruse" means?  Most people believe it means "to skim" or "to glance
    over," but in fact it means "to read carefully." Most questions focus on
    a key word. There are four multiple choice answers to choose from.
    
    Your quest in the ROGUE RUNNER is to recover the precious Heart of
    Courage, hidden deep inside the treacherous Ezam dungeons. The
    dungeons are populated by the lost souls of those who tried the
    journey before you. You may find maps and pick axes left behind by
    these adventurers. Keep an eye out for the scattered Teleport Scrolls.
    They will help you escape imminent death.
    
    Test your knowledge in the world of Star Trek, one of the most popular
    TV series of all time, with TREK TRIVIA. There are 100 questions to
    pick your brain, each with four possible answers.
    
    ASTEROID RESCUE has you put in command of the Space Eagle. Your
    mission is to rescue the crew members that have been blown from the USS
    Sagan during an uncharted asteroid storm. The crew members from the USS
    Sagan were able to get into their life suits, but their air supply will
    not last long. Help is needed immediately!
    
    BLOCK FIVE is a simple game to learn, yet is quite difficult to
    master. The object is to place five of your Xs in a row while
    preventing the computer opponent from putting five Os in a row.

Our best adventure game requires an entire 360K disk!  Has as many features as
even the best commercial adventure games, and then some.  Like a 16-color
screen, ASCII graphics (that even work on non-graphic systems), 1000+ word
dictionary, over 160 game locations, 400+ sound effects, a "hint"
command, and more.

You begin on a remote mining planet with just your battered space ship and the
hope that one day you'll have a job that actually pays!  After an amazing
discover you begin a trek that spans four planets, including a huge planetship.
All to save a civilization from utter extinction--from a star ready to explode! 

In the Sept-Oct. 1989 issue of Shareware Magazine, Publisher Richard Peterson

╚════════════════════╝
It's a text adventure game that mixes elements of science fiction, action,
fantasy and rollicking adventure.  The story begins with you standing aboard
the Titanic just seconds before the ship sinks!  In this story of riveting 
survival you'll discover a long forgotten undersea mystery, travel to the
Earth's future, fly a shuttle to a floating city and be chased by a slobbering,
three-armed creature--and that's just the believable part!

"...as sophisticated as the best commercial adventure games by Infocom."

"If you've played any of Infocom's famous text games you'll notice that
Beyond the Titanic is quite similar to Zork and Planetfall.  And to add to
the game's realism, sound effects are used throughout."

starts on the sinking Titanic, and through a series of strange and imaginative
occurrences you end up...(not going to give it away!)"

"As a programmer, I'm amazed that this game understands full English sentences.
We've been working--unsuccessfully--on this area for a year now.  Can we buy
your code?"                                       -- Dr. Paul Short, AZ

"After you pick the cabinet's lock, how do I heal my broken arms?  ...also, I
love this game, send me a list of other games you've made."

╚═════════════════════════════╝
T.V. Guide magazine called Star Trek "...the most popular TV series of all
time."  Now we challenge your knowledge of the award winning show with a
series of 10 Star Trek trivia games.  Each volume has 100 multiple choice 
questions, and when you answer a question correctly you'll be rewarded with
a "Bonus Fact".  Bonus Facts are additional tidbits that even further expand
your Star Trek knowledge.

What type of crystal is used to power the engines of the Enterprise?  What
is Mr. Spock's first name?  How fast is warp 2?  What does the Prime 
Directive prevent the crew of the Enterprise from doing?

Did you know that Dr. McCoy's medical instruments were actually modified
salt and pepper shakers.  Or that it was Leonard Nemoy who developed the
idea of Mr. Spock's Vulcan nerve pinch (so as to make Spock less violent).
Or that the Enterprise is 947 feet long.  Or that Joan Collins, Terri Garr,
and Ricardo Montalban all appeared in a Star Trek episode. Or that the
Enterprise was named by Captain James T. Kirks father!

It's all here in Trek Trivia.  You'll also receive a secret code that lets
you answer each question automatically.

"The game moves swiftly and the challenge is great...The 100 true and false
and multiple choice questions are provocative.  [The bonus facts will amaze]
even the most devout Trekker!"                    -- Shareware Magazine

║ SUPER KROZ TRILOGY ║                 $7.50 per volume or $20 for all three
╚════════════════════╝
This is the awaited sequel volumes to the extremely popular Kroz Trilogy.
The Super Kroz trilogy boasts new features galore.  Over forty new playfield
objects (like spells, traps, creatures, treasures, terrains, etc.) have been
added.  The three new Kroz games are:

   RETURN TO KROZ - Your quest for the "Crown of Kroz".
   TEMPLE OF KROZ - A death defying adventure for the "Holy Grail".
   THE FINAL CRUSADE OF KROZ - Will you discover the great mystery of Kroz?

They all have 16-color graphics (yes, 16 colors!) and a tremendous sound
effects library.  In each game you must navigate through dangerous chambers,
solving puzzles and avoiding pitfalls.  Collect gems, whips, chests, nuggets,
tablets, keys and scrolls to aid your progress.  These game are as much
strategic as they are pure arcade fun.

All Kroz games are designed to work correctly on ANY computer system, regardless
of microprocessor type or speed.  Although they are best played on a color
system, they do have an option to be played on a monochrome system!

The following is a review of the new Kroz games from The Software Labs catalog
of shareware games:

"It's pure dynamite!  A unique combination of arcade action, strategy and
adventure unlike any other game you've played.  Some levels are puzzle oriented,
which makes a great change of pace from the high action parts of the game.
You'll find new terrains, traps, spells, hazards, creatures, and levels to
challenge your dexterity, and sound effects galore.  You'll encounter moving
walls, forbidden forests, active volcanoes, bottomless pits and much more,
plus plenty of options.  AND, no two games will be alike!  Great fun, great
challenge, great action--GREAT GAME!!!"

not charging by the hour...or I would be bankrupt!.  I am currently
stationed in Korea, and your games have been the highlight of my tour."

                                                  -- Isabel Goehringer, Germany

The following is an actual letter from a grandmother of the young age of 64:

"I have lived in Kroz for almost a month and was sorry tonight to finally find
the Amulet.

"It really is strange what an illness your game can be.  I have found myself
going over in my head a particularly difficult level right in the middle of a
conversation.  To tell you that I have enjoyed the challenge would be very
understated.

"I am a Grandmother who has traveled around the world, but found no place
that was more interesting than your world of Kroz.

"Please keep my address and drop me a note when you have a new game.  Guess
that about says it all.  Best of everything in the future, I hope that you
become the Agatha Christie of computer games."
                                                  -- Patricia Baker, RI
"P.S. I have died a million deaths!"


"I teach Data Processing at the North Lawrence Area Vocation Technical Center
in Bedford, Indiana.  I am writing because my students found your game Kroz
fascinating.  They are learning to program and would like a listing of Kroz
to dissect and study as a class project."

about them--they might never work on their computer science projects again!

"Unique, exciting arcade-adventure game. Tops!"   -- The Software Labs


╔═════════════════════════════╗
║ THE LOST ADVENTURES OF KROZ ║         (75 new levels!)     $20 registration
╚═════════════════════════════╝

By far the biggest and the best of the Kroz series.  New features include
creature animation, constantly growing forests, gravity wells, ropes, spears,
daily diaries, and many, many more!

If you survive the 75 levels you'll get to read the sacred Tome (book) of
Kroz that explains the untold stories that players have demanded.  Also, for
Rogue players, you'll finally get the Amulet of Yendor!!!


╔═══════════╗
║ WORD WHIZ ║                   $5 per volume or only $14 for all four volumes
╚═══════════╝

A unique and challenging word game.  Test your knowledge of the sometimes
crazy English language.  The English language has more words than any other,
and we rarely use ten percent of them!  Not only that, many words we use
are consistantly used incorrectly.

Example:
  
     If you perused at new book, did you...

     A. Read it carefully and thoroughly, or

     B. Just skim through it

Over 80% of all Americans pick answer B, when in fact the answer is A!

So if you like this kind of challenge, and don't mind the "learning
experience", then you'll love Word Whiz.  (It's also a great education game
for high school and pre-high school students, but while they're having fun,
don't let them know it's good for them, too!)


╔════════════════╗
║ SUPER GAME PAK ║                                                  Only $10

This is a new disk that's been put together to introduce you to Apogee's game
line. All games are fully playable, there's no "demos" or "crippled" versions.

The games are:   ■ Shrine of Kroz -- Same as Return to Kroz
                 ■ Raiders of the Lost Mine -- Avoid the Skull while you dig
                           for gold nuggets
                 ■ Word Whiz -- Volume I of the new word challenge series
                 ■ Rogue Runner -- Kinda' like Pac Man, but a lot different!
                 ■ Trek Trivia -- Volume I for Star Trek fans
                 ■ Asteroid Rescue -- Fly through asteroids as you save
                           astronauts from being crushed
                 ■ Block Five -- Play computer in ancient strategy game

Even if you have one of two of these games already, it is still worth the
low "trial" price to get the other games.  Also, knock five dollars off the
Super Game Pak price if you order $30 or more of any other Apogee games.

In the meantime have fun and good luck.

Sincerely,

Scott Miller
President
