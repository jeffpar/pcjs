## Information about "SUPER GAME PAK"

    SUPER GAME PACK contains six new games for you to explore and enjoy.
    
    In the SHRINE OF KROZ, you are searching for the precious Crown within
    the mysterious kingdom of Kroz.  Undoubtedly, the Crown must be
    guarded by unspeakable dangers.  Armed with a whip and great courage,
    you decide to continue your journey.
    
    WORD WHIZ is a word challenge game to measure your knowledge of the
    English language. For example, are you positive you know what the word
    "peruse" means?  Most people believe it means "to skim" or "to glance
    over," but in fact it means "to read carefully." Most questions focus on
    a key word. There are four multiple choice answers to choose from.
    
    Your quest in the ROGUE RUNNER is to recover the precious Heart of
    Courage, hidden deep inside the treacherous Ezam dungeons. The
    dungeons are populated by the lost souls of those who tried the
    journey before you. You may find maps and pick axes left behind by
    these adventurers. Keep an eye out for the scattered Teleport Scrolls.
    They will help you escape imminent death.
    
    Test your knowledge in the world of Star Trek, one of the most popular
    TV series of all time, with TREK TRIVIA. There are 100 questions to
    pick your brain, each with four possible answers.
    
    ASTEROID RESCUE has you put in command of the Space Eagle. Your
    mission is to rescue the crew members that have been blown from the USS
    Sagan during an uncharted asteroid storm. The crew members from the USS
    Sagan were able to get into their life suits, but their air supply will
    not last long. Help is needed immediately!
    
    BLOCK FIVE is a simple game to learn, yet is quite difficult to
    master. The object is to place five of your Xs in a row while
    preventing the computer opponent from putting five Os in a row.
