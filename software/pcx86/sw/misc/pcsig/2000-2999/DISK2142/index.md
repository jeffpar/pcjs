## Information about "CHOU I"

    If you're a Taoist, a student of the I Ching, or just curious about the
    I Ching and divination, you should have this program! "Chou I: The
    Changes of Chou" is an original translation of the Book of Changes
    (often called "I Ching") of the Chou Dynasty (circa 1100 B.C.). This
    version provides an interpretation of the primordial symbolism of the
    archaic Chinese pictographs which reflect the Taoist and Shamanistic
    roots of the I Ching. The translation included is entirely new, made by
    an internationally recognized scholar.
    
    The program allows one to study the text, perform divinations, and save
    the results (and your comments) to disk for later review. Windowing
    options allow one to view data about the relevant trigrams while viewing
    a hexagram. Also available (in a pop-up window) is a glossary of over
    100 key terms, with descriptions and interpretations of the ancient
    Chinese characters. Complete instructions are provided in the on-screen
    manual.
