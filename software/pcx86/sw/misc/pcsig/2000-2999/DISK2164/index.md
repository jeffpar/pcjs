## Information about "CLASSROOM JEOPARDY"

    Answer: An excellent new teaching aid for your classroom.  Question:
    What is CLASSROOM JEOPARDY?
    
    If you feel your students are getting bored with the same, old
    routine, try this new program from DEC Software.  Important subjects
    such as history, math, and science become classroom fun instead of
    classroom headaches.  Teachers may design their own questions (or
    rather, answers) with the registered version, or use answers provided
    by the program.
    
    Answers will be presented in gigantic letters on the screen and can be
    seen by students up to sixty feet away.  Select your teams (two or three
    are suggested by the programmer) and divide your classroom into
    corresponding groups.  CLASSROOM JEOPARDY will prompt you for a team
    name and then ask you to assign them any key on the keyboard to ring in
    for their responses.  Repeat this process for each team.
    
    Two rounds of CLASSROOM JEOPARDY are played along with a final CLASSROOM
    JEOPARDY answer.  Correct responses can be printed through the DOS print
    command.  Point values range from 100 to 500 for the first round, 200 to
    1,000 for the second round.  Final CLASSROOM JEOPARDY wagers are based
    upon points available and daily doubles are found in each round.  You
    need to keep score manually for each team.  The team with the most
    points is the winner.
    
    Registered users receive the current version of CLASSROOM JEOPARDY, a
    module that allows customizing answers to fit course content and a
    complete user's manual.  An entertaining yet challenging game.

               CLASSROOM JEOPARDY (c) 1988,1989  DEC Computing


       Classroom Jeopardy is a game for an entire group of students that

    is patterned after the TV game of similar name.  There are 6 categories,

    each with 5 levels of answers, with increasing values.


              CATEGORY 1    CATEGORY 2 ............ CATEGORY 6

                 100           100                     100

                 200           200                     200

                 300           300                     300

                 400           400                     400

                 500           500                     500


      Steps prior to playing CLASSROOM JEOPARDY
      -----------------------------------------
    
         o  The class is divided into 2 or 3 teams.

         o  A captain from each team is stationed near the computer keyboard.

         o  The CLASSROOM JEOPARDY game is started by typing "JP-GAME".


        [Registered users have the option of entering answers of their
         own choosing.  This allows the instructor to tailor CLASSROOM
         JEOPARDY to be completely compatible with the actual course
         content.]

                 
               

                        Playing CLASSROOM JEOPARDY
                        --------------------------

     Preliminary Steps

        1.  Set up for 1-3 teams, by typing the appropriate number.

        2.  Each captain chooses a key (the TEAM KEY) to type when
             his/her team wants to respond.

        3.  Each team chooses a team name and types it in.

        4.  If you wish to have a display of the time remaining in
             CLASSROOM JEOPARDY, answer "Y" and type in the number
             of minutes that you want.

        5.  Choose if you want to have sound effects used during play.

        6.  A listing of CLASSROOM JEOPARDY 'answer' files will be
             displayed, select the 'answers' of your choice and type the
             carriage return <CR>.



     Actual Play
 
        1.  One captain uses the arrow keys to highlight an amount and
                       category for the answer.

        2.  When the proper square is chosen, the carriage return or any
                       TEAM KEY is typed.

        3.  The answer is displayed in gigantic letters.

        4.  The captain, looking over his/her team, types the TEAM KEY
              when one of his/her team members raise his/her hand.

        5. The computer will display which TEAM KEY was pressed first.
                       (both audibly and on the screen)

        6. The captain of that team then calls on a member of his/her
             team to respond (should be in the form of a question).

        7.  The instructor (acting as moderator) decides if the response
              is correct, and adds (or subtracts) points accordingly.


   
        8.  If a team gives an incorrect response, then the other teams
               may make an attempt to respond and receive (or lose) points.

        9.  The last correct 'questioner' is allowed to choose the
                    category and amount of the next answer.

       10.  There is a DAILY DOUBLE.  The team picking the DAILY DOUBLE may
            wager any portion of their total (or up to 500).
  
       11.  When time has expired (either if the timer runs out or at
            the discretion of the moderator), move to DOUBLE JEOPARDY
            (type F1 then D).  After DOUBLE JEOPARDY, all teams with
            a positive score may play FINAL JEOPARDY.

       12. FINAL JEOPARDY (to get to FINAL JEOPARDY, type F1 then F) can
             be handled any way that the instructor desires.  One very
             effective way, is to have the captain wager any portion of
             their point total.  When the answer is displayed, each team
             member writes his/her question on a sheet of paper. Each
             response counts the amount of the wager.  Using this method
             affords each team member a chance to play for the team.
   
   
   
     Help during the game


        During play, type the F1 key (the function key) and the
        following screen will be displayed:


                I         Display  <I>nstructions for play

                S         <S>ound is ON  (or OFF)
           
                D         Move to <D>ouble Jeopardy

                F         Move to <F>inal Jeopardy

                Q         <Q>uit this game of Jeopardy

            space bar     Return to the game
