## Information about "CLASSROOM JEOPARDY"

    Answer: An excellent new teaching aid for your classroom.  Question:
    What is CLASSROOM JEOPARDY?
    
    If you feel your students are getting bored with the same, old
    routine, try this new program from DEC Software.  Important subjects
    such as history, math, and science become classroom fun instead of
    classroom headaches.  Teachers may design their own questions (or
    rather, answers) with the registered version, or use answers provided
    by the program.
    
    Answers will be presented in gigantic letters on the screen and can be
    seen by students up to sixty feet away.  Select your teams (two or three
    are suggested by the programmer) and divide your classroom into
    corresponding groups.  CLASSROOM JEOPARDY will prompt you for a team
    name and then ask you to assign them any key on the keyboard to ring in
    for their responses.  Repeat this process for each team.
    
    Two rounds of CLASSROOM JEOPARDY are played along with a final CLASSROOM
    JEOPARDY answer.  Correct responses can be printed through the DOS print
    command.  Point values range from 100 to 500 for the first round, 200 to
    1,000 for the second round.  Final CLASSROOM JEOPARDY wagers are based
    upon points available and daily doubles are found in each round.  You
    need to keep score manually for each team.  The team with the most
    points is the winner.
    
    Registered users receive the current version of CLASSROOM JEOPARDY, a
    module that allows customizing answers to fit course content and a
    complete user's manual.  An entertaining yet challenging game.
