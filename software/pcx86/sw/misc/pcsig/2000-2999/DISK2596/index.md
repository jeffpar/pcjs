Disk Title: Test Maker 2 of 2 (#1551 also)                              
PC-SIG Version: S2.8

Special Requirements: Hard drive. A printer is recommended.             
                                                                        
Teachers, teacher's aides, and parents -- TMAKER is here to help you at 
test time.  Tell TMAKER the subject and how many questions should be in 
the test and stand back!  Produce a quiz for the fourth period civics   
class and a quiz for the sixth period class, cover the same material and
yet, have two different tests.  Someone miss a test?  Generate one for  
him to take as make-up.  No need to worry if people have been comparing 
notes.                                                                  
                                                                        
Create a database of up to 200 questions and answers in each file with  
as many files as you have the memory to support.  You don't have to     
enter them all at once.  As you create test questions and answers, put  
them in the database.  The next time you create a test in that subject, 
enter any new questions and answers into the same database.             
                                                                        
Tests can be printed and taken in a group or the computer can run a     
single test for a student.  This one-on-one version is also good for    
tutorials and can be used by the students to create personalized study  
guides. (Optional password protection keeps private information         
private.)  Exact answers are required for the computer-driven option so 
it's ideal for questions with exact answers such as names, dates,       
numbers, yes or no, multiple choice and fill-the-blanks.                
                                                                        
The software is menu-driven, has a full help function and requires no   
special computer expertise to operate.
