************************ MIX AND MATCH ************************
          by CARR SOFTWARE  P.O. Box 3919, Merced, CA 95344-1919

GOAL

Try to match the randomly chosen color in the left paint can with the
fewest mixes (tries).  Mix your solution by choosing the intensity
(amount) of the three primary light colors (red, green, blue).

If you loved Tetris, you may love MIX AND MATCH.  In Tetris, the goal
was to correctly arrange the blocks.  The challenge was the time
constraint.  In MIX AND MATCH, the goal is to match the random color. 
The challenge is to do it with the fewest tries.

DESCRIPTION

When you press the mixing key, it mixes the red intensity, the green
intensity, and the blue intensity together and PUTS the resultant new
color in the paint can below them.  Note, they are not added to what is
already in the paint can.  What is in the paint can is thrown away
before the new color combination is put in it.  You are not mixing
AMOUNTS of red, green, and blue but LEVELS of red, green, and blue
INTENSITY.

KEYS

LEFT and RIGHT ARROW KEYS:    Selects the color to change.
UP and DOWN ARROW KEYS:    Changes color intensity.
ENTER (or INS or '+') KEYS:    Mixing key - mixes the 3 colors .
'S' KEY:    Toggles sound off and on WITHIN game.
ESC:    Quits the current game.

Hint:  Your hand doesn't need to leave the number pad if you use the
grey ENTER or '+' mixing keys that are to the RIGHT of the number pad
(the 5 key is also an down arrow key).

An alternative for enhanced keyboard owners:  use the four cursor keys
between the number pad and the regular keys.  For these keys, use the
INS mixing key that is to the right of them.

MOUSE

LEFT BUTTON:   Selects color and intensity.
RIGHT BUTTON:  Mixing key - mixes the 3 colors.

Pressing either button at most of the menus will allow you to proceed.

CHEAT MODE

Score is not eligible for TOP 10 SCORE SHEET.

SIX LEVELS

Except for level 6, the low intensities are not proportional.  To make
them visible they were given a higher number.

BACKGROUND

This game mixes colored lights not colorants.  Therefore it is not like
mixing paint.  The following is a quote from the World Book
Encyclopedia section on color:

"When lights of different colors are projected together onto a screen,
they blend and form new colors.  Mixing colored lights produces new
colors DIFFERENTLY from the way mixing colorants does.  Mixing
colorants results in new colors because each colorant subtracts some
wavelengths of light.  But mixing colored lights produces new colors by
adding light of different wavelengths.  For this reason, colored light
mixtures are sometimes called 'additive color mixtures' or 'color by
addition'."

"In an additive color mixture, the primary colors differ from those in
paint.  The 'primary colors in light' are red, green, and blue,..." 
The primary colors for paint colorants are red, yellow, and blue.
