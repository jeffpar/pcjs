## Information about "PPRINT"

    An extensive file printing system with many configurable options.
    PPRINT has an external definition file which can be tailored to
    support any printer. Many options are available to the user: Headers,
    footers, line/page numbering, lines per inch, maximum amount to print,
    start page xx, end with page xx, and many more.  Great support for HP
    LaserJet II and other similar printers with a special option for
    printing C source code.
    
    PPRINT is special and unique because it is customizable to any printer
    type.  It also allows you to access printer features not normally
    available for printing normal text files.
