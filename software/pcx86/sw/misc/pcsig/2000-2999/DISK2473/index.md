## Information about "UDECIDE"

    We all know the best way to make tough decisions is to make a list of
    options, assign relative values to them, and choose the option with the
    highest score.  But how many of us really do that?  That was before
    UDECIDE!
    
    UDECIDE helps you make tough decisions - for example, which database
    program to purchase.  The options could be PC-File, File Express, and
    Wampum.  When looking at the different programs (purchase options), you
    would develop categories of comparison like:  power, flexibility, ease
    of use, and dBase compatibility.  You would then assign number values to
    their relative importance of each category.  Now evaluate each program
    and determine how they score in each category.  Some would be easier to
    use and others more powerful, etc.
    
    By entering the importance you associate with each rating category and
    how each program is rated in that category, UDECIDE determines a
    weighted average score for each program.  The program with the highest
    score is the best one for your needs.  You can then either print out the
    complete analysis or change the ratings and perform a "what-if"
    analysis.  Use UDECIDE to decide which project to pursue, which college
    to select, which stocks to buy, or just about anything.   It can't make
    the actual decision, but it can help you think it through more clearly!
