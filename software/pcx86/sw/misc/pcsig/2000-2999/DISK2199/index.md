## Information about "CUDUP & PAR"

    Do you have a zillion files on your hard drive? Are you getting close
    to your drive's capacity? Do you have archived documents that contain
    files that are probably also somewhere else on your hard drive? Take
    care of your problem with CUDUP, the duplicate file finder!
    
    CUDUP is a menu-driven utility that reads up to 4000 files into
    memory and compares each file for any duplicates.  The files
    can reside in any subdirectory, and can be normal or compressed format.
    Specify the filename or extension you're searching for, and
    CUDUP will locate them if they exist.  If any duplicates are found,
    CUDUP will give you a list of those files and gives you the option
    deleting them.
    
    If your home were to burn down tomorrow, would you have enough
    information documented and available on your belongings to prove their
    worth and to satisfy your insurance company?  Is your estate
    documentation in good shape?  If you were to die unexpectedly, would
    your family or your lawyer know what your assets and liabilities were?
    If you answered "no" to any of these questions, you need the PERSONAL
    ASSET MANAGER (PAR).
    
    PAR provides a record of your personal or business assets.  The
    program can track the following areas:
    
    ~  Insurance policies
    
    ~  Art, jewelry, and collectibles
    
    ~  Household inventory
    
    ~  Credit card inventory
    
    ~  Safe deposit boxes
    
    ~  Safe deposit box inventory
    
    ~  Book inventory
    
    ~  Computer inventory
    
    ~  Software inventory
    
    ~  Investment portfolio
    
    ~  Video cassette recordings
    
    Each area has a set of applicable characteristics you can use to
    document your belongings.  You may add, delete, or modify subjects or
    characteristics to meet your unique needs.  PAR allows up to 18 areas
    with an unlimited number of records (up to memory capacity).
