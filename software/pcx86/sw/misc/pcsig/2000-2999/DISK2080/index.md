## Information about "WINE CELLAR"

    WINE CELLAR is a simple database designed to keep track of all the wines
    you have encountered, good and bad, and your evaluation of each one.
    This database allows you to store practically every bit of information
    about the wine:  each record contains fields for the name of the winery,
    the variety of wine, the color of the wine, the vintage year, the place
    the wine was grown and where it was bottled, the date the wine was
    bought, the cost of the wine, the percentage of alcohol, and a one line
    comment concerning how the wine tasted.
    
    WINE CELLAR allows you to edit, search, and print the records.  The wine
    records may be selectively searched by any field of the records, and the
    results may be sent to the screen or the printer.  A floppy disk will
    contain all the working files and about 1300 wine records, but the
    number of wine records that WINE CELLAR may store on a hard disk is
    practically unlimited.
