## Information about "TACTICAL COMBAT SIMULATOR"

    TCS (TACTICAL COMBAT SIMULATOR) is a wargame simulation.
    
    This interactive utility program allows two players to control
    company-size combat units.  Place mines, set spot zones, scout areas of
    a map, set obstructions (such as blown bridges), move units, call in
    artillery fire and direct ground support.
    
    Design your own game or play a pre-made game like "Panzer Leader." The
    versatility of TCS is limited only by your imagination. Use
    different scenarios in different times of history. A nice touch is the
    dimension that most games forget -- Hidden Moves. This program adds
    realism and versatility to wargaming. Each player has his own password
    and can only access his side of the game. You'll need to practice sound
    military tactics and intelligence to win. Use the Save feature and
    continue your game at a later time.
