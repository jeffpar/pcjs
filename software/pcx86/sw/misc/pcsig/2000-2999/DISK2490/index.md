Special Requirements: Hard drive.                                       
                                                                        
Spelling checkers are great to check spelling, but what do you do when  
you need to know the meaning of a word?  Pick up a book?  You won't have
to with JORJ, a computerized dictionary.                                
                                                                        
JORJ is a 58,000 word dictionary that you can run as a stand-alone      
program or as a memory-resident utility inside your favorite word       
processor (or other program).  If you don't know the spelling of a word 
or are unsure about its exact meaning just pop-up JORJ.  Type in the    
word and JORJ will display its spelling, the spelling of popular forms  
of the word (-ance, -ous, -ly, etc.), and its meaning.  You don't even  
have to know the correct spelling because JORJ will take your phonetic  
spelling and find the correct word!  For instance, if you type in       
"dayrigur" JORJ correctly answers with "de rigueur."                    
                                                                        
A helpful feature is JORJ's ability to find related words.  Scan for the
word "president" and you'll get a list of presidents.  Look up "planet" 
and get a list of the planets!                                          
                                                                        
Next time you're at a loss for words, let JORJ come to the rescue.
