## Information about "MICROMACROBAT"

    MICROMACROBAT lets your batch files perform tricks for which DOS
    makes no provision.  Simple batch file commands allow for box drawing,
    scrolling, printing, fadeout, printing of big text and a plethora of
    other functions; all in color.  Mix MICROMACROBAT commands freely with
    the batch file commands to which you are accustomed.  For example,
    putting the command MB BOX/1/1/25/80/1/31/C in your batch file draws a
    white on blue box around the entire screen and clears the inside to
    blue.  There are no complicated commands to learn and there no
    compiling steps.  MICROMACROBAT is useful for installation programs,
    back-up batch files, tutorials, demos, slide shows and any occasion for
    which you need snappy batch files.  MICROMACROBAT is a worthwhile
    utility for batch file creators and programmers.
