## Information about "MEMTOOL"

    If you're looking for a program to help you be more productive,
    MEMTOOL may be the answer. It's a memory resident program that only
    takes up 8K when properly installed. User-definable hot keys, LAN
    support, and optional diskswapping to save memory, are just a few of
    its functions. MEMTOOL will automatically use EMS memory if you have
    it.
    
    MEMTOOL features include:
    
    ~ Calculator.
    
    ~ Calendar/Appointment pad.
    
    ~ File editor.
    
    ~ DOS quick guide.
    
    ~ Diskview.
    
    ~ Phoneview.
    
    ~ Alarm clock.
    
    ~ ASCII table.
    
    ~ Screen ruler/grid.
    
    The phoneview file can hold up to 500 entries. The file editor will
    handle a file up to 35K or 2500 lines, whichever comes first, and the
    calendar/appointment pad is limited only by disk space.
    
    For those of you who aren't using a memory-resident program, MEMTOOL is
    an easy and useful set of utilities you can call on to help get your
    work done efficiently.
