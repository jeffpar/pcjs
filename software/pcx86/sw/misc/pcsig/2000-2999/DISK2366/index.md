## Information about "EGA MOUSE PAINT"

    If your children like to color pictures, EGA MOUSE PAINT will
    introduce them to using a mouse while coloring 17 pre-made pictures
    with 42 brilliant colors. A very nice feature is the ability to save a
    picture and restore it later. (This comes in handy when it's
    bedtime for the artist.) The program is very easy to use. Just point
    to the picture you want to color, choose a color, and have fun!
