## Information about "PERSONAL SECRETARY"

    PERSONAL SECRETARY could become the best secretary you've ever had!
    You'll never lose a number again because you'll have a place to store
    your contacts. Keep track of all those customer and personal contacts
    with this easy-to-use database.
    
    Log necessary information about a customer contact in a database that
    is foolproof and user-definable. Hold as many names and addresses as
    you want -- PERSONAL SECRETARY has no size limitation. For each
    customer record there is room to enter a name, address, company name,
    telephone, and a note about the customer. And if that's not enough,
    add your own fields to the record.
    
    Once the records are added, take advantage of the mini word processor
    to write letters and memos up to four pages long. The labeling and
    mail merge capability in PERSONAL SECRETARY can make mass mailings a
    snap. Don't waste any more time exiting your current database and
    entering your word processor because you need to write a letter -- do
    it all from PERSONAL SECRETARY.
