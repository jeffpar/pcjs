## Information about "LORD OF THE FLIES 2 OF 2 (#2426 ALSO)"

    You're studying LORD OF THE FLIES by William Golding.  They say
    it's a classic, that it's a statement about society.  You find it to be
    an interesting, sometimes boring, sometimes fascinating, sometimes you-
    can-see-yourself-in-the-character sort of book.  What is Golding really
    saying?
    
    The author of the shareware programs MACBETH and ROMEO AND JULIET sheds
    some more light for the high school English literature student.  In a
    captivating way and from many angles, he draws the student into the
    story, familiarizes the reader with the characters, plot, and themes,
    and leaves the student with a new comprehension of THE LORD OF THE
    FLIES.
