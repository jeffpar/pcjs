## Information about "DIVER'S LOGBOOK"

    DIVER'S LOG is for the active scuba diver or scuba club to record
    information about each dive for future retrieval and analysis.  Keep
    track of dive number, location, date, weather, and surface conditions.
    
    Now you can back up your paper log in case of loss, theft or damage.
    It's an insurance policy for your dive log.  Or, simply use it to review
    locations for the name of that great dive spot you want to dive again.
    The program is completely menu driven.  You can store up to 1,024 dives
    in a single directory.
