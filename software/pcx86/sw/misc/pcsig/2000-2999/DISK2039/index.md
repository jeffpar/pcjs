## Information about "APEX FINANCIAL MARKETS DISK 2OF2 (2038)"

    APEX FINANCIAL MARKETS allows you to analyze market indexes/averages,
    foreign exchange rates, interest rates, industry groups, and market
    breadth data.
    
    APEX FINANCIAL MARKETS is easy to set up, easy to use, and effective for
    the individual with some prior experience in the market.  The manual
    explains how to use the program but does not train the novice in
    learning the "markets game."  APEX lets you create strategies using
    single or double moving averages, based on buying long, selling short,
    or both.  A valuable feature is the charting of optimization trials,
    allowing you to see the most effective choices for short and long term
    moving averages.
    
    There is no registration fee, no start-up fee, but there is a per quote
    fee.  You can enter your own data or download it by modem from Warner
    Computer Systems, Inc.  Apex users can waive Warner's standard $48 sign-
    up fee.  Warner currently has over 330 items that can be downloaded.
    Most of the data goes back at least 10 years.  There is a sample
    database on disk two of this program, allowing some initial
    experimentation.
    
    For those active in the market, the program provides a quick means to
    gain access to current rates and to plot them on the screen for review.
    For such investors, APEX FINANCIAL MARKETS is a valuable program.
