## Information about "WORD PLAY"

    This game is the third in a series of visual puzzles from the author of
    Maze Cube (PC-SIG disk# 1419) and Wreck Tangle (PC-SIG disk# 1836). If
    you enjoyed these programs, then WORD PLAY will give you an even
    greater challenge.
    
    You're presented with shuffled letters that are required to create
    given words. Completion of each word displays a matching meaning. The
    game continues until exact placement of all letters is correct. Sound
    easy? You will be struggling to approach the top scores on any level
    without lots of practice. The exciting challenge is to achieve this in
    the least number of moves.
    
    25 different puzzles of varying degrees of difficulty are included. The
    top ten scores for each puzzle are recorded and the Masters
    Scoreboard displays the scores of the world's best player for each
    level.
    
    A nice feature is the Autoplay facility which replays your best game so
    you can see where improvements can be made. You can also easily design
    your own puzzles, up to a maximum of 99 different games. WORD PLAY is
    entirely menu-driven and provides thorough on-screen instructions.
