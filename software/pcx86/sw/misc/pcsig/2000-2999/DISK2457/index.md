## Information about "ALAMANAC"

    ALMANAC is a calendar/scheduler/information utility for Microsoft
    Windows. It provides traditional calendar displays in month and year
    format, as well as a popup desk set for day-to-day notes and schedules.
    Configuration files and overlays allow you to customize calendars for
    your business and personal needs.
    
    An overlay is a set of data which provides ALMANAC with the information
    it needs to calculate the days events will occur on.  The types of
    events ALMANAC will calculate include weekly, monthly, and annual events
    by day or date, as well as birthday, wedding anniversaries, and others.
    Up to ten overlays may be specified in a configuration file, and
    included are three sample files which define holidays for the United
    States, Canada, and Sweden.
    
    In addition to specifying overlay files, ALMANAC auto-load modules allow
    you to configure options for calculating religious holidays (Christian
    and/or Jewish), phases of the moon, and calendar mode
    (Gregorian/Jewish).  A built in database is used to determine your
    location so you can calculate the time and azimuth of the sunrise and
    sunset.
