## Information about "MEGACAD 2 OF 3 (2250, 2252 ALSO)"

    This program, developed in Germany, has sold thousands of copies
    there and is twice as fast as AutoCad.
    
    MEGACAD is a 2D CAD program for intermediate and professional use. It
    has all of the basic drawing elements such as points, lines, circles,
    arcs, text, grid, redraw, and zoom. MEGACAD also boasts more powerful
    drawing commands, such as dimensioning, hatching, macros, separate,
    layer, defaults, and group. This program offers the serious CAD
    programmer all of the options he or she will ever need.
