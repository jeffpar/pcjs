## Information about "SCRIPTURE MASTER"

    For anyone interested in Bible verses, the books of the Bible, the
    Disciples, or the Ten Commandments, here are 104 passages in each of
    the King James, New International, and New King James translations.
    
    The program is menu-driven and easy to learn and use. It checks
    verses entered and displays errors, and can print on either index cards
    or 8.5" x 11" paper. Add verses to the translations or add new
    translations. There are activities to help memorize other biblical
    information -- the books of the Bible, Ten Commandments and Disciples
    are also provided. Reports may be printed, or saved to disk and then
    viewed on-screen.
    
    By utilizing two different study techniques, you can quote a verse
    given the reference, or given a verse, cite the reference. You may
    study verses by topic, by reference, or a combination of these.
