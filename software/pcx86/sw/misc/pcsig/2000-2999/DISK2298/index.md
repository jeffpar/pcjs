## Information about "THE EXPLORERS"

    Here's a great tool for anyone at high school or college level with an
    interest in early American history.  This program has two parts: the
    EXPLORER HISTORIES and the EXPLORER QUIZ.
    
    EXPLORER HISTORIES contains information about 45 explorers who touched
    American shores and are considered to have made important historical
    contributions to America's growth.  Page through the explorers one by
    one until you have found the one you are interested in.  Once the
    explorer has been chosen, you will be shown his/her full biography,
    including birth/death date, accomplishment, and other interesting
    tidbits.
    
    It is best if the user has a good map of the U.S. for tracking the
    various expeditions.
    
    The EXPLORER QUIZ asks a series of questions on the 45 explorers.  The
    main menu provides a choice of subjects such as names of explorers,
    explorer dates, accomplishments and a fourth named POT LUCK.
