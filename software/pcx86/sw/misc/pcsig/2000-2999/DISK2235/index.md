## Information about "GENERAL LEDGER II"

    In need of a basic, no-frills accounting system to handle your
    billable time? Then GENERAL LEDGER II is for you.
    
    GENERAL LEDGER II can handle up to 300 accounts, grouped into 32
    different categories. Define both the account names and category names.
    The number of vouchers (groups of account postings) that can be handled
    is determined by available disk storage. Transaction entry is
    simplified when you call for accounts by name (or partial name) as well
    as by account number.
    
    Standard report formats eliminate the need to design reports. A check
    register automatically captures data on all checking account activity.
    A cash journal can create a double-posted petty cash journal with just
    a single entry for each transaction. Journaling has a pre-posting list
    feature that previews the posting results and makes corrections before
    final posting. The Reports menu includes an option that can print all
    of the mandatory end-of-month reports with a single keystroke.
