## Information about "$HAREWARE MARKETING $YSTEM"

    The $HAREWARE MARKETING $YSTEM is a detailed two-part resource for
    shareware authors who need creative ideas and a RATED mailing list of
    over 800 major shareware distributors, large computer clubs and
    recommended BBS systems. The first part of the package, the shareware
    distributor's database, contains mailing addresses, phone numbers, a
    SHAREWARE DISTRIBUTOR RATING and other detailed data which can be used
    to prepare envelope mailing labels or BBS calling uploads.
    
    The database file is rated by shareware distributor so you can mail
    your shareware to vendors rated A, B or C. The database file is
    supplied in standard file formats such as dBASE and 123 which can be
    directly imported into your database!  Sort lists of shareware
    distributors by zip, state or other criteria. Foreign and U.S.
    distributors and computer clubs are included.
    
    The second part of the package is a detailed newsletter and marketing
    strategy guide, prepared by an established shareware author. It
    contains dozens of creative tips, tricks and traps which every
    shareware author should know. Written by the author of the PC-LEARN
    computer tutorial, the $HAREWARE MARKETING $YSTEM provides detailed and
    valuable information in a frank, candid and sensible style.
