## Information about "MONEY WATCH"

    Do you need a simple bookkeeping and budget program to help you keep
    track of your income and expenses?  Try MONEY WATCH.
    
    MONEY WATCH functions like an electronic checkbook.  Enter income and
    expenses in the same you do in your regular checkbook.  Each entry
    consists of date, description/check #, category, and amount.  Sort new
    and changed entries into proper order based on their date and
    recalculate the balances with the push of a single key.
    
    Estimate future income needs.  Look into your financial future to see
    if planned expenses exceed expected income.  Four types of printed
    reports are provided by date and category.  Great for your tax
    records!
    
    See where your money is going, estimate future financial needs, and
    produce accurate reports for tax records.
