## Information about "APEX FUTURES & COMMODITIES DSK 1OF2 2041"

    APEX F/C will let you analyze futures/commodities with open-
    high-low-close bar charts and volume and open interest.  Futures
    files will keep the open, high, low, close, volume, and open
    interest values for each day in the data.  APEX lets you create
    strategies using single or double moving averages, based on buying long,
    selling short, or both.  A valuable feature is the charting of
    optimization trials, allowing you to see the most effective choices for
    short and long term moving averages.  For those active in the market,
    APEX FUTURES & COMMODITIES provides a means of data access with the
    added feature of plotting out the information easily.
    
    There is no registration fee, no start-up fee, but there is a per quote
    fee.  You can enter your own data or download it by modem from Warner
    Computer Systems, Inc.  There is a sample database on disk two of this
    program, allowing some initial experimentation.
    
    The program is easy to use, easy to set up, and useful.  The manual
    explains how to use the program but does not train the novice in
    learning the "markets game."
