## Information about "QUIKMATH"

    QWIKMATH is one of the most comprehensive programmer's calculator on
    the market today and provides a wide array of features.
    
    Enter values in binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal. Results are
    displayed in all these bases, as well as the ASCII or extended scan
    code equivalents. A complete range of arithmetic and bitwise
    operators is supplied. Press any ASCII or extended scan code key and
    instantly see its value in all number bases. Perform calculations with
    32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit values. A 16-level "undo" feature allows
    escape from most errors. Experiment freely in "what if" sessions
    without losing the results of prior operations. Need help? QUIKMATH has
    context-sensitive help screens.
    
    QWIKMATH's Character Format is a feature not normally found in a
    programmer's calculator. Choose how you want the character output
    treated -- in ASCII mode or extended scan code mode. See ALL the
    characters output to the screen.
    
    QWIKMATH runs as a stand-alone or memory-resident program (instantly
    popped-up with a "hot key"). Now you can have all the functions you
    will ever need in a programmer's calculator, right on your screen.
