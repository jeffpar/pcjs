## Information about "ZAPCODE"

    This is the ultimate printer control utility to burn them all away. Use
    ZAPCODE to select fonts, reset the printer, change margins,
    advance the page, and anything else your printer is capable of doing.
    It runs as memory-resident or standalone.  ZAPCODE supports all types
    of printers: laser, dot-matrix, ink-jet, and even plotters! Drivers are
    included for all the popular printers.  The printer driver editor
    allows you to easily customize or create your own, or the author will
    create yours for free.
    
    There is no longer a need to hunt for your printer manual for control
    strings.  Simply pop up ZAPCODE, select the desired printer option(s),
    and let the program enter the control strings for you -- just as if you
    had typed them at the keyboard.  It works with all programs.
