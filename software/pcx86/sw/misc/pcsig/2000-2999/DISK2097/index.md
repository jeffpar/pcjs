## Information about "FONTED DISK 2 OF 2 (ALSO 2096)"

    Want to change the fonts that are normally displayed on your EGA or VGA
    screen?  FONTED lets you change the size and shape of
    characters to suit your taste; create foreign language fonts like
    Russian, Hebrew or Arabic; or make custom fonts to suit other special
    uses.
    
    You can reduce the size of a screen font to increase the number of text
    lines displayed on the screen.  You can also save custom screen fonts in
    an executable COM file and recall them later.  And custom fonts can be
    made "sticky" with an installation procedure so you can use the fonts
    with your favorite application such as a wordprocessor.  Works great
    with or without a mouse.
