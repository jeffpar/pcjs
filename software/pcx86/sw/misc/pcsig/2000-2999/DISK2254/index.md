     PC-FASTYPE(Tm)                    Copyright 1990 Trendtech Corporation

                    Welcome to PC-FASTYPE/MONO  Version 1.1
                    =======================================

          PC-FASTYPE/MONO is a typing tutorial program SPECIFICALLY
     designed for IBM-PC's, compatibles, laptops, and portables equipped
     with monochrome or gray-scale monitors.  The quick-start instructions
     below will get you going right away.

          PC-FASTYPE/MONO can be run on any PC without regard to the type
     of monitor.  It uses character-based line-graphics to simulate the
     screen keyboard display.

          If your PC is equipped for color graphics display, then you might
     want to consider using PC-FASTYPE/CGA which can be run on any PC
     equipped with color graphics capability (CGA/EGA/VGA).  PC-FASTYPE/CGA
     uses bit-mapped graphics and basic animation techniques to simulate
     the screen keyboard display.  Contact us for more information about
     PC-FASTYPE/CGA.

     HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
          PC-FASTYPE/MONO is distributed on one 360KB 5.25" floppy, or one
     720KB 3.50" mini-floppy and requires the following minimum equipment
     to run properly:

          o  IBM PC, XT, PS/2, 286, 386, or IBM Compatible
          o  MS-DOS - All versions from 2.0 and up
          o  256KB Memory
          o  Any Monitor type
          o  1 Floppy disk drive; 3.5" or 5.25"
          o  Keyboard: either the 101-Key Enhanced with the bar-shaped
             enter key, or the AT-Style with the large L-shaped enter key.


     TO LOAD:
     From Floppy Disk Drive: Place the disk in drive A: and type:

           ENFT to start PC-FASTYPE/MONO with the 101-Key Enhanced keyboard
           ATFT to start PC-FASTYPE/MONO with the AT-Style keyboard
           PCFT to start PC-FASTYPE/MONO with the classic PC-Style keyboard

        followed by the ENTER key.  For example, the command:

                         A:> enft <enter>

        will start PC-FASTYPE/MONO from the A: floppy drive for the 101-
        Key Enhanced keyboard.

     Fixed Disk Drive: First create a sub-directory then copy the entire
     contents of the disk to the new directory. Change to the new directory
     and type ENFT or ATFT followed by the ENTER key.


     TO RUN:
          PRESS ANY KEY TO GET PAST THE TITLE AND SHAREWARE INFORMATION
     SCREENS.  After the introductory screens are displayed and the tables
     loaded, the Main Menu will be displayed.  The menu selector bar will
     be resting on the 'Begin Typing' selection.  Just press the Enter key
     or function key F10 to start a typing drill of the HOME keys.  To
     return to the Main Menu,  press the Escape key.


     WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO:
          For DRILLS:  Place the fingers of each hand on the home keys
     (ASDF JKL;) and type each letter as you are prompted for it.  The
     program selects the letters randomly.  The number of characters you
     have to successfully type is displayed before you start.  When the
     drill is finished your WPM and other statistics will be displayed in a
     separate drill statistics panel.

          For EXERCISES:  lines of text will be displayed above the screen
     keyboard; type each character pointed to by the house-shaped cursor
     (⌂) and when you reach the  symbol or end of the line, press the
     enter key (for "carriage-return"), or the space bar.  When you finish
     typing the exercise your WPM and other statistics will be displayed in
     the drill statistics screen.


     SELECTING MENU ITEMS:
          Use the arrow keys (cursor keys) to move the menu selector bar up
     and down the menu.  Select the drill, exercise, or option by pressing
     the enter key when the item you want is highlighted.  You can use the
     function keys as a short-cut.


     WHILE RUNNING:
          MENUS:
            There are 5 drill, exercise, and feature selection menus and 3
            sub-menus for selecting additional keys to learn.  The primary
            menus can be displayed by pressing function keys F1 to F5
            anytime while the screen keyboard is displayed.

          <Esc>ape key:
            Pressing the Escape key anytime during a drill or exercise will
            cause the drill or exercise to terminate and your current
            typing statistics to be displayed.  Pressing the Escape key
            again will display the menu where you started the exercise.

          QuickHELP:
            ALL menus have the QuickHELP Facility available.  For all
            menus, the function key F1 is always the HELP key.  When you
            select HELP, a QuickHELP Facility  Menu will be displayed; the
            selector bar will rest on the item matching your help request.
            Follow the instructions given on the bottom of the menu for
            navigating around the menu.


     EVALUATION PERIOD:
          You are licensed to operate PC-FASTYPE/MONO on your PC for
     testing and evaluation as to its usefulness to you, on a trial basis
     for 30 days.  We believe this to be a fair and equitable time period
     for evaluation and we trust your good judgement and sense of fair play
     in making a decision regarding registration.


     DOCUMENTATION:
          The PC-FASTYPE/MONO User Guide is included on this disk as a
     self-extracting 'ZIP' file.  This means the User Guide text has been
     'compressed' to save space on the disk.

     How To 'UN-COMPRESS' The User Guide:
          ZIP'd files can be 'un-compressed', or reconstructed without the
     need for special programs.   A self-extracting ZIP file is an
     executable file with a .EXE extension.  By simply typing in the name
     of the self-extracting ZIP file, the User Guide reconstruction process
     will be performed.  To view or print the PC-FASTYPE/MONO User Guide
     perform the following simple steps:

          1. Copy the file named FTDOC.EXE to your hard disk or
             to another floppy.  (If you try to uncompress the
             file on THIS disk you will run out of space.)
          2. Make that drive the default drive, and at the prompt
             type in the following command:

                         ftdoc <enter key>

             and the User Guide will extract itself into a
             printable, plain text document.
          3. You will now have a file called FASTYPE.DOC on your
             disk. Verify this by typing 'DIR FASTYPE.DOC' at the
             prompt.
          4. To print the User Guide on your printer, first make
             sure you have enough paper - the User Guide is about
             50 pages long.  Be sure your printer is turned ON,
             and the first page is positioned at top-of-form.
             Then type the following command at the prompt:

                    copy fastype.doc prn  <enter key>

          5. Your printer will print the PC-FASTYPE/MONO User
             Guide on about fifty pages of paper.


     INQUIRIES:
          Inquiries can be telephoned to (201) 694-8622; if there's no
     answer, please leave a message on the answering machine along with
     your name, address and daytime phone number, the version number of
     PC-FASTYPE/MONO you are using, and a short message.  We'll get back to
     you as quickly as possible.


     DATED SOFTWARE:
          If today's date is a year or more later than the file dates on
     this distribution disk than please contact Trendtech Corporation for
     information about the current version of PC-FASTYPE/MONO.  Shareware
     tends to "acquire a life of its own" once it's distributed; not all
     vendors will bother to obtain the latest version from the author.
     That is why you should buy Shareware from a disk vendor who is an
     authorized "Associate Member of the A.S.P."


     VIRUSES:
          You can only be sure of getting a top-quality virus-free version
     of any ASP Shareware product by obtaining your copy directly from the
     author, or from a disk vendor who is an Associate Member of the
     Association of Shareware Professionals, or from a reputable BBS
     service.  Be suspicious of any program you download from a BBS whose
     file dates or copyright notices are more than two years old; if it's a
     Shareware product, contact the author directly for information about
     the most current version available.


     TO PRINT THIS FILE:
          You can print this readme file to your printer (about 5 pages) by
     simply issuing the following MS-DOS command at the prompt:

          1. First insert the PC-FASTYPE/MONO disk in drive A.
          2. Then make sure your printer is turned on and the paper
             is set at top-of-form.
          3. Type:

                         COPY  A:README.TXT  PRN: <cr>

     This file provides information for bulletin board Sysops who wish
     to distribute PC-FASTYPE/MONO via their BBS systems.

     We explicitly permit uploads of the Shareware version of
     PC-FASTYPE/MONO to BBS systems.  Uploading the registered version
     is not permitted.  If you have any question as to whether the
     version which has been uploaded to your BBS is Shareware, simply
     run PC-FASTYPE/MONO and observe the title screen.  If the text to
     the right of the title screen says "Unregistered Evaluation Copy",
     and the next screen is the SHAREWARE INFORMATION screen, then it is
     the Shareware version. Anything else should be considered a
     registered version and discarded.

     Please note, if your BBS is associated with a commercial or user-
     group Shareware library which distributes disks for a fee, you must
     obtain permission in writing from Trendtech Corporation BEFORE
     placing PC-FASTYPE/MONO in the library.  See the file VENDOR.DOC
     for distribution details.  This restriction does not affect your
     permission to place PC-FASTYPE/MONO on your BBS as long as you are
     not charging a fee for its distribution. (other than normal user
     fees for general use of your board).

     If you have any questions about PC-FASTYPE/MONO please contact us
     by any of the following methods:
