## Information about "LIBERTY BELL SLOT AND WHEEL"

    LIBERTY BELL SLOT is very simple.  You pull the handle and watch three
    barrels roll.  Match numbers three across and score points.  The sound
    and action is very much like an actual slot machine.  The graphics are
    good considering it doesn't use anything other than ASCII characters.
