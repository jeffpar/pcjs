## Information about "ECOMASTER & BORDER"

    Get in touch with nature and animals, through your computer!
    ECOMASTER's an ecology simulation in which you predict how animals will
    survive in a series of different environments.  This is a game of skill
    and chance.  Some of the areas where skill comes in include learning
    which animals perform best in various environments, or
    biomes, and guessing which biome will follow the current one.
    
    This is a challenging game for everyone.  Accompanied by a dictionary
    or encyclopedia, it can also be a great way to learn about different
    animals from around the world!
    
    BORDERS is a battle for turf -- not in the city but on your computer
    screen.  In this strategy game you try to claim more area than your
    opponent while blocking his attempts to do the same.  Players take turns
    staking out their territory within a rectangular area.  Claimed areas
    can only be in the form of triangles.  Your aim is to make the largest
    triangles (thereby claiming the most area), while thwarting your
    opponent's attempts at making his triangles.  The object is to outsmart
    your opponent by enclosing more than 40% of the available area to win.
    
    You'll find this easy-to-learn game challenging and fun as you
    learn the various strategies that make or break your game.
