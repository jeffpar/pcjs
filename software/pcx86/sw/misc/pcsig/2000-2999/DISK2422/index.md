## Information about "ROMEO AND JULIET 1 OF 2 (#2423 ALSO)"

    ROMEO AND JULIET is a true classic.  But was it meant for only the
    elite few who can figure out what all those words and flowery phrases
    really mean?
    
    This program, from the author of the shareware program MACBETH, proves
    that Shakespeare can actually be understood and enjoyed by the non-
    Shakespearean fan!  Geared to aid students of English literature at the
    high school level, ROMEO AND JULIET accomplishes this seemingly
    impossible trick through the use of menu-driven quizzes and games,
    notes, and a `tour' through the Globe Theatre where the plays were first
    seen by audiences.
    
    As with his other programs, the author also offers his students The
    Competition! -- a chance to win prizes of cash and computer products,
    achievable only through a close knowledge of the play.  Definitely a
    win-win program!
