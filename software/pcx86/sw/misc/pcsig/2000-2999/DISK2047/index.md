## Information about "APEX POINT & FIGURE DISK 2 OF 2 (2046)"

    APEX POINT & FIGURE enables you to do complete point and figure analysis
    for any stock.  Stock files will contain the high, low, close, and
    volume for each day.
    
    There is no registration fee, no start-up fee, but there is a per quote
    fee.  You can enter your own data or download it by modem from Warner
    Computer Systems, Inc.  There is a sample database on disk two of this
    program, allowing some initial experimentation.
    
    The program is easy to use, easy to set up, and useful.  The manual
    explains how to use the program but does not train the novice in
    learning the "markets game."
