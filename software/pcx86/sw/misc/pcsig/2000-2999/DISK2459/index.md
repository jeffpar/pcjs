## Information about "ZIP MANAGER & MONITOR SAVER"

    Zip Manager is a Windows 3.0 shell for files compressed using PKZIP,
    ARC, and LZH formats.  It also gives you access to Vernon Buerg's
    LIST.COM program, McAffee's Virus SCAN program, and your favorite text
    editor--either DOS or Windows based.  Zip Manager is an easy way to use
    these programs in Windows.
    
    Zip Manager offers all of the available command line switches for PKZIP
    and PKUNZIP.  By simply selecting the appropriate menu item, the user
    can easily set the program to store the path name with the Zip file,
    recurse sub-directories, retain the original Zip file date, etc.
    
    Zip Manager makes it easy for even a novice to use the PKZIP programs
    in a simple point and shoot environment.  Creating a Zip file is simply
    a matter of moving through a few dialog boxes, choosing the files to
    add to the zip file, and then clicking on OK to create it.  The program
    gives the user complete control over every aspect of Zip file
    management.
    
    The commenting of Zip files has never been easier.  Zip Manager allows
    you to specify exactly how you would like to comment the file.  It even
    allows you to comment an individual file contained in a large zip file
    simply by selecting the desired file.  You are then asked to enter the
    comment for that file only.  This is a feature that is offered by no
    other program.
    
    The Windows environment is more fun to look at than DOS, but without
    this program the Windows display is likely to be burned into your
    monitor's phosphors forever.  Monitor Saver is designed especially for
    Windows 3.0 with customizable delay times and network compatibility.
    The program can blank the screen, or fill it with a moving pattern after
    a period of keyboard inactivity.
