## Information about "NONPROFIT GENERAL LEDGER"

    If you are a service or nonprofit organization, the NONPROFIT GENERAL
    LEDGER (NGL) may serve your bookkeeping needs. It uses pre-defined
    account numbers to track service groups and their related fund accounts.
    NGL does not have online help and does not use the function keys, but it
    does have a tutorial and start-up program which simplifies the
    installation process.
    
    Installation is not difficult, although familiarity with accounting
    terms is a plus. NGL uses a six digit account number system and you
    must use it. For those working in a nonprofit groups, NGL is
    especially useful since it is designed to work with multiple fund and
    service accounts. Various reports can be printed for these accounts
    which can help the group keep up with the various designated monies.
    However, there is only a consolidated report for these funds and service
    accounts. There are no fund or service tracking reports. On the up
    side, data is posted directly to the accounts for fast reporting of the
    status of the organization.
    
    The NGL manual is thorough, and is especially useful to nonprofit
    groups. The manual alone may be worth the registration fee. However,
    the program can be used by anyone, regardless of the type of
    organization. Overall, this is a good package for anyone needing a
    general ledger accounting program.
