Disk No: 2775
Disk Title: Grabber
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: Grabber
Author Version: 3.80
Author Registration: $59.00 or $29.00
Special Requirements: None.

GRABBER is a program that saves screen images to a disk file.  GRABBER
makes it very easy for you to summon the images to your screen at a
later time, exactly as they were originally displayed.

GRABBER is memory-resident.  After you start it, it's always waiting in
the background while you run other programs.  Tell GRABBER to capture
the image currently being displayed by pressing a combination of keys.

GRABBER ``captures'' the screen to an .EXE file on your disk.  When you
want to view the screen, run this .EXE file like an ordinary program.
GRABBER can also convert the captured screen file to .GIF, .PCX, and
.PIC formats.
