  Version  4.10   ProDev*EPRICE PRICING SYSTEM REGISTRATION FORM     05/01/91

  Thank  you  for evaluating my Shareware Software.  If you find that you are
  able  to  use  this software beyond the evaluation stage, you MUST register
  your  copy  with PRO DEV Software.  The Registration Fee is only $30.00 FOR
  EACH  COPY  IN  USE plus $5.00 Shipping and Handling.  The next page is the
  order form.  To insure your satisfaction, I offer the following.

                           Pre-Registration Support

      You  can  call  (preferred)  or  write  to  PRO  DEV  Software with any
      necessary   questions  about  setting  up  or  effectively  using  this
      Shareware  for  your  company.    Please  be  sure  to follow the Setup
      instructions in the README.DOC file . . .

           COPY A:README.DOC PRN  (Enter)

      .  .  .  before  calling or writing.  You must operate this system on a
      hard  disk.  You can NOT operate this system on floppy disks due to the
      size  of  the  system.   If I determine that you have received a faulty
      evaluation  copy,  I  will probably send you a complimentary evaluation
      copy.

      This system works with the ProDev*QUOTE system, and both can be ordered
      on  the  following  registration  form  to  save  an  additional  $5.00
      Shipping  and  Handling  fee.   Please see the registration form on the
      ProDev*QUOTE disk for ProDev*QUOTE warranty information.


                Here is what you will get for your registering.

  1.  You  will  receive  a  registered  copy  of  the  latest version of the
      ProDev*EPRICE system Shareware disk.     You will NOT have to enter the
      copyright  screen  random  number.    You will also be able to skip the
      closing  screen.    You  will  NOT  be  sent  a  printed  copy  of  the
      documentation  as  the  on-disk  manual  is  complete and describes all
      features.   This also holds down the registration cost of this powerful
      system.

  2.  You  will  receive  at least 1 year of telephone (preferred) or written
      support.    For  registrants  outside  the USA or Canada, I will not be
      able  to  return  telephone  calls  as  the  overseas rates can rapidly
      exceed the low registration cost.

  3.  If  within  90 days of receiving the registered disks you find that you
      are  not  satisfied  with  the  PDS*EPRICE  system,  you may return the
      REGISTERED  DISK  in  the  original  PRO  DEV  Software disk mailer (or
      equivalent) for a full refund.

  5.  If  you  discover  what  appears  to  be  a  bug, PRO DEV Software will
      attempt  to  resolve  the bug within 30 days from the time that PRO DEV
      Software   receives   your   full  telephoned  (preferred)  or  written
      description  of the bug.  If the cause of the perceived bug is a result
      of  unusual  hardware  or software that you are using, PRO DEV Software
      can  not  always  modify  the  programs  to  operate  with your unusual
      arrangements.

  Version  4.10   ProDev*EPRICE PRICING SYSTEM REGISTRATION FORM     05/01/91

Copying  Service  catalog  or  on  your  Bulletin Board Service.  You are a
vital link in the Shareware distribution process.

                               You MAY . . .

1.  This ondisk letter authorizes you to include the enclosed ProDev*EPRICE
    Version  4.10  disk  of Shareware software in your Shareware Cataloging
    and  Disk  Copying  Service.    This  is a non-exclusive authorization.
    However,  since this system is used to convert Contractor material item
    prices  from  3  USA and 2 non-USA pricing services to the ProDev*QUOTE
    Quotation  system file format, it MUST be carried with the ProDev*QUOTE
    system  in  your  catalog.   Further,  the ProDev*EPRICE system MUST be
    listed contiguously with the ProDev*QUOTE system.  The two systems work
    together  for  the  fast  growing  numbers  of  contractors  purchasing
    Shareware software.

2.  You  may  sell  disks containing copies of this software as long as you
    do  NOT  imply  to  your customers that this is "free" software.  It is
    best  if  your  catalogs  make it clear that this is Shareware software
    that  the  end  user  must  register  with PRO DEV Software to continue
    using beyond the evaluation stage.

3.  If  you  are  a Disk Copying or Bulletin Board Service and you obtained
    this  software  from  other than PRO DEV Software, you may not have the
    latest  version.   You are encouraged to write or call PRO DEV Software
    and ask for the latest version.

4.  You  may  add  your own files to this disk as long as none of them give
    any impression that this Shareware software is "free".


                             You may not . . .

1.  DO  NOT  remove any of the following files from the disk (or compressed
    file if you are a BBS):

    PRICPROG.EXE  PRICEDAT.EXE   PRINTERS.EXE   PRICEDOC.EXE  LIST.COM
    NPSORDER.DOC  PLMORDER.DOC   TSCORDER.DOC   TSAORDER.DOC  TSIORDER.DOC
    VENDOR.DOC    INSTALL.EXE    REGISTER.DOC   README.DOC

    LIST.COM  is  included on this disk with written permission from Vernon
    Buerg and may NOT be removed or replaced with a different version.

                  Vendor Encouragements And Restrictions

2.  Further,  if you are a Disk Copying Service, please do not compress the
    above  files.    Do  NOT put one of my competitors products on the same
    disk!    Naturally,  a  BBS operator will compress the entire system as
    required.  If you sell 720k or 1.44m disks, you can combine this system
    with ProDev*QUOTE and ProDev*QUOTE Utilities disks.

3.  You  may  not replace the PRICEDOC.EXE SCRNCHed documentation file with
    the  ASCII  EPRICE.DOC  file  or  another form of archiving, packing or
    ziping.    Further,  you may not unLHARC the PRICPROG.EXE, PRINTERS.EXE
    or  the  PRICEDAT.EXE  files.    If you are a BBS, archive/pack/zip the
    above  files  along  with  the other files WITHOUT first unSCRNCHing or
    unLHARCing  those  files.    This is because my INSTALL program expects
    the SCRNCHed and LHARCed files.


I  also  encourage  you  to  give this full featured system the write-up it
deserves  in  your  catalog.    The  next  page  gives my "unbiased" {grin}
suggested  catalog  descriptions.    I  really  get  discouraged when I see
catalogs  that just say "ProDev*EPRICE  Contractors Pricing System".  It is
really  a  powerful,  low  registration  fee  system  that  will  allow the
Contractor  to use the ProDev*QUOTE  Quotation  system  and ALSO be able to
receive weekly price updates from the Pricing Services.

Now  that I have gotten all of that legal stuff out of the way, let me tell
you what is in Version 4.10.  The ProDev*QUOTE system has been evolving for
12  or  14 years, first on a mainframe computer and then as Version 3.0 for
PC/MS-DOS  Shareware  about  4  years  ago.    Version  4.01 was a complete
upgrade  using  pull-down  menus and dBASE compatible files limited only by
available disk space.


                            PDS*EPRICE FEATURES

The  publishing  of  the  ProDev*EPRICE  system  has been requested by many
Electrical,  Plumbing,  Heating  and  Air  Conditioning Contractors who are
registrants  of the popular and low priced ProDev*QUOTE system.  Typically,
the  prices  of  Quote/Bid  software,  compatible  with  the National Price
Service,  Trade  Service  Corporation,  Trade  Service  Of Australia, Trade
Service  Information (UK) or Plumlee Custom Publishers (USA) weekly/monthly
price  updates,  cost  in  the  range  of  $800  to  $2,500.    NOW,  these
Contractors  have a cost effective alternative.  They can take advantage of
their  newly  purchased  low  cost  computer  without  having pay such high
prices.    This release is to coordinate with ProDev*QUOTE Version 4.10 and
includes only minor changes.


    Very truly yours,
