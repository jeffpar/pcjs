PC-SIG Version: S2                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: DAYO Bar Code                                            
Author Version: 2.0                                                     
Author Registration: $25.00                                             
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, a hard drive, and DOS 3.3.              
                                                                        
DAYO is a collection of multiuser business applications that provide a  
means of managing inventory, purchasing, invoicing, customers, vendors, 
sales and more... All DAYO products are multiuser, designed to work on a
Microcomputer (PC) Based Local Area Network (LAN), like Novell (tm).    
They can, however, work as a 'standalone', running on a single PC.      
                                                                        
To date, large and complex mulituser business applications required Mini
and Mainframe computers, but because of products like the PC based LAN/ 
Network, they can now be run on microcomputers. DAYO is one of the first
microcomputer based business applications designed to handle such a     
system.                                                                 
                                                                        
DAYO BAR CODE prints 3 of 9 bar codes onto an Epson (tm) or IBM (tm)    
compatible dot matrix printer. It is integrated with the DAYO Inventory 
and the DAYO Customer databases. It can be used as a standalone         
application if you just have a limited number of labels to print, or    
have no use for an inventory control or account receivable application. 
Labels are printed onto standard labels (3.5 by 15/16 inches at 6 lines 
per inch). The inventory bar code label consists of an item number, its 
bar code, with the option to also print the vendor item number,         
description, unit of issue, weight, and bin/location. The customer bar  
code label consists of a customer number, its bar code, with the option 
to also print the customer's name and telephone number.                 
                                                                        
Inventory and Customer bar codes can be printed by 'browsing' through   
their respected databases using multiple indexes. When a desired item or
customer is found, just press enter to print. Batch printing of item bar
codes is possible based on the item type, class, location, receipts, and
purchase orders.                                                        
                                                                        
DAYO Business Applications grow with your company. The ability to       
upgrade your system is available with the addition of other DAYO        
products. Source to DAYO is also available, allowing you to make further
modifications and enhancements. DAYO Clock was written with Qbasic (tm);
all others were written with Clipper (tm).

additional or alternative source of support and reporting.
