## Information about "MODEL-S DISK 1 OF 2 (2071 ALSO)"

    MODEL-S is a CASE tool for developing database applications.  This is a
    quality product that can rival any commercial package in its class.  In
    fact, our research indicates that MODEL-S is unique in its design and
    functionality.
    
    MODEL-S is a powerful piece of software that automates the development
    process yet does not require data processing expertise.  It utilizes the
    rapid prototyping approach to application development, integrated with
    automatic generation of the dBASE III Plus programs and data files (.PRG
    and .DBF).
    
    MODEL-S was designed to enable end users and data processing
    professionals to engage in a true joint application development, which
    promotes active participation of both in most aspects of the development
    process.  It helps producing systems on time, within budget, and with
    complete user satisfaction -- all that at a fraction of the traditional
    development cost.
