## Information about "DIRECTORY FREEDOM"

    DIRECTORY FREEDOM is intended for the person with a basic working
    knowledge of subdirectories, etc., by remembering filenames when, for
    example, they wish to selectively copy some files from a hard disk
    subdirectory.
    
    It's a fast, compact (12K) alternative to a DOS shell and provides for
    selective file and directory operations (e.g., copying files), a
    scrollable environment for examining the contents of directories, and
    user-defined keys to operate on selected files.  For example, define
    the CONTROL-F1 key to be an editor (e.g., QEDIT).  Highlight a file in
    the directory, press CONTROL-F1 to move immediately into the editor and
    operate on the file.  Colors, directory sort order, and the setting of
    the DOS Verify flag can all be customized.
