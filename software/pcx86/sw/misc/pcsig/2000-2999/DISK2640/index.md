ANIMATED SHAPES teaches shape and color identification using a colorful 
menu system designed for children pre-school through the first grade.   
Each shape correctly identified combines with other shapes to create    
a picture.  Upon completion, the picture becomes an entertaining        
mini-movie.                                                             
                                                                        
When you register ANIMATED SHAPES, you're sent a version personalized   
with your child's name as well as fifteen new animations.
