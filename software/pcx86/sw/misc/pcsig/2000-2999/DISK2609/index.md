     I.  DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE

     Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before
     buying it.  If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you
     are expected to register.  Individual programs differ on details.
     Some request registration while others require it, some specify a
     maximum trial period.  With registration, you get anything from the
     simple right to continue using the software to an updated program with
     printed manual.

     Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and
     the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
     exceptions as stated below.  Shareware authors are accomplished
     programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs ar e of
     comparable quality.  (In both cases, there are good programs and bad
     ones!)  The main difference is in the method of distribution.  The
     author specifically grants the right to copy and distribute the
     software, either to all and sundry or to a specifi c group.  For
     example, some authors require written permission before a commercial
     disk vendor may copy their Shareware.
     
     Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.  You
     should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether
     it's commercial or Shareware.  The Shareware system makes fitting your
     needs easier, because you can try before you buy.  A nd because the
     overhead is low, prices are low also.  Shareware has the ultimate
     money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you don't pay
     for it.
     
     II.  DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT
     
     Users of Painless Companion must accept this disclaimer of warranty:
     "Painless Companion is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all
     warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation, the
     warranties of merchantability and of fitness for an y purpose.  The
     author assumes no liability for damages, direct or consequential,
     which may result from the use of Painless Companion."
     
     Painless Companion is a "shareware program" and is provided at no
     charge to the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your
     friends, but please do not give it away altered or as part of another
     system.  The essence of "user-supported" software i s to provide
     personal computer users with quality software without high prices, and
     yet to provide incentive for programmers to continue to develop new
     products.  If you find this program useful and find that you are using
     Painless Companion and continue to use Painless Companion after a
     reasonable trial period, you must make a registration payment of
     $45.00 to Painless Accounting.  The $45.00 registration fee will
     license one copy for use on any one computer at any one time, and you
     will receive a printe d manual.  You must treat this software just
     like a book.  An example is that this software may be used by any
     number of people and may be freely moved from one computer location to
     another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used at one
     location while it's being used at another.  Just as a book cannot be
     read by two different persons at the same time.


                                 PAGE 1


     

     Commercial users of Painless Companion must register and pay for their
     copies of Painless Companion within 30 days of first use or their
     license is withdrawn.  Site-License arrangements may be made by
     contacting Painless Accounting.
     
     Anyone distributing Painless Companion for any kind of remuneration
     must first contact Painless Accounting at the address below for
     authorization.  This authorization will be automatically granted to
     distributors recognized by the (ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for
     shareware distributors, and such distributors may begin offering
     Painless Companion immediately (However Painless Accounting must still
     be advised so that the distributor can be kept up-to-date with the
     latest version of Painless Companion.).

     You are encouraged to pass a copy of Painless Companion along to your
     friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their copy
     if they find that they can use it.  All registered users will receive
     a copy of the latest version of the Painless Companion system, and a
     printed manual.

     If you try to access a company and receive the error message that the
     company is not installed, you must run the install process to create
     the data files for the company.  You could also receive this message
     if an invalid path is entered and the data file s are not found.
     
     VII.  GRAPH
     
     1.  CREATE GRAPH
     
     Select this option to create your graph formats.  You must first
     select the desired data file to graph.  All the data files will be
     displayed on the screen.  Highlight the file to graph and press enter,
     or press the letter or number corresponding to the d ata file you want
     to graph.

     Now you will be asked to provide a name for this graph.  You may then
     enter a graph title, which will be printed at the top of the graph.
     You can also specify a X-axis an Y-axis title.  The X-axis title will
     appear along the bottom of the graph and the Y-axis title will appear
     along the left side of the graph.

                                 PAGE 3



     
     Next the fields from the data file selected will be displayed.  You may
     then select the field description to sort by.  Only alphanumeric fields
     will be displayed for sorting.  When the graph is generated, it will be 
     sorted by this selection.  Next you must select the X-axis. It will 
     only allow numeric fields for the X-axis.  These will be displayed for 
     each element graphed.  For example, if you are graphing your expense 
     accounts, and select account number for the X-axis, for each account 
     graphed the account number will be displayed along the bottom.
     
     You can then select up to five Y-axis, these can only be numeric
     fields.  For example, if you are graphing your expense accounts, and
     select this month balance and previous balance, these two balances
     will be graphed for each expense account.  The only ex ception is if
     you generate a pie chart.  In this case only the first Y-axis will be
     graphed.  To save the graph press F10.
     
     2.  EDIT GRAPH
     
     Select this option to make modifications to any graph created.  All
     graphs created will be displayed on the screen.  Select the one you
     want to edit.  At this point you may go through and make any
     modifications necessary.

     3.  GENERATE GRAPH
     
     Select this option to generate the graphs to the screen, printer, or
     to a file.  All graphs created will be displayed on the screen.
     Select the graph you wish to generate.  Next you can enter a low range
     and a high range to graph, you can also Press F4 a nd select
     individual items.  You can specify if you want a legend or if you want
     hatching.  The legend will appear in the upper right hand corner
     indicating the Y-axis fields selected.  If you select hatching, when
     doing a bar chart, the bar will have lin es through it instead of just
     being a solid bar.
     
     You must also specify where you want the graph to be sent.  You may
     send it to the screen, printer, or to a file.  If you select screen
     the graph will be displayed on the screen.  If you select printer, you
     can then select if you want to print the graph i n portrait or
     landscape mode.  You may also specify the horizontal and vertical size
     of the graph to print.  The default horizontal and vertical size is
     one, for the standard graph size.  If you want the graph to be printed
     bigger enter in a higher number.  If you want the graph to be smaller
     enter in a lower number.  If you select file you will then be prompted
     to enter in the file name in which to save the graph.  You may then

                                 PAGE 4


     
     You will then be prompted to select the type of graph to generate.
     Highlight the desired graph type or press the number corresponding to
     that graph type.  The graph will then be generated.
     
     4.  RECALL GRAPH
     
     Select this option to look at a graph that has already been generated
     and saved in a file.  All graphs saved will be displayed on the
     screen.  Select the graph you wish to recall.  You may then display
     the graph to the screen or send it to the printer.
     
     VIII.  REPORTS
     
     
     1.  CREATE REPORTS

     select a data file.  All the data files will be displayed on the
     screen.  Highlight the file to use and press enter, or press the
     letter or number corresponding to the data file you wish to select.
     
     Now the fields from the data file selected will be displayed.  You
     must then select the field to sort by.  You can then enter up to 10
     fields, and indicate whether to subtotal (S), total(T), or group(G) on
     the fields selected and enter in a heading for e ach field selected.
     The heading you input will be the heading printed above that
     particular column.  Press F10 to save the report format.

     When you select a numeric field you have the option to group on this
     field.  For example, if you select the accounts file and sort by
     account type, and enter the account type as a field to group on, and
     select to subtotal on the previous balance, each tim e the account
     type changes you will get a subtotal for the previous balance.  You
     may only total or subtotal on numeric fields.  If you opt to total on
     the previous balance, the total of all previous balances will be
     displayed at the end of the report.

     When you select to group on a field, every time this field changes,
     subtotals will be printed for any field you have chosen to subtotal.
     One thing to be aware of, is if you group on account number and
     subtotal on previous balance, you will get a subtotal for each account
     number.  This is because each account number is different.  You should
     only group on fields that are not unique.
     
     2.  EDIT REPORT
     
     Select this option to edit a report.  All the reports created will be
     displayed.  You can select the one you wish to edit.  The report will
     be loaded and you can make any changes necessary.  If you need to
     change field five, you must go through all the pr evious fields before
     you can change field five.  Then you can Press F10 to save the change.

Companion, Painless Accounting authorizes distribution only in
accordance with the following restrictions.  Please refer to the
additional information listed below which is specific to ASP and non-
ASP Disk Vendors, Computer Clubs, and Disk-of-the-Month style

The Painless Accounting/Payroll Companion package is defined as
containing all the material listed in the README.1ST  text file.  If
any files listed in the PACKING.LST text file, or the PACKING.LST file
itself, are missing, then the package is not complete and distribution
is forbidden.  Please contact us to obtain a complete package suitable
for distribution.

    o  The Painless Accounting/Payroll Companion package - including
       all related program files and documentation files - CANNOT be
       modified in any way and must be distributed as a complete package,
       without exception.  The PACKING.LST text file contains a list of
       all files that are part of the Painless Accounting/Payroll
       Companion package.

    o  No price or other compensation may be charged for the
       Painless Accounting/Payroll Companion package.  A distribution
       cost may be charged for the cost of the diskette, shipping and
       handling.

    o  The Painless Accounting/Payroll Companion package CANNOT be
       sold as part of some other inclusive package.  Nor can it be
       included in any commercial software packaging offer, without a
       written agreement from Painless Accounting.  For information on
