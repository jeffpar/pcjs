## Information about "LZE, LZESHELL, & COMTOEXE"

    Can you imagine the space you could reclaim from your hard drive by
    compressing all the .EXE files? Well, LZE, a public domain program,
    compresses an .EXE file to almost half its size! This isn't
    compression that must be decompressed to use the file; this is
    compression of the code, so the program can be used as is.
    
    LZE works with companion program COMTOEXE (which converts .COM files to
    .EXE files) to make a powerful compression package.
    
    LZESHELL interacts with LZE and COMTOEXE (all public domain programs)
    to make those programs even better.  LZESHELL changes .COM files to
    .EXE files with one command.  LZE then compresses the code of .EXE
    files to regain space on your hard drive.
    
    A companion program to LZE, COMTOEXE converts a .COM file into an .EXE
    file that can then be compressed by LZE (LZE compresses the code of
    .EXE files).  With the combination of the two files, you now have the
    ability to reclaim a sizable amount of valuable disk space from both
    .COM and .EXE files.
