## Information about "DAYO INVENTORY"

    DAYO INVENTORY is a multiuser inventory control, purchasing, and vendor
    maintenance application.
    
    Use DAYO INVENTORY to create and maintain an inventory of any
    product.  Create and print purchase orders on a standard printer or a
    Hewlett Packard LaserJet. Receive purchase orders into inventory with
    the option of printing receivers and inventory tags/price labels.
    Maintain a vendor database complete with the vendor's purchasing
    history. With the exception of ongoing data entry of new products and
    vendors, DAYO INVENTORY is totally menu driven. Since DAYO INVENTORY is
    multiuser, it is capable of operating on most of the PC-based
    networks; i.e., Novell. Other features include reports, labels, lists,
    and a graph.  A simple database management module is also included to
    provide you with additional means to modify, view, and report your
    data.
