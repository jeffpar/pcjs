## Information about "DAYO AR 2 OF 2 (#2409 ALSO) (ACCTS REC)"

    DAYO AR (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE) is the "final chapter" to the processing
    and maintenance of all your Receivables. DAYO AR includes routines to
    handle cash receipts, customers, invoice types, terms, taxcodes, sales
    persons, and more. Many reports are included (i.e., Ageing, Customer,
    Sales...). There is a routine to print Statements (i.e., SMART, 90, 60,
    30 days), and another one to create and print `non'standard invoices.
    HP Laser forms are provided as an option for Statements and Invoices.
