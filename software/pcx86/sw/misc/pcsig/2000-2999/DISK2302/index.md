## Information about "PICTURETHIS 4 OF 4 (1130,1474,2301)"

    Quickly and easily prepare professional-looking drawings for printing
    on PostScript-compatible laser printers and imagesetters with
    PICTURETHIS.  Do them either freehand or by tracing ``template''
    screens captured with a companion program, CAPTURETHIS.
    
    Use PICTURETHIS even if you don't know how to program in the
    PostScript page description language.  View a screen representation of
    your drawing as you prepare it, easily making additions and
    alterations.  Print PICTURETHIS drawings at lower resolution on some
    dot-matrix printers, using the graphics screen dump program supplied
    with DOS.
    
    PICTURETHIS doesn't need a lot of fancy hardware -- just an IBM PC, XT,
    AT, or compatible.  It doesn't even require direct access to a laser
    printer.  Drawing files can be sent by mail or modem to a laser
    typesetting service bureau for overnight return of low-cost prints with
    300, 1270, or even 2540 dots-per-inch resolution.
