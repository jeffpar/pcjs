## Information about "FLODRAW DISK 3 OF 3 (912 AND 913 ALSO)"

    FLODRAW is a graphics editor that produces black and white full-page
    diagrams.  It is designed to handle symbols quickly and easily and is
    ideal for documentation such as flowcharts, organization charts, system
    diagrams and other symbol-oriented materials.  It combines text and
    graphics and is equipped with a basic graphics editor for lines and
    circles, plus pixel editing.
    
    FLODRAW has symbol libraries for flowcharts, HIPO charts, and electric
    diagrams.  Design your own symbols, save them, and combine them into new
    libraries, or add them to an existing library.
