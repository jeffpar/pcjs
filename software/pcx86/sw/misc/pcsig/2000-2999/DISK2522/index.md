UNOSCORE is an eye-popping version of card game UNO.  In UNO there are  
four sets of numbered cards; each set is a different color.  You are    
dealt seven cards to start the game; you have to match the last card    
laid down, in color or number.  If you don't have a match, you have to  
draw a card.  The winner is the first to play all his cards.            
                                                                        
Great graphics make UNOSCORE a joy to play.  UNOSCORE is easy to learn, 
yet challenging for all ages.  It's also a great way to teach young     
children pattern matching skills while having fun!
