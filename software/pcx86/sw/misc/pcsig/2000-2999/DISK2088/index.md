## Information about "20TH CENTURY FARO"

    FARO is one of the oldest gambling card games ever to grace the casino.
    If you enjoy fast-moving casino games, you'll love this unique
    simulation called 20TH CENTURY FARO.
    
    All bets which can be placed in the casino game are available in this
    program for one player.  Even the casekeeper is displayed in the same
    way it would appear in a casino.  A "Farobank" keeps track of all money
    lost by or paid to the player, letting you know how you're doing
    against the computer opponent.  Like real Faro, it's the house that
    usually comes out ahead.  But you never know -- it could be your lucky
    day.
