## Information about "PFAS  1 OF 2 (#2476 ALSO)"

    PERSONAL FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM (PFAS) is a small business
    checkbook manager to make bank reconciliation much faster and easier.
    PFAS provides the necessary information to get through any bank
    reconciliation statement. It can handle 1000 transactions for each
    account for a full calendar year. An outstanding feature lets you
    configure a customized chart of accounts to properly track your
    expenditures. This is a strong plus at tax time.
    
    PFAS has full edit, insert, and delete features, and the current
    bank balance and true account balance are posted at the top of the
    screen. You can issue date-specified reports to the screen and/or
    printer. You can search and list transactions to screen only, or
    printer, by any whole or partial "issued to" name, by date, or by check
    number.
    
    Screens look very similar to many dBase programs in their style of
    screen prompting. As a result, PFAS offers good, clear-cut instructions
    to get any beginning user off the ground quickly.
