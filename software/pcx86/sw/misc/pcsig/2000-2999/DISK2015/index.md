## Information about "CHEX"

    CHEX is a bookkeeping program for balancing checks, credit cards, and
    savings accounts. The program looks and feels just like the recording
    section in your own checkbook. For each item or check you write, you
    may enter the date, check number, whether it is a debit or credit, who
    the item is written out to, a short note, and a category code. As the
    amount for each check is entered, the program will keep a running total
    of your bank statement.
    
    CHEX is easy to use because all information is entered and displayed in
    a list divided into columns on the screen. At any time you may sort the
    checkbook by date, allowing you to enter checks in any order you please.
    The program can balance the checkbook at the press of a button. CHEX
    can print an individual check, the entire checkbook, or a financial
    graph and total for the last 60 months. CHEX will allow you to
    customize the standard print format for your own checks. Continuous
    forms are not required. You may also export the checkbook information
    into LOTUS 1-2-3. CHEX has on-line, context-sensitive help, password
    and encryption protection, and an automatic saving feature which
    activates after a specified period of time with no input from the
    keyboard.
