## Information about "CODE TO CODE"

    CODE-TO-CODE, the "Norton Utilities" of desktop publishing does two
    things to make desktop publishing (DTP) easier.
    
    Edit your typesetting codes from .DTP programs like Ventura
    Publisher, XyWrite III, Magna, Penta, or any word processor that can
    produce an ASCII version of a file (most do).
    
    To do this, it takes a .DTP file and separates it into two files -- one
    with the typesetting codes and one with the written text. Edit the text
    file in your favorite word processor and use CODE-TO-CODE's Search and
    Replace features to make changes to the typesetting code file. When
    you're done making changes, CODE-TO-CODE will combine the two files the
    same way it split them.
    
    CODE-TO-CODE also makes working with large files easier. It splits
    large files into smaller ones. Do this by either specifying a group of
    characters to split on, or the maximum size of the split files (64K
    maximum). Finish your editing and then CODE-TO-CODE easily recombines
    them.
