   This package is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge to the
   user for evaluation. Feel free to share it with your friends, but please 
   do not give it away altered or as part of another system. The essence of 
   "user-supported" software is to provide personal computer users with 
   quality software without high prices, and yet to provide incentive for 
   programmers to continue to develop new products. If you continue to use 
   these fonts or utilities after a trial period of 20 days, you must make a
   registration payment of $49.50 to Elfring Soft Fonts. The $49.50 regis-
   tration fee will license one copy of this package for use on any one 
   computer at any one time. You must treat this software just like a book. 
   An example is that this software may be used by any number of people and 
   may be freely moved from one computer location to another, so long as 
   there is no possibility of it being used at one location while it's being 
   used at another. Just as a book cannot be read by two different persons 
   at the same time.

   tributors recognized by the (ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for share-
   ware distributors, and such distributors may begin offering this package 
   immediately, (however Elfring Soft Fonts must still be advised so that 
   the distributor can be kept up-to-date with the latest version of this 
   package).
   
   You are encouraged to pass a copy of this package along to your friends
