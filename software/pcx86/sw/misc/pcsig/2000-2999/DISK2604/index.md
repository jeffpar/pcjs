SkyGlobe is a very fast, fun, and easy-to-use Shareware astronomy       
program. The splendor of the heavens comes to life on your computer     
screen, especially on a color EGA or VGA system. The program also runs  
on CGA and Hercules systems, and creates printouts on Epson compatible  
printers. See up to 15,000 stars displayed, over twice as many as are   
visible to the naked eye. Turn the constellation lines on or off with a 
single keystroke in a fraction of second. Change viewing direction or   
location just as quickly. Use the Automatic mode to watch the movement  
of the stars throughout the night. Since the planets, Sun, and Moon are 
also displayed, SkyGlobe is the best way to learn about the wonderful   
show that goes on in our skies every night.

                        Quick  Starting  Instructions

        These instructions will enable you to get SkyGlobe up and
    running as quickly as possible. Then you can return to the
    manual to learn about SkyGlobe's advanced features.

        SKYGLOBE.COM and SKYGLOBE.DAT are the only files that are
    absolutely necessary in order to run SkyGlobe. If you wish to
    view the planets for years other than 1991, or you wish to see
    more than 7000 stars, you will need the appropriate .DAT files
    as well. Make certain these files are in the currently active
    directory, type SKYGLOBE, and press the Enter key.

        When the program is started, you will be prompted to select
    the appropriate video mode for your system. Use the cursor keys
    to make your selection, and press Enter.
        Now it is time to select your viewing location. SkyGlobe has
    pre-defined coordinates for almost 240 locations, on two pages.
    The first page contains choices for US and Canadian locations.
    Use the cursor keys to choose a location, and press Enter. If
    you choose the last spot on the menu, (use the End key), the
    international menu will appear. The cities are grouped by region,
    more or less, with a few more Canadian cities leading off. Use
    the last spot again to return to the US menu.
        When SkyGlobe is first started, it comes up in Auto-Increment
    mode. The Time and Date are initially set to the current system
    time and date. The Time is then continually incremented by five
    minutes, the program default, as fast as SkyGlobe can update the
    screen. You can increase or decrease the amount of increment by
    pressing 'F' or 'Shift-F'. You can change the increment direction
    by pressing 'Shift-A', or toggle the increment type between Time
    and Date by pressing 'Alt-A'.
        Let's try a few of the commands. First press 'A' to stop the
    Automatic increment of time. Press 'B' for Brightness a few times
    and watch more stars appear. To check the value of the Brightness
    Index, look at the parameter display on the left-hand side of the
    screen.
        Most actions in SkyGlobe are reversed by using the Shift key.
    Press 'Shift-B', and watch the dimmest stars vanish. Try 'Z' and
    'Shift-Z' to Zoom in and out.
        Want to change the time? Try 'M', 'H', 'D' and 'T' for Month,
    Hour, Day and Time (in minutes). Increase the number of Constell-
    ation Lines displayed by pressing the Space bar, then delete some
    by pressing 'Shift-SPACE'. (Make sure to hold down the Shift key
    for this until you're done deleting lines.) Use the cursor keys
    to change the Viewing Direction and Elevation. And if you ever
    need to use your computer for something besides SkyGlobe, press
    'Q' to return to DOS.

        I hope this quick introduction has gotten you well started
    with SkyGlobe. More detailed descriptions of the commands appear
    in the following pages. Have fun!
                                   -4-

                     SkyGlobe  Command  Descriptions

        If you decide to register SkyGlobe, you will receive a Handy Refer-
   ence Card that will remind you of SkyGlobe commands. The inside of the
   Reference Card contains two lists of the 300 brightest stars, as well as
   lists of the constellations and Messier Objects. These lists will help
   you when using the Object find command. This .DOC file contains similar
   information as its last few pages.


                         Time and Date Commands

        SkyGlobe provides many ways to change the Time or Date of the
   displayed sky view. You can change the Time forward or backward by a
   minute, an hour, or half an hour. The Date can be changed forward or
   backward by a day, a month, or half a month. For viewing the planets,
   you may also change the year. Use the table below:

                                Forward              Backward
   1   Minute             Press 'T'            Press 'Shift-T'
   1   Hour                     'H'                  'Shift-H'
   1/2 Hour                     'Alt-H'              'Alt-Shift-H'
   1   Day                      'D'                  'Shift-D'
   1   Month (30 days)          'M'                  'Shift-M'
   1/2 Month (15 days)          'Alt-M'              'Alt-Shift-M'
   1   Year                     'Y'                  'Shift-Y'

        One of SkyGlobe's most useful features is the Auto-Increment mode.
   This gives you the ability to simulate the passage of time on your com-
   puter. To enter or exit this mode, press 'A'. The sky view will begin
   to change in a manner that depends on the Auto-Increment parameters. To
   see these parameters, press 'F2' until they are visible on the left-hand
   display. Use 'Alt-A' to change the increment type from Time to Date and
   back. Use 'Shift-A' to change the direction of increment from Forward to
   Backward and back. You can also change the speed of increment. Press 'F'
   to increase the speed, and 'Shift-F' to slow back down. Only the active
   increment type, either Time or Date, is affected by the 'F' key.

        V2.5 of SkyGlobe adds two new features to the Auto-Increment mode.
   Press 'R' to enter (or disable) Real-Time mode. This will synchronize
   the Time and Date to the system clock. You still have control over all
   commands except those related to Time and Date. Press 'Shift-R', and
   the Increment speed will be set to one Sidereal day, or 1436 minutes.
   This has the effect of seeming to freeze the star and constellation
   display, while allowing the planets to continue their progress along
   the ecliptic. This is useful for learning about retrograde motion, as
   well as teaching something about the relative speeds of motions of the
   planets.

        SkyGlobe uses Daylight Saving Time where and when it thinks it is
   appropriate. This is denoted by an upper-case 'AM' or 'PM' in the Time
   display. An asterisk is also displayed near the time, when daylight time
   is active. You can defeat or reinstate the use of Daylight Time by press-
   ing 'V'. While you can turn off Daylight Time, there is currently no way
   to force its use for a particular date, so if SkyGlobe is off by a few days
   in its estimate of Daylight Time use, you will have to allow for it. I plan
   to improve this soon.

                        Where  Are  We  Looking?

        Now let's learn about how SkyGlobe interprets directions. The
   program assumes you are standing outside and that your eyes are
   facing the direction your feet are pointing. This is the View Dir-
   ection. The display shows this direction in degrees, ranging from
   0 for due north, through 180 degrees for due south, to 350 degrees
   for 10 degrees west of north. The View Direction is also indicated
   along the Horizon line by initials.

        The View Elevation ranges from 0 degrees to 180. The Horizon
   appears as a straight line at the 0 degree setting. It might help
   to imagine that you are extremely short for this one, so that the
   ground covers the lower half of your eyes, but is transparent. The
   90 degree setting is like looking straight overhead at the Zenith.
   SkyGlobe also permits you to bend over backwards, figuratively speak-
   ing, and pretend that you are viewing the sky behind you. Since the
   View Direction still stands for your feet, moving around might be
   little confusing when you view the sky this way.

                          Lines  And  Labels

        One of the most useful features of SkyGlobe is its ability to
   quickly and easily change the lines and labels that help our eyes
   and minds make sense of the vastness of the sky. This can be very
   helpful to the novice just learning the stars. Use the Space bar
   to increase the number of Constellation Lines displayed. As always,
   use the Shift key to reduce the number of lines. The Constellation
   Lines have been grouped by importance, with some constellations
   having several classes of lines. The constellations also have
   abbreviations available for display. Use 'C' to display more of
   these, 'Shift-C' for fewer. The abbreviations are in the same
   groupings as the lines. The 300 brightest stars can be labelled
   by using 'L' and 'Shift-L' to see more or fewer labels.

        V2.5 of SkyGlobe has added the capability to show an approximate
   outline of the Milky Way and galactic equator. Press 'F5' to scroll
   through the 3 levels of display.

                             Messier  Objects

        There are two levels of display for the Messier Objects. The
   most interesting 16 objects, as chosen by me, show up first when
   'F4' is pressed. One more 'F4' turns on display of all the objects.
   Unfortunately, the labels tend to crowd each other at low zoom
   levels. Use the list at the end to learn the names of the objects.


                                   -6-


                             Moving  Around

        SkyGlobe provides many convenient methods for rapidly changing
   the sky view. The up and down arrow keys change the View Elevation
   by 5 degrees. The right and left arrow keys work with the View
   Direction. When the View Elevation is near the Horizon these keys
   work about as you expect, but nearer to the Zenith they rotate the
   view more than they move it. This is correct when you remember that
   the View Direction stands for where your feet are pointing. PgUp and
   PgDn change Elevation in multiple jumps, while Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-
   Right do the same for Direction. The End key jumps you directly to
   the Horizon, and the Home key goes to the Zenith. Finally, you can
   change the View Direction instantly to compass points by pressing
   'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W'.



                          What  Do  We  See?

        Lots and lots of stars! You can change the number of stars
  displayed by pressing 'B' for Brightness to increase the number, or
  'Shift-B' to decrease it. The table below shows the correspondence
  between the Brightness Index and the number displayed.

            1-200     5-350     9-750     13-3000    17-15000
            2-225     6-400    10-1000    14-4000    18-25000
            3-250     7-500    11-1500    15-5000
            4-300     8-600    12-2000    16-7000

        SkyGlobe allows you to adjust the magnification of your sky
   view. At a nominal magnification of 1, half of the celestial sphere
   is visible. Since the eye can focus on far less area than this, a
   certain amount of distortion is evident at low magnifications. Still,
   you can use these views to quickly find areas of interest. The center
   of the screen is always the most accurate portion. Use 'Z' to increase
   the magnification and 'Shift-Z' to decrease it. The table shows the
   correspondence between the Zoom Index and the magnification.

            1-1.00    5-1.20    9-1.60    13-2.25

                               The  Planets

        You can use SkyGlobe to learn something about the way the
   planets move around the Sun. The very word 'Planet' is derived from
   the Greek word for wanderer. The ancients, who spent more time out-
   of-doors than we do, noticed that a few bright 'stars' seemed to
   move against the 'fixed' background of the rest of the heavens.
   (Here I mean fixed with respect to each other; they were acquainted
   with the slow progression from one season to the next of the whole
   'sphere'.) They soon worked out the repetitive patterns the diff-
   erent 'stars' followed. We will learn how to simulate this motion
   shortly, but first we need to talk about some SkyGlobe features that
   are relevant.
        Although the stars don't really change from one year to the next,
   the planets do. Notice the year displayed on the Date display in the
   upper left-hand corner. If this Time and Date are not displayed, press
   'F2' to turn this display on. Use 'Y' or 'Sh-Y' to increase or decrease
   the year. Make sure the current directory contains the .DAT files for
   the years you wish to view. (More planet data is available from Klassm
   Software for $5 a disk. 5 1/4 disks hold 17 years, 3 1/2 disks twice as
   as many. Please specify the years you wish.) If the proper data is
   available, you should be able to see the planets. You can use 'F3' to
   turn on the planet display, and to turn on planet labels. EGA/VGA
   color users see the planets in more or less appropriate colors. You
   may need to change the Time or Date to see your favorite planet.
        Now that we have seen the planets, let's see how they move. Change
   the Viewing Direction to South and the Time to 12:00 noon. Turn off
   Daylight Time by pressing 'V'. Set Auto-Increment Type to Date by
   pressing 'Alt-A' if needed. Now press 'A' and watch the show. Try
   speeding things up by pressing 'Alt-F1' and 'Alt-B'. Press 'F5' to
   see the how the planets stick near the Ecliptic. Since your location
   may not fall exactly on the Standard Time meridian, the Sun may not
   be due South for you at Civil noon. Also notice how it wanders from
   side to side throughout the year.
        Notice how Mercury and Venus stay close to the Sun. Mars has
   positively weird behavior, since it is outside the Earth's orbit, but
   relatively close by. It also has an eccentric orbit. The other outside
   planets drift more slowly against the background of the stars. You
   may see more clearly how the moon goes through its phases, being al-
   ways in New Moon phase when near the Sun. Move to Midnight, and the
   Moon will be in Full phase when it shows up in the South. Since the
   orbit of the Moon is inclined at about 5 degrees to the ecliptic, it
   wanders above and below it each month. This motion, which rotates
   through an 18 year cycle, accounts for the periodicity of eclipses.
   V2.5 of SkyGlobe uses interpolation to give more accuracy to the
   plotted planet positions. For instance, take a look at the solar
   eclipse of July 11, 1991. Slowly step through the hours, and watch how
   the moon gradually overtakes the Sun. This interpolation is disabled
   for the first and last days of the year, and leap day is not observed.
   Still, it is fun to look for events such as the eclipse, or the close
   conjunction of Mars, Jupiter, and Venus on June 17, 1991. Pluto, since
   it is invisible to even large binoculars, is plotted for only 4 positions
   a year.

                              Keeping Track

        SkyGlobe has two handy on-screen displays to help the user. The
   left-hand display will help you keep track of settings such as the
   Zoom Index, and will remind you of the Viewing Location. By pressing
   'F2' you can see the Auto-Increment parameters. If you press 'F2' again
   the final settings screen will display Print parameters and other
   miscellaneous information. This display can be blanked by pressing
   'F2' yet again, or use 'Shift-F2' to peel off one screen at a time.
        A Help screen appears on the right-hand side of the screen. This
   display will remind you of the single-key commands of SkyGlobe. Press
   'F1', and the function key assignments appear. One more 'F1', and the
   display vanishes. Pressing ESC will display all available help sections.



                           What  Is  A  Toggle?

        Many of the display features in SkyGlobe can be instantly
   turned off or turned back on by pressing a single function key.
   A list follows.

    F6-Ecliptic line dots           F8-Horizon, Elevation and Zenith
    F7-Right Ascension/Declination  F9-Constellation Names and Star Labels
       coordinate line dots         F10-Constellation Lines

        Using Alt along with the function keys provides for several
   useful short-cuts and special features. To reduce the display to
   stars and constellation line, press 'Alt-F1'. Stars alone can be
   displayed with 'Alt-F2'. To maximize display elements with one
   keypress, try 'Alt-F3', and watch the sky become crowded. Color
   users can switch the background color and constellation line star
   color with 'Alt-F4' and 'Alt-F5', respectively.
        SkyGlobe allows you to artificially brighten the stars that
   make up the constellation lines by pressing 'Alt-F10'. This conforms
   to the same groupings as the lines themselves, so you may need to
   press the key enough times to pass the number of lines displayed.
   Use 'Alt-Shift-F10' to reduce this Cheat Index.
        To save time in paring down the display, you may use the 'Alt'
   key in conjunction with several letter-key commands to reduce the
   chosen parameter to the minimum. Try this with 'Space' for lines
   or 'Z' to Zoom all the way out. Also supported are 'B', 'L', and 'C'.
        We haven't yet discussed a few features mentioned in the above
   function key list. SkyGlobe can display Right Ascension, Declination
   and Ecliptic lines to help you orient yourself on the celestial sphere.
   Notice how the Ecliptic passes through the constellations of the
   Zodiac, and how Orion lies right across the celestial equator. Try
   looking north with Auto-Increment mode on. Watch how the sphere
   appears to rotate, and how Polaris, very near the celestial pole,
   seems almost motionless.

                  Finding  Stars  And  Constellations

        The 'O' and number keys provide a useful feature. Pressing
   'O' enters the Object find mode. The top line of the display tells
   us that we can ask SkyGlobe to find either Sirius or Andromeda.
   If you press Enter at this point, SkyGlobe will attempt to find
   the best Spot to display Sirius. The current Time and Date will
   be used for this find attempt. The display will shift to place
   Sirius as close to the center of the screen as possible. If Sirius
   is visible in this view, it will be labelled with its full name on
   the screen. Even if Sirius is not visible in this view, the display
   will shift to get to the closest Spot.
        It is also possible to choose the best Time or Date for the
   current viewing Direction and Elevation. If we had pressed 'S'
   instead of Enter before, the effect would have been the same. To
   choose the best Time to see Sirius, without changing the View, we
   would have pressed 'Shift-S'. 'Alt-S' will give us the best Date
   for the current Direction and Elevation.
        The same choices will work for all the 300 named stars. Just
   use the cursor keys to pick the star you wish to find, and use
   Enter, 'S', 'Shift-S', or 'Alt-S' as before. For constellations
   instead of stars, just use 'C', 'Shift-C', and 'Alt-C'. For example,
   press 'O' to enter the Object find routine, and press 'Shift-C'.
   Andromeda will appear at the center of the screen, and the Time
   will have changed to the best choice for our current View.
        Alternatively, you could enter the number directly. The
   proper numbers for the stars and constellations can be found on the
   Handy SkyGlobe Reference Card, but since this is an unregistered
   copy of SkyGlobe, use the list at the end of this file. It is often
   best to change the View Direction to south before searching for the
   best Time or Date to view objects. If an object is not visible, try
   changing the Time or Date if searching by Spot, or changing the View
   Direction or Elevation if by Time or Date.

        I would like to say a few words here about nomenclature. The
   names of the constellations are well standardized. Many of the
   strange names in the southern sky are Latinized names of scientific
   implements, since these constellations were named, (by the Western
   world, that is), in the beginning of the Industrial Age. Most of the
   northern constellation names go back much further. We use the genitive,
   or possessive, form of the constellation name to denote star names.
   For example, Alpha Centauri means the first star of Centaurus. The
   stars were generally enumerated in order of brightness. Since star
   brightnesses change with time, this correlation is not always exact.
   Many stars also have popular names, which are not standardized nearly
   as well as constellations. Most of the names are Arabic in origin.
   This reflects the fact that the Arabic world maintained and developed
   astronomical knowledge while Europe was struggling through the Dark
   Ages. You may want to take my lists with a grain of salt. Fifty-seven
   stars have been chosen for celestial navigation purposes by the various
   authorities, and labels for these stars appear in a different color
   in EGA and VGA color modes.

                      Changing  Viewing  Locations

        One of the most popular pastimes for new astronomers is seeing
   what the sky looks like from other places. Perhaps you're thinking
   of moving, and want to make sure the stars will still be interesting
   to view from your prospective new home. (They will be!) Rather than
   quitting the program and choosing a different location from the menu,
   simply press 'G'. Once you make your new choice you will return to
   the program with all your other parameters just the way you left them.
   Since SkyGlobe 2.5 now has twice as many locations, there are two
   pages of locations to choose from. Use the 'End' key to quickly go
   to the spot that changes between pages.
        If you wish to move a small amount in a compass direction, try
   'Alt-N', 'Alt-S', 'Alt-E' or 'Alt-W'. Then you can change locations
   without ever taking your eyes off the current display. The east and
   west moves simply have the effect of changing the local time by 1
   minute. The north-south changes are 1/4 degree, about 17 miles. You
   may instantly change your location between the North and South Hemi-
   spheres by pressing 'Alt-F' to Flip between the two. When you make
   any of these choices, the city name will have its first character
   Xed out, to remind you that it will no longer be accurate.

        Use of the 'K' key allows for the saving of current program
   settings. Up to 11 different settings may be saved, since you will be
   prompted to press Enter or one of digits 0-9. These keys will create
   the file SKYGLOBE.KFG, or SKYGLOBE.KF#, where # is a digit 0 through 9.
   When SkyGlobe is started, it looks for the .KFG file to get its initial
   settings. If you would rather use the default settings, start the program
   with SKYGLOBE/N. If you want to use one of the other files, just use
   SKYGLOBE/#, such as SKYGLOBE/4 to use SKYGLOBE.KF4. This scheme allows
   for the use of batch files, such as ECLIPSE.BAT=SKYGLOBE/0, where
   SKYGLOBE.KF0 has been set up for July 11, 1991. Program settings saved
   include such things as Zoom Index, Brightness Index, etc., as well as
   location and Time and Date. Thus, you could create a file for your date,
   time, and place of birth, if your birthplace is on the menu. As a tip,
   use 'A' and 'R' to quickly get back to current time, if you have loaded
   a .KFG file, and wish to use the settings, but not the old time and date.
   Use 'I' to reset the program to the way it would start up if you used
   SKYGLOBE/N.

        If you decide to register your copy of SkyGlobe 2.5, it will come
   with a customized SKYGLOBE.REG file. This file will contain your name,
   registration number, and date of registration, as well as your desired
   Home Town, and up to two other locations. These locations will replace
   the two Caledonias and the Roscommon on the location menu, but as a
   registered user you won't even need to bother with the location menu.
   SkyGlobe will automatically start up with your Home Town, and use the
   video adapter choice you made when you sent in your registration. Thus,
   all you will need to do is type 'SKYGLOBE', and the program will start
   displaying the stars! If you specify other viewing locations, you will
   be able to access them from the 'G' command and the location menu. If
   you move, you will be able to edit these locations yourself. Since regis-
   tration is only $15, what are you waiting for? You might even receive a
   newer version of the program! 
                                   -11-

                           Printing The Screen

        Since VGA monitors can be a bit cumbersome to carry to a star-
   watching party, or even into your back yard, SkyGlobe allows you to
   print the contents of the screen. Those of you with dot-matrix printers
   can obtain printouts by using 'P', 'Shift-P' and 'Alt-P'. The first two
   of these are landscape views, the last is a portrait display. If there
   are problems with printing, such as double-spacing, you may need to
   change the Print Parameters. Use 'F2' to view the current settings, then
   use 'Alt-Shift-P' to roll through the different combinations until you
   get one that works for you. Pressing any key during printing stops the
   process, although most printers have buffers that will hold several lines.
        SkyGlobe 2.5 now supports LaserJet-compatible laser printers.
   The program defaults to dot-matrix printing, so the first thing to
   do is to change to laser printing. Make certain you can see the
   print parameters on the left-hand side of the screen. Press 'F2' if
   you need to display more parameters. The print parameters are near
   the bottom of the left-hand display, when they are all turned on.
   When you can see the parameters, use 'Alt-Shift-P' to scroll through
   the different combinations of settings. Don't stop just because it
   says Laser, you need to have the proper combination of ports and
   Line Feed settings as well. For most systems, this means Laser, Add
   Line Feeds, and LPT1. When you get the proper combination of settings,
   you are ready to print. 'P', 'Shift-P', and 'Alt-P' will all give a
   landscape screen shot. The Laser and other print parameter settings
   are included in the configuration file created by the 'K' command,
   so you can make the change once, and have it apply for the future.
   Registered users can specify that they have a laser printer on their
   order forms, and this will make laser printing the default for them.
   If you register now and get a laser printer later, you will be able
   to change this default setting yourself.


                               Tidbits

        For users with telescopes that produce a reversed image, you
   can press 'X' to force SkyGlobe to similarly reverse the display.
        To return all program settings to their defaults, press 'I'.
        Finally, press 'Q' to return to DOS.


                      Thanks  For  Your  Support!

        I hope you enjoy SkyGlobe! Even if do not decide to become a fully
   registered user, you are encouraged to please pass it on to anyone who
   may find it interesting. Registered Users will automatically hear about
   future updates. The next update is (very) tentatively scheduled for mid-
   1991, and should include SuperVGA support, more deep-space objects, mouse
   support and point and shoot capabilities, and high-resolution printing.
   The user will have more control over color selection and the like, and
   I also plan to add some celestial navigation features. Lines such as the
   Milky Way and constellation lines will always extend to the edge of the
   screen, and VGA mode might even be faster, at least for complex displays.
   Any suggestions you may have will be greatly appreciated. I can be reached
   on CompuServe as 76207,3377, or in care of the address on the order form.

        Thanks, and have fun learning about the stars!

             SkyGlobe and the Stars - Some Background Information

             Why do we see different stars at different times? The
        Earth makes one complete rotation every day. If there were no 
        Sun we could see that the stars appear to make one complete 
        revolution at the same time. The North Star, Polaris (#51), is 
        almost directly above the North Pole on the Earth's axis of 
        rotation. So the stars near the North Star (about halfway up 
        the northern sky in mid-northern latitudes) make tiny little 
        circles every day. Farther away from the North Star the stars 
        and the constellations they form wheel across the sky in huge 
        arcs before they disappear below the horizon.


             Why do we see different stars at different dates? Imagine 
        midnight in April. The Sun is behind the Earth, and you are 
        facing away from it if you face due south. Now imagine 
        midnight in October, six months later. You are still facing 
        away from the Sun. But because the Earth has moved halfway 
        around the Sun in its yearly orbit, you are looking in exactly 
        the opposite direction to the one you were in April. So 
        different stars are visible at midnight, and the ones near the 
        North Star have made half a revolution. If there were no Sun, 
        you could see that at noon the October sky is the same as the
        midnight sky in April.


             Before Standard Time Zones were instituted, the Sun was 
        due south at noon everywhere. That was what noon meant. Now 
        that is true only if you happen to live near the center of the 
        time zone. If you live in Michigan, the Sun is due south
        around 12:30 or so. In New York City, which is in the same 
        time zone, the Sun reaches due south a few minutes before 
        noon, over a half hour earlier than in Michigan. The Sun reaches
        due south somewhat later in Chicago than in Michigan, but be-
        cause Chicago is in the Central time zone this occurs before
        12:00PM. This has to be allowed for to make the display correct,
        and is unique to each location. Daylight Saving Time is handled
        in a similar manner, and is indicated on the Time Display by an
        upper case 'AM' or 'PM'.


             The sky can be viewed as a sphere with the Earth at the 
        center, and the stars as fixed points on the sphere. Any 
        attempt to represent this 3-dimensional space on a 2-dimen-
        sional surface inevitably introduces some distortion. SkyGlobe
        uses a stereographic projection that can be calculated very
        rapidly and is quite accurate at the center of the screen. Al-
        though the edges of the screen suffer significant distortion,
        SkyGlobe is so fast that any desired view can be located
        almost instantly. The illusion that the stars form a sphere 
        with the viewer on the outside is a result of the projection, 
        and it is just that, an illusion.

                           Background Continued

             Another issue that must be dealt with is double stars. 
        Perhaps as many as half of all stars are actually multiple 
        star systems. The naked eye frequently interprets two dim 
        stars close together as one brighter star. Many 'stars' that 
        serve as end-points on constellation lines fit into this 
        category. If these stars were left dim and separate they would 
        appear 'invisible' at low brightnesses and make constellation 
        shapes unrecognizable. At higher brightnesses and low magnif-
        ications these stars would be plotted on top of one another as 
        points, still artificially dim. The solution is to combine 
        magnitudes for these stars. The ordering of stars in SkyGlobe
        reflects this combination, so at medium brightnesses and 
        magnifications the display is as realistic as possible. The 
        dimmer star is retained at its actual brightness, so at very 
        high magnifications and brightnesses you will see one 
        artificially bright star and one accurate dim star.

             SkyGlobe contains coordinates for 7000 stars in the file
        SKYGLOBE.DAT. This represents all the stars visible to the
        naked eye. These coordinates were obtained from Sky Catalogue
        2000.0 with permission from the publisher, Sky Publishing
        Corp. This permission is gratefully appreciated. The files
        SKY8000.DAT and SKY10000.DAT contain another 8000 and 10000
        stars, respectively. SKY8000.DAT is included with the unreg-
        istered program, while SKY10000.DAT is added for registered
        users. This is not 'Crippleware', since the operation of the
        program is identical for both, but an attempt to keep the un-
        registered program to one 360K disk.

             SkyGlobe was programmed entirely in assembly language for
        maximum speed. As much processing as possible was done before-
        hand and the results placed in tables. Since there is necessarily
        a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, the precision of the star
        coordinates was carefully matched to the resolution of the graph-
        ics display and the projection algorithm chosen. The code was
        hand-optimized for speed, without regard for size or ugliness.
        Of course, no program is perfect. Any suggestions or bug reports
        would be greatly appreciated.

                     Some Frequently Asked Questions

        How can I speed up SkyGlobe?

            There are really two answers to this question. SkyGlobe
        always does what you ask it to do as fast as it can. (We think
        it's pretty fast!) The trick is to ask it to do things in a
        way that seems faster.
            The first method involves asking SkyGlobe to do less work.
        The easiest way is to turn off the Help Menu by pressing 'F1'.
        Then turn off everything else you can do without: ecliptic, 
        right ascension and declination lines; extra constellation
        lines; dim stars.
            The second method applies only to Auto-Increment mode. 
        SkyGlobe starts off changing the view five minutes at a time.
        You can increase this rate by pressing 'F'. Another way is
        to change the increment type to Date mode by pressing 'Alt-A',
        Then increase the Date increment rate by pressing 'F'.

        Why doesn't Caps Lock have any effect?

            To avoid confusion it was decided to ignore Caps Lock.

        Why doesn't the Shift-key always work?

            This applies only to Shift-SPACE and Shift-Alt functions.
        For those keys the computer only checks the Shift condition 
        when the SPACE or Alt-letter key is finally processed. If you 
        let up on the Shift key before the computer is ready to 
        process the SPACE or Alt-letter key, the Shift state you had
        intended goes un-noticed. So you end up adding constellation 
        lines that you just deleted. Either hold the Shift key down 
        for a while on multiple Shift-SPACES, or use 'F10' to kill all
        constellation lines at once. This method leaves the line
        display index unchanged, so a subsequent 'F10' will display
        the same number of lines. To reset the line display index to
        zero immediately, press 'Alt-Space'.

        Why doesn't anything happen when I press 'V'?
         
            Either the date is not appropriate for Daylight Saving 
        Time, or you chose a location that does not use it.

        I get lots of blank pages and garbage on my laser printer.

            SkyGlobe 2.5 defaults to dot-matrix printing. To change to
        laser printing, press 'Alt-Shift-P' until the print parameters
        reflect your system. This will probably be: Laser, Add Line
        Feeds, LPT1. Use 'F2' until you see the choices on the left-
        hand side of the screen, near the end of the display.

        There are blank lines when I try to print.

            Your printer adds line feeds when it receives a carriage
        return character. Use 'F2' to display the Print Parameters.
        Then press 'Alt-Sh-P' to change to 'No Line Feeds'.

        How can I make SkyGlobe use the minimum amount of memory?

           REName or DELete the file SKY8000.DAT, and use EGA
        graphics. You will still be able to display 7000 stars and
        the planets. CGA and VGA graphics both require extra memory.

        My location is not near a choice on the location menu.

           You can make your city or town the default choice on the 
        location menu by obtaining a registered copy of SkyGlobe. If
        you wish to obtain a registered copy of the latest version of
        SkyGlobe, send $15 to:

SkyGlobe 2.5 is very fun and simple to use!

To run SkyGlobe 2.5, make sure the files SKYGLOBE.COM and SKYGLOBE.DAT are
present in the currently active directory, (the one that lists when you type
DIR). Then, just type SKYGLOBE, and press Enter.

First you will be asked to select a video adapter. If you have a color system,
you will be able to choose between CGA, EGA, and VGA. The CGA display will be
in black and white, while EGA and VGA will be in full 16-color mode. If you
have a monochrome system, the menu will include Hercules, EGA monochrome, and
VGA monochrome. If your system supports gray-scaling, SkyGlobe will probably
use the color choices. Use the cursor keys to select the proper choice for your
system, and press Enter.

The next task is to select a viewing location. The nearly 240 choices are on
two pages, with the first page containing US and Canadian locations. To see
the international choices, use the End key, then press Enter. Use the cursor
keys to select the desired location, then press Enter.

Read the Shareware message, then press any key. The screen will be filled with
stars!!

Try the simple one-key commands and have fun with SkyGlobe 2.5!!!

     Most problems with SkyGlobe 2.5 can be solved with a careful reading of
the documentation, contained in the file SKYGLOBE.DOC. To print this file, use
the DOS command COPY SKYGLOBE.DOC PRN. You can also import it as ASCII text
into any word processor, but you might have to reset your margins.
     If you have a laser printer, you will have to change the type of printer
from dot-matrix to laser. Use 'Alt-Shift-P' to do this, and use 'F2' to watch
what you are doing. More detailed instructions are in the documentation.
     Because of the low resolution of the multi-color modes of the CGA graphics
adapter, the CGA display is in black and white. The 16-color mode offered by
some Tandy computers is not supported by SkyGlobe 2.5. If you are unsure if
your computer has EGA or VGA graphics, nothing bad will happen if you try them.
If your computer doesn't support the video choice you make, there will be no
star display, but you should be able return to DOS by pressing 'Q'.
     If the planets are not displayed, make sure the appropriate .DAT file for
the year you are viewing is in the same directory as SKYGLOBE.COM. If you have
removed the floppy disk, replace it and press Enter to reload the planet data.
     Daylight Saving Time causes a few problems. SkyGlobe assumes that April 4
is the first day of Daylight Time, and October 27 is the last. (Northern Hemi-
sphere) This approximates the current US policy of first Sunday in April, last
Sunday in Oct., but will still be off by a day or two most years. You can use
'V' to shut it off, but there is no way to force Daylight Time. If the display
jumps unexpectedly in Auto mode, Daylight Saving Time is usually the reason.
     Finally, Real-Time mode will keep you from changing the Time and Date.
