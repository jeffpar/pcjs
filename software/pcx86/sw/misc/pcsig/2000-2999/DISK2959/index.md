Author Registration: $95.00                                             
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, graphics card, hard drive, DOS 3.3+, and
                                                                        
EASY*GEN allows you to easily design a customized and fully computerized
employee attitude survey using a database of over 500 questions covering
41 topics. Your own questions (both multiple-choice quantitative and    
open-ended qualitative) and topics, introductory text, and demographic  
questions can be included as well.                                      
                                                                        
The surveys, which are designed by you, can be conducted interactively  
on a PC or with questionnaires. Custom reports and graphs with trend    
analysis and breakdowns by demographic categories can be produced.      
                                                                        
EASY*GEN can also be used to computerize your organization's existing   
surveys or to develop other types of surveys (Employee Attitudes,       
Training Needs Assessment, etc.).
