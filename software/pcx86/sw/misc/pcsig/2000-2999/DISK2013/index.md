## Information about "KAKA!"

    Roll six die in competition to remain the highest scoring player in the
    game.  Two to six players take turns to roll "scorable" combinations of
    numbers.  Once a player's turn begins, play continues until the player
    chooses to quit and take the turn's score or until KAKA! is rolled -- a
    non-scoring roll of the dice.  Directions are provided online and
    context-sensitive help is a keystroke away.
