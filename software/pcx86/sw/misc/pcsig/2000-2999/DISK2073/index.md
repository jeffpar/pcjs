## Information about "HOME MAINTENANCE & REPAIR 2 OF 2 (2072)"

    Don't you just hate it when you have to call a repairman but you think
    he may take advantage of you?  Wouldn't it be nice to have some
    basic knowledge of your home and auto systems just so that you could ask
    the right questions and at least sound like you know what you're talking
    about?   If you don't happen to have a brother-in-law to double-check
    with, you can learn basic home and automotive maintenance and trouble
    shooting techniques from HOME MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
    
    HOME MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR has maintenance tutorials and trouble
    shooting charts for air conditioning, home electrical systems, heating,
    plumbing, appliances and automobiles.  HOME MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR gives
    you tool lists, illustrations, and schematics of the systems. It allows
    you to print maintenance forms.  It offers step-by-step support for
    doing regular maintenance on your home and car -- the simple kinds of
    tasks that help to keep those expensive repairmen away from your door.
    And when something does go wrong, look to HOME MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR's
    trouble shooting charts for a suggestion of what the problem is and what
    you should do about it.  In both the trouble shooting guides and the
    general maintenance tutorials, HOME MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR takes special
    care to alert you to all dangers, gives cautions and advice on working
    safely, and lets you know when it's time to call in a professional.
    
    Depending upon your interest and skill level, HOME MAINTENANCE AND
    REPAIR can be a beginner's tutorial and guide book for dealing with
    mechanics and repairmen, or a ready guide for hands-on maintenance and
    repair.  If you are among the thousands of people who don't really
    understand much about plumbing, wiring, how your furnace works, or just
    what you're supposed to do to keep your car in good condition, HOME
    MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR does.
