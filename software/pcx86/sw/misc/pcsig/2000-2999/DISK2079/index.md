## Information about "PC-SPORT"

    You have just been awarded the position of sports director at your local
    club and your first responsibility is the club's annual all-county table
    tennis tournament.  Twenty members from seven clubs will be arriving and
    it's your job to figure who plays who and when.  The local sport store
    has never heard of table tennis statistic books and no one in your club
    knows anything about producing player charts.  What do you do?
    
    You call on PC-SPORT.  In one easy-to-use program, PC-SPORT takes
    information on your club or organization, the type of sport activity you
    will be dealing with, the number of players involved, their names and
    their organizations, etc., and prepares a database entry screen for
    statistic recording.  PC-SPORT will also help you prepare those round
    robin, or ladder-style play charts.  PC-SPORT is the sports directors'
    assistant.
