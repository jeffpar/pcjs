             WELCOME TO VGA JIGSAW PUZZLE   1.5     24-MAY-1990

   This README file contains important, last minute information in
   addition to VJIG.DOC . It also answers many common questions.

                       ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

   A) VGA :  This program requires  IBM  AT or  compatible, VGA  graphics
      display  and 384 K  of memory.  It supports  the  most  popular VGA
      cards.  If your card  is not  included in the  "VGA CARD SELECTION"
      menu you have 2 options:  (1)  Contact  your VGA card manufacturer,
      and ask what other VGA  card is yours  COMPATIBLE with.  Or (2) Just
      try all selections from the "VGA CARD SELECTION LIST" until you find
      one that works.

   B) Program files VJIG.EXE,  files with .GL and  .LST extension must  be
      present in the current  directory for the  program to work correctly.

   C) MOUSE : if you plan to use the mouse, the mouse driver must be loaded
      before running VJIG. For best results,  your mouse driver should be a
      recent update, 1988 or later.  If you have any problem with the mouse
      due to compatibility issues just select  the keyboard option from the
      installation menu.

   D) SPECIAL NOTES FOR REGISTERED VERSION:  PCX or GIF files  must be in the
      320 X 200 X 256 color mode.  PCX files must be compatible with a recent
      version of PC-PAINTBRUSH.  For some of your  PCX or GIF files you  may
      have to turn your  monitor  brightness knob all  the way up for better
      visibility.  Please  note that PCX files  occupy more disk memory than
      GIF files but they load on the screen much faster.

                             UPDATE HISTORY
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
