Disk Title: Grading Assistant 2 of 2 (also 1632)                        
PC-SIG Version: S4.0

Special Requirements: 640K RAM and  2 floppies or a hard drive.         
                                                                        
Here's some quality help for harried teachers.  GRADING ASSISTANT churns
out student grades throughout the grading period with a minimum of      
effort and study.  The well crafted menus let computer-wise teachers    
skip most of the manual and plunge into program installation.  To aid in
tracking, GRADING ASSISTANT produces a bonanza of student and class     
average reports.                                                        
                                                                        
Teachers can use up to 12 grade categories such as work, homework,      
projects, tests and quizzes for each class.  Different weights can be   
assigned to each category, but categories and weights can be changed at 
any time.                                                               
                                                                        
Compute both numeric and letter grade averages.  You define your own    
match of numeric grades to letter grades with pluses and minuses.  You  
can automatically drop the lowest score for each student in a class for 
a particular grade category.                                            
                                                                        
A thunderstorm of reports awaits the number conscious teacher.  You get 
current grade average reports for each student in each class. You can   
get student averages for up to 12 different categories of grades per    
class.  You also get the class grade distribution counts by letter      
grade.                                                                  
                                                                        
An interim grade report lets you produce a listing for each student     
whose average is below a cut-off numeric grade.  This helps the teacher 
notify both parent and child that things need changing.  The class      
roster is handy for taking attendance or manually recording select      
grades.  You get year-to-date grade average reports by student and by   
class and the overall average for each of the past grading periods of   
the school year.  Then you get an overall school year average for each  
student in each class.  You can compute a yearly class grade average at 
the end of the school year.                                             
                                                                        
A special subprogram lets a teacher display current grade averages or   
grade averages from previous grading periods as a simple bar graph.     
And, another included program file lets teachers maintain a file of each
student's address and telephone number.
