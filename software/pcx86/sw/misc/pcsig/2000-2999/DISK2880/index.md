Disk Title: Quatris II                                                  
PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: QUATRIS II                                               
Author Version: 1.0D                                                    
Author Registration: $16.00 + $4.75 shipping                            
Special Requirements: 640k RAM and EGA/VGA card.                        
                                                                        
The ultimate brain game? You be the judge. This tetris-like game is very
easy to operate and play while at the same time exercising your brain to
visualize and measure objects and space. If you know Tetris, QUATRIS II 
shouldn't be any problem for you.                                       
                                                                        
This game has 3 complete levels and 40 extended shapes to play with.    
QUATRIS II supports 16 color, high resolution EGA/VGA graphics mode     
using 3D graphical-user-interface, and now works under QEMM. It will    
automatically save your game, allow you to redefine your keys, track    
both your score and the number of lines left, and is provided with a    
grid to help you more accurately drop the blocks. A unique feature that 
can improve your score by giving you another chance is the ability to   
enlist bombs that will either wipe out a line, wipe out particular      
pieces, or wipe out everything on the screen, provided you have enough  
"energy." Challenge of the playing field changes from level to level    
with the fluxuation of the two-dimensional "well" where the blocks fall.
                                                                        
The shareware version of QUATRIS II has only 3 levels of play, yet many 
people find (and we tend to agree) that even in this form it provides   
you with more fun and addiction than Tetris or any of the other         
tetris-like programs.

I've liked or used enough to register!)"
