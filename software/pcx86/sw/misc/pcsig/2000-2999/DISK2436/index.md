## Information about "FRAC"

    If you think twisting, moving, and dropping different shaped blocks to
    form solid lines is fun, then FRAC, a new 3-D  TETRIS-like program, will
    drive you completely over the edge.
    
    The object of FRAC is deceptively simple.  Pack falling blocks into
    solid layers as quickly and efficiently as possible.  However, in FRAC
    you have to contend with not only moving and twisting the falling
    blocks, but also shifting them in space in order to place them in empty
    spaces on the 3-dimensional grid. If it sounds difficult, it is. The
    first couple of layers are relatively easy to complete, but with more
    than three layers, placing the many differently-shaped blocks can be a
    nerve-wracking fun experience.
    
    If you've grown tired of 2-dimensional dropping-block games, enter the
    3-D FRAC zone.  Watch out for the huge 3x3x3 cube.  It's the hardest
    shape to place.
