## Information about "MATCH & LOGIC GAMES FOR KIDS"

    MATH AND LOGIC GAMES FOR KIDS presents six programs that challenge a
    child's mathematics and thinking skills. The programs are aimed at
    grade levels K-6, but can be enjoyed by all.
    
    TARGET MATH and JELLY BEANS are competitions between two players, or
    one player versus the computer. In TARGET MATH, take turns adding
    numbers trying to reach a target sum. In JELLY BEANS, take turns
    removing beans from a jar. (The one who takes the last bean loses!)
    
    I SHOT AN ARROW is a simple simulation of an arrow flying through the
    air until the program introduces estimation and answer refinement
    skills. LEAKY TUB simulates filling a leaky bath tub with hot and cold
    water, and is just plain fun while teaching logical thinking. In MATH
    RACE, up to four players take turns answering arithmetic flash card
    problems. The faster you answer your problem, the further down the
    track your car travels. Each player can race at a skill level
    pretty pictures using the ideas of Fractal math.
