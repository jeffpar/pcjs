## Information about "ACTIVE LIFE FOR MS-DOS DISK 2OF2 (2021)"

    Think a computer is too much hassle to replace your DayTimer?  Or maybe
    your current appointment calendar doesn't have the strength you need?
    ACTIVE LIFE is an extremely powerful system for planning, managing, and
    tracking one's active business and personal life that takes advantage of
    your mouse (though a mouse is not required).
    
    The flexible schedules manage workflow effectively and all types of
    recurring activities need be entered just once.  Plus, the ACTIVE LIFE
    Notebook provides an indexed text/graphics database manager featuring
    telephone auto-dial. ACTIVE LIFE also includes pop-up calendars, alarms,
    and week-at-a-glance.  Printed schedules provide reference and notation.
    
    This DOS version uses a look-alike windows format.  While you can use
    ACTIVE LIFE with only a keyboard, a mouse is highly recommended.
