## Information about "HOUSEHOLD REGISTER"

    Wouldn't it be great if you had a complete inventory list of all your
    household items?  HOUSEHOLD REGISTER gives you just that.  It
    maintains a detailed list of your household possessions.  Each
    inventory item is automatically stored by location, category, and
    owner.  The pop-up menus can be easily customized for the location (24
    selections), category (24 selections), and owner (8 selections)
    fields.  And these menus can be turned off, if desired, and entries
    made by typing data directly into the three fields rather than making
    selections from a menu.
    
    Each inventory database can contain 99,999 items and there can be an
    unlimited number of databases.  On-screen help is available for each
    screen and help lines are automatically displayed for each data entry
    field.
    
    HOUSEHOLD REGISTER provides printed reports that can be sent to the
    screen, printer, or a disk text file.  Inventory records can be
    printed
    on 3 x 5 index cards or on Rolodex cards.  A detailed summary report
    can be printed showing the number and value of items by
    location, category, or owner.  A warranty list can be printed
    showing the warranty expiration date for all warranteed intems.
