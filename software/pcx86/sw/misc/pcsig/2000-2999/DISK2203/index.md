## Information about "QUESTOR 2 OF 2 (2202 ALSO)"

    With QUESTOR, you can enter, edit, and catalog up to 2 billion videos --
    you're only limited by the space available on your hard or floppy disk.
    For each video entry, there is a field for title, actor(s), rating (G,
    PG, R), category, year, location, and five star rating. There's even a
    notepad field that gives you plenty of room to give a Siskel & Ebert
    type overview of the video.
    
    Once you've entered the info for each video, you can use the Artificial
    Intelligence Language Interpreter to find a specific video!  Talk to
    QUESTOR using ordinary English to tell it what videos to search for and
    display. QUESTOR is an easy-to-use, menu-driven program that has help
    screens at every turn.  You'll never be at a loss as to what to do next.
