## Information about "TIME MASTER AND SECURITY"

    Have you ever wondered how much your computer is used?  Or what it is
    used for?  TIME MASTER answers those questions.
    
    Simply start TIME MASTER each time you start using your computer and
    "log-in."  Then exit TIME MASTER and start using your other application
    programs.  Do your word processing, accounting, etc.  Each time you exit
    an application, enter TIME MASTER and "log-off."  Tell TIME MASTER your
    name, what program you used, and how much time was used for business and
    personal reasons.
    
    At the end of any period (day, week, year, etc.); TIME MASTER will
    display or print out reports that tell you who used what program, how
    long they used it, and how much time was used for business and personal
    reasons.
    
    This program is perfect for any individual who needs to track, for
    taxation puposes, the time their computer is used for business and
    personal tasks.  Also for the company or government department seeking
    management information on the use of their computers.
    
    Now you can protect your computer from unauthorized use.  With SECURITY,
    only you know the password and only you can change it.
    
    SECURITY lets you add password security to your computer through your
    CONFIG.SYS file.  While this is safer than programs that use your
    AUTOEXEC.BAT to add password protection, it will not keep the
    sophisticated hacker out.  However, it is a quick and easy way to keep
    most people off your computer.  Assembly language source code is
    included.
