## Information about "FLAGS"

    Now you can have a display of colorful flags of every independent
    nation in the world (as of 1989), and information about each nation.
    The flags of cities, states, and dependencies are also included.
    
    Enjoy full-color representations of over 250 different flags.  And take
    a "Flag Quiz" to test your knowledge of national flags.  The program can
    also run on its own, displaying each flag briefly.  There are special
    sections which graphically illustrate the history of the British and
    U.S. flags.  And, just for fun, you can change the colors of any of the
    flags.
