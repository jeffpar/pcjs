PC-SIG Version: S5.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: The Complete Sales Automation System                     
Author Version: 5.0A                                                    
Author Registration: $69.00                                             
Special Requirements: 640K RAM and a hard drive.                        
                                                                        
THE COMPLETE SALES AUTOMATION SYSTEM, an inclusive program for salesmen 
and business owners, offers sales-oriented databases in an easy-to-use  
menu-driven interface to track clients, product inventory, vendors and  
orders.  Generate invoices, quotes, and order-detail tickets from       
information obtained and merged from each database.                     
                                                                        
Nice touches include the ability to work with profit margins, and       
discreetly view comments about clients.  The report function prints     
summaries of sales and orders, as well as lists of clients, vendors,    
and products.  Print out unsold quotations to follow up potential       
leads.  THE COMPLETE SALES AUTOMATION SYSTEM is also compatible on many 
network systems: Novell, 3COM, IBM Token Ring, Banyan, LANtastic (read  
only), and PC/MOS.
