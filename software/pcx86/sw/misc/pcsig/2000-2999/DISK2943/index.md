Disk Title: ZGrafWin                                                    
PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: ZGrafWin                                                 
Author Version: 1.8                                                     
Author Registration: $15.00 or $25.00                                   
Special Requirements: Windows 3.0+. VGA and mouse strongly recommended. 
                                                                        
ZGRAFWIN is a Microsoft Windows based graphing package that handles the 
graphing of functions of 1 or 2 variables, y = f(x) or z = f(x,y).  Also
supported are the popular Bar, Pie, line, Area, X/y, Log and Polar      
graphs.  The graphs can be customized in terms of color and scaling.    
                                                                        
ZGRAFWIN can support three kinds of data input.  One is through a       
spreadsheet kind of module that is built in.  Another is by simply      
importing a file of numbers as a data file.  The third is the most      
powerful but also somewhat complex: creating a data file in ZGRAFWIN's  
format.  This file can have all pertinent information about the graph   
such as its type, size, data, scaling etc.  The package is, therefore,  
very flexible and useful.                                               
                                                                        
The output from this package takes advantage of various Windows' GUI    
functions, namely, printing to a pre-defined printer, a PCX file or into
the clipboard for further integration into another Windows application. 
                                                                        
This high level of customization possible with the package makes it an  
attractive alternative to Windows-loving students and professionals in  
business, education, and presentation areas.
