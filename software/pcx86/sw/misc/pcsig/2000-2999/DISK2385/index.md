## Information about "TUTOR DOS 2 OF 4 (2384,2386-2387 ALSO)"

    TUTOR DOS was created by a professional computer instructor to assist
    beginners who are trying to learn DOS. It was written with the novice
    in mind, and starts with the basics of RAM and DOS before moving on to
    topics such as formatting disks, manipulating sub-directories, and
    creating batch files.
    
    TUTOR DOS consists of 21 interactive lessons. Students are able to
    practice their newfound skills as they acquire them. TUTOR DOS will
    recognize a variety of answers to its questions and prompts users with
    hints. Each lesson ends with a short quiz to help students review what
    they have learned. At the end of the program, students take a
    multiple-choice test to evaluate their knowledge. Based on this test,
    TUTOR DOS either recommends lessons for review or rewards the student
    with a custom printed certificate.
