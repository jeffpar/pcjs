PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: ArcMaster                                                
Author Version: 6.11                                                    
Author Registration: $35.00                                             
Special Requirements: PKZIP, ARCA, PAK, LHA, ARC, or ARJ.               
                                                                        
ARCMASTER is a slick program for users who need to manage, view,        
convert, or look into the contents of compressed files.  Files that have
been compressed by special computer programs such as PKZIP, ARCA, PAK,  
LHA, and ARJ, ARC, are all supported by ARCMASTER.                      
                                                                        
It is a complete and detailed archive program interface control system. 
ARCMASTER remembers all of the various command line switches and options
that may be used with archiving programs.  In addition, it is a powerful
and flexible DOS shell to help you maintain and manipulate your DOS     
directory and file structures.                                          
                                                                        
The ARCMASTER interface is about as intuitive as they come.             
                                                                        
Features include:                                                       
                                                                        
~ Full support for either keyboard or mouse                             
                                                                        
~ Point-and-shoot or pull-down menus                                    
                                                                        
~ File selection with scrolling cursor bars                             
                                                                        
~ Directory tree structure for two drives or subdirectories             
                                                                        
~ File tagging                                                          
                                                                        
~ Launch other programs (such as your favorite word processor)          
                                                                        
~ May be operated in the DESKQView and Windows 3.0 environments         
                                                                        
You must have one or more of the compression programs installed in your 
system in order to get the full benefits from ARCMASTER.  Tag a group of
files, use McAfee's SCAN to check them for viruses, keep a running total
of their size, and create new or updated compressed files.  ARCMASTER   
comes with a simple file browser that allows you to list the contents of
archived files, and even print ASCII documents from inside the archive  
file.  This is a great feature when you want to view the documentation  
of a program before you un-archive it.                                  
                                                                        
In addition to the complete archiving systems cited above, ARCMASTER    
supports LZEXE, PKLITE, and DIET, all of which are designed for the     
specific purpose of compressing executable (.EXE) files.
