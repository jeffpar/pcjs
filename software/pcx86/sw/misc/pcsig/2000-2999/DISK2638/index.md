Special Requirements: Hard drive.                                       
                                                                        
MARXMENU is a very powerful menu/job control language with nearly 500   
commands. MARXMENU gives you complete screen control, supports          
conditional menu options, supports math and string functions, lets you  
design professional looking exploding and shadowed windows, and uses no 
RAM! MARXMENU is especially good on networks.                           
                                                                        
This menu is intended for users with enough knowledge to write batch    
files. While it certainly isn't the easiest menu program around,        
MARXMENU might be one of the most powerful.
