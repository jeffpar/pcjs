## Information about "REMIND AND CALENDAR 25"

    A lean and mean date reminder.  Just put REMIND into your
    AUTOEXEC.BAT and always know when a holiday will occur and never
    forget another birthday or anniversary.
    
    Enter "reminder" dates, such as your anniversary, your mother's
    birthday, and doctor's appointment into the program along with the
    number of days that you would like REMIND to start flagging you ahead
    of the event.  Run the program from AUTOEXEC.BAT and each time you turn
    on your computer, the current date will be compared to the
    entries in the data file.  If a date matches, a window will pop out,
    with the important reminder.  If no date matches, the program will
    simply end inconspicuously, letting you proceed with your daily work.
    You may have multiple entries for each date and enter the dates to be
    reminded up to one year in advance of the current date.
    
    This handy perpetual CALENDAR is unique in that it calculates and
    displays important dates and holidays for any given month/year.  The
    holidays should always be accurate, even if they fall on different
    dates year after year.
    
    It's also a historical chronicle of world events.  One can go back in
    time and important world events that happened at that given month in
    history will be displayed (e.g.  December 7, 1941: the Japanese attack
    on Pearl Harbor).  Browse through history, paging through the
    historical calendar.  Speed up the forwarding and backwarding of years
    by pressing the + or - keys and it forwards or backwards the calendar
    10 years at a time.
