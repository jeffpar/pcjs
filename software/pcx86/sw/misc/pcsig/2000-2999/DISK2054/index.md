## Information about "PULLED FROM THE LIBRARY"

    If your business maintains inventory information and could benefit from
    knowing what the best quantity levels are for each part, then INVENTORY
    MASTER (IM) may be your program.
    
    IM allows you to set up your inventory parts by vendor and then to
    indicate quantity discount levels for each item.  IM then calculates for
    each item the optimum quantity to buy and when to buy it.  The formula
    seeks to balance the cost of keeping the item on the shelf against the
    cost of placing numerous orders.
    
    IM is easy to set up and use, although the manual is a must.  It
    explains how to end work sessions and explains numerous terms in clear
    terminology.  IM does not track inventory stock levels but is used to
    determine stock levels that are optimum for the company.  In so doing, a
    company can minimize stock purchasing costs while maximizing profits.
    For those needing such capabilities, INVENTORY MASTER will answer the
    call.
