ACT 4:12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved."

ROM 1:16 I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.

ROM 1:20 For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.

ROM 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

ROM 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

ROM 10:9 That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

ROM 10:10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.

ROM 10:13 for, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."

1TI 3:16 Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in a body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.

1TI 4:1 The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.

1TI 4:3 They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.

1TI 4:4 For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,

1TI 4:15 Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress.

GEN 3:4       "You will not surely die," the serpent said to the woman.

GEN 3:5       "For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."

GEN 5:1       This is the written account of Adam's line. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.

GEN 5:2       He created them male and female and blessed them. And when they were created, he called them "man."

GEN 5:3       When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.

MAT 11:28     "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

MAT 11:30     For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

MAT 20:28     just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

MAT 23:25     "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.

MAT 23:26     Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.

MAT 23:27     "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.

MAT 23:28     In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

LUK 2:49      "Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"

JOH 1:12      Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--

JOH 1:29      The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

JOH 3:18      Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.

JOH 5:30      By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.

JOH 5:39      You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me,

JOH 6:28      Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"

JOH 6:29      Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."

JOH 8:31      To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.

JOH 8:32      Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."

JOH 9:6       Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.

JOH 9:24      A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to God," they said. "We know this man is a sinner."

JOH 10:10     The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

JOH 13:34     "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.

JOH 13:35     By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

JOH 17:3      Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.

JOH 19:30     When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

ACT 15:5      Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, "The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses."

ACT 15:10     Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear?

ACT 15:11     No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are."

ACT 20:35     In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"

ROM 4:15      because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.

ROM 4:21      being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.

ROM 5:1       Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

ROM 5:2       through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.

ROM 5:8       But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

ROM 5:11      Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.

ROM 5:12      Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--

ROM 5:17      For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.

ROM 6:3       Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?

ROM 6:4       We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.

ROM 6:10      The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.

ROM 6:11      In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.

ROM 6:14      For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.

ROM 6:15      What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!

ROM 7:8       But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead.

ROM 7:15      I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.

ROM 7:24      What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?

ROM 7:25      Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.

ROM 8:1       Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,

ROM 8:28      And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.

ROM 8:38      For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,

ROM 8:39      neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

ROM 10:4      Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.

ROM 12:1      Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God--this is your spiritual act of worship.

ROM 12:2      Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will.

ROM 13:14     Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.

ROM 14:23     But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.

ROM 15:7      Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.

EPH 4:22      You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;

EPH 4:23      to be made new in the attitude of your minds;

EPH 4:24      and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

EPH 4:32      Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.

EPH 5:8       For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light

EPH 5:18      Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.

PHI 1:29      For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him,

PHI 2:3       Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.

PHI 3:8       What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ

PHI 3:9       and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.

PHI 3:20      But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,

PHI 4:6       Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.

PHI 4:7       And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

PHI 4:8       Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.

COL 1:27      To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

COL 1:28      We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.

COL 1:29      To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.

COL 2:3       in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

COL 2:9       For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,

COL 2:10      and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.

COL 2:11      In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ,

COL 2:12      having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.

COL 2:13      When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,

COL 2:14      having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross.

COL 2:23      Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.

COL 3:1       Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

COL 3:2       Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.

COL 3:3       For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.

1TH 5:18      give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.

TIT 2:11      For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.

TIT 2:12      It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,

TIT 2:13      while we wait for the blessed hope--the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,

TIT 2:14      who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.

TIT 2:15      These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.

HEB 4:9       There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;

HEB 4:10      for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.

HEB 4:16      Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.

HEB 9:26      Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.

HEB 10:4      because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

HEB 10:10     And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

HEB 11:6      And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.

HEB 11:37     They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated--

HEB 11:38     the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.

HEB 11:39     These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised.

HEB 11:40     God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.

JAM 1:2       Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds,

JAM 1:25      But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does.

JAM 2:10      For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.

JAM 4:6       But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."

1PE 1:6       In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.

1PE 1:7       These have come so that your faith--of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire--may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.

1PE 2:24      He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.

1PE 3:18      For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit,

1PE 4:12      Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.

2PE 1:3       His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.

1JO 4:8       Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.

1JO 4:19      We love because he first loved us.

1CO 2:16      "For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.

1CO 6:11      And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

1CO 6:15      Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!

1CO 6:16      Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh."

1CO 6:17      But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit.

1CO 6:18      Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body.

1CO 6:19      Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;

1CO 6:20      you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.

1CO 10:13     No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.

1CO 12:13     For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free--and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.

1CO 15:22     For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.

1CO 15:56     The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.

2CO 3:6       He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

2CO 3:7       Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,

2CO 3:8       will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?

2CO 3:9       If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!

2CO 5:14      For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.

2CO 5:17      Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!

2CO 5:18      All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:

2CO 5:21      God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

2CO 11:3      But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.

GAL 2:20      I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

GAL 2:21      I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!"

GAL 3:1       You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.

GAL 3:2       I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law, or by believing what you heard?

GAL 3:3       Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort?

GAL 3:10      All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law."

GAL 3:11      Clearly no one is justified before God by the law, because, "The righteous will live by faith."

GAL 3:12      The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, "The man who does these things will live by them."

GAL 3:23      Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.

GAL 3:24      So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith.

GAL 3:25      Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law.

GAL 5:1       It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.

GAL 5:2       Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.

GAL 5:3       Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.

GAL 5:4       You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.

GAL 5:13      You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love.

GAL 5:14      The entire law is summed up in a single command: "Love your neighbor as yourself."

GAL 5:15      If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.

GAL 5:16      So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.

GAL 5:17      For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.

GAL 5:18      But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.

GEN 15:6      Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.

GEN 20:6      Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.

DEU 7:6       For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession.

DEU 7:7       The LORD did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples.

DEU 7:8       But it was because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your forefathers that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

DEU 7:9       Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands.

DEU 9:4       After the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, "The LORD has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness." No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is going to drive them out before you.

DEU 9:5       It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the LORD your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

DEU 9:6       Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.

JOB 10:12     You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit.

JOB 22:2      "Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise man benefit him?

JOB 22:3      What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?

PSA 94:17     Unless the LORD had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.

PSA 94:18     When I said, "My foot is slipping," your love, O LORD, supported me.

PSA 94:19     When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul.

PSA 138:3     When I called, you answered me; you made me bold and stouthearted.

PSA 143:11    For your name's sake, O LORD, preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.

DAN 9:18      Give ear, O God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy.

DAN 10:18     Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength.

DAN 10:19     "Do not be afraid, O man highly esteemed," he said. "Peace! Be strong now; be strong." When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength."

JOH 6:44      "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.

JOH 6:45      It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.

JOH 17:11     I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name--the name you gave me--so that they may be one as we are one.

JOH 17:12     While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.

JOH 17:15     My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.

ACT 4:29      Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.

ACT 4:30      Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus."

ACT 26:22     But I have had God's help to this very day, and so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen--

ROM 3:22      This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference,

ROM 3:23      for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

ROM 3:24      and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.

ROM 4:4       Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation.

ROM 4:5       However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.

ROM 4:16      Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring--not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.

ROM 5:2       through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.

ROM 5:6       You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.

ROM 5:7       Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.

ROM 5:8       But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

ROM 5:15      But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!

ROM 5:16      Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.

ROM 5:17      For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.

ROM 5:18      Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.

ROM 5:19      For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.

ROM 5:20      The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,

ROM 5:21      so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROM 9:10      Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac.

ROM 9:11      Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election might stand:

ROM 9:12      not by works but by him who calls--she was told, "The older will serve the younger."

ROM 9:13      Just as it is written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."

ROM 9:14      What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!

ROM 9:15      For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."

ROM 9:16      It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.

ROM 11:5      So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.

ROM 11:6      And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.

1CO 1:4       I always thank God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.

1CO 1:5       For in him you have been enriched in every way--in all your speaking and in all your knowledge--

1CO 1:6       because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.

1CO 1:7       Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.

1CO 1:8       He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1CO 10:13     No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.

1CO 15:10     But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them--yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.

2CO 1:12      Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace.

GAL 1:15      But when God, who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace, was pleased

GAL 1:16      to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man,

EPH 1:5       he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will--

EPH 1:6       to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves.

EPH 1:7       In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace

EPH 1:8       that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.

EPH 1:9       And he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,

EPH 1:11      In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,

EPH 1:12      in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.

EPH 2:8       For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--

EPH 2:9       not by works, so that no one can boast.

EPH 3:16      I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,

EPH 4:7       But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.

EPH 6:10      Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.

PHI 1:19      for I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.

PHI 2:13      for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.

1TH 1:1       Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you.

1TI 1:14      The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

2TI 1:1       Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,

2TI 1:9       who has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,

TIT 3:7       so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.

1PE 1:5       who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.

1PE 4:10      Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.

1PE 5:10      And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.

JUD 1:1       Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ:

JUD 1:21      Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.

JUD 1:24      To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy--

JUD 1:25      to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.

REV 3:10      Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth.
