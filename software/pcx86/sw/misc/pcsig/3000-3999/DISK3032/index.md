Special Requirements: Graphic monitor. EGA/VGA and a hard drive recommen
                                                                        
JOKE TALK, DOS Joke's big brother, performs computer shenanigans and    
talks through your PC's speaker as it does it. The joke telling portion 
displays a joke on the screen as it "speaks" it. The computer voice is  
easily understood and the jokes are nutty. For example, "My husband took
me out for a royal evening; dinner at Burger King and dessert at Dairy  
Queen!"                                                                 
                                                                        
You can also play "Name That Tune." Only a few songs are included and   
while the sound is not CD quality, it is recognizable.  Other portions  
of the program include famous person impressions, animal sounds, human  
sounds (same as DOS Joke), and the Candid Camera Show. The Candid Camera
Show is interesting because it works like a screen saver by drawing     
attractive graphics on your computer screen when you're away. Its humor 
content comes from the human sounds, jokes, or animal sounds that are   
periodically injected. This is great when you leave your cubical at work
and want to keep your co-workers on their toes. JOKE TALK also lets you 
take its library of sounds and words (59 in all) and create your own    
combinations.                                                           
                                                                        
With 59 sounds and sentences, JOKE TALK is not the type of program you  
use to entertain yourself. However, it's a good demonstration of voice  
synthesis on the PC and has unlimited practical joke potential.
