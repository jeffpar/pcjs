MoraffWare super-VGA software enclosed!

   MoraffWare is THE high-res game company. We have the only super-VGA games
in the world! Enclosed on this diskette are the latest versions of our
hottest games, demos and our first educational program.

   What follows are descriptions of the games and demos enclosed on this
diskette:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Each program is placed in its own subdirectory. The subdirectory TINYPRGS
contains our new set of very small programs which are designed to be included
with VGA cards, modems, computers or any other product that has a little
space left on the utility disks. Information on these programs is included
in a separate README file in the TINYPRGS directory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The following games fully support Hercules (720x348), CGA (320x200), EGA
(640x350), VGA (640x480 16 colors), MCGA (320x200 256 colors), VGA (360x480
256 colors), 800x600 in 16 colors and 1024x768 in 16 and 256 colors!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moraff's World:

   Moraff's World is the ultimate dungeon game. It contains 16 level deep
dungeons with brick walls, wooden doors and monsters with fangs and claws. See
monsters far off in the distance down the best 3D corridors ever seen in a
computer game. Moraff's World rivals the CAD programs!

   Fight many different types of monsters, cast over 100 different spells,
much more. This game puts commercial computer games to shame!

   Moraff's world contains built-in intelligent help that realizes when you
are confused, and makes suggestions appropriately. All commands are one-key,
no typing of words or sentences.

   Moraff's World appeals to older teens, doctors, lawyers and to retired
people who have less pressing responsibilities to ignore while playing
this immensely addictive game. For those who do undertake to play Moraff's
World, we strongly recommend a week's supply of food and water be kept
not in the kitchen (which is generally to far away), but next to the computer,
where it can be consumed without looking away from the computer screen.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moraff's Stones:

   This game was inspired by Moraff's World. Stones is a classy gambling game
played against monsters. The monsters start off pretty simple-minded and
easy to beat, and even relatively friendly. But each time a monster goes broke
and can't buy into the next hand, he (it?) gets replaced by a more intelligent
and not-as-friendly monster. Eventually the user finds himself surrounded by
backstabbing, hard-core gamblers at the highest levels of the game.

   MoraffWare offers a special version of Stones with Sound Blaster
support, so that the player can hear insults from real voices.

   This game has a wide appeal ranging from teenagers to old-time card
players who enjoy playing a card-like game in the pleasant company of nice
congenial monsters.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moraff's Super Entrap:

   Stunning is the only way to describe the graphics in this 3D maze game.
The player is found standing on a massive playing field that stretches off
far into the distance. The playing field is shown suspended in space, and,
when played in 256 color mode, the background can be seen to move and change
colors constantly.

   The objective is to reach the other end of the playing field without being
caught by the enemy robots that roam the surface of the maze. The player
has the ability to modify the maze as he progresses through it, creating
traps for the enemy robots. At first, this is quite easy, as the robots have
intelligence roughly equivalent to that of a dead fish. As the game progresses,
however, the enemies become both more intelligent and more capable, as they
also begin to modify the maze.

   This is a logic game of the highest order, with 3D graphics rivalled only
by Moraff's World.

   Moraff's Super Entrap appeals to people of any age, but it has particular
appeal to those people who feel they can leave no puzzle unsolved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moraff's Super Blast:

   This is the latest update of Moraff's Super Blast to keep your catalog
updated. This game supports CGA, EGA, VGA and 800x600.
   Moraff's Super Blast is the ultimate breakout-Arkanoid type game. It
contains 34 screens plus falling walls and traditional breakout. The bricks
have all kinds of special effects like moving, exploding, they eat balls, etc.
This game also allows up to 17 simultaneous balls, and two players can play
at the same time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VGA Art:

   VGA Art really uses your monitor to its full capabilities. This program
is the perfect program to use in a computer store to compare the many
different monitors and graphics cards now available.

   This program is also fun to just sit and watch, or to leave running
when your computer is not in use. It contains fractal landscapes and other
pseudo-fractals, snaking palette changes, and something that we at MoraffWare
call the `Liquid Screen'.

   This program also allows the user to control the palette changes, and
to decide what type of image to create next.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mather:

	Mather is a different kind of game/learning tool. This program allows
the user to win all manner of wonderful and not-so-wonderful prizes by
answering a few simple math problems! When the problems are answered
correctly, the questions become tougher and the prizes become bigger.

	Mather is designed to challenge anyone with the will to achieve,
including the developers at MoraffWare who no longer need calculators.

	Help people achieve by distributing Mather and other educational
shareware to your customers.
