        Long Description:
        -----------------
           This latest update, Stable - Technical Graphs v1.10, contains many
           of your most requested features, as well as being Windows 3.0/3.1
           compatible.  Written for experienced and novice users alike,
           Stable provides powerful - yet easy to use - stock market

           with existing (or access to) historical financial data for stocks,

           Stable - Technical Graphs reads CSI, Technical Tools, MetaStock,
           and ASCII formatted data files; allowing you to use your existing
           data more effectively.  All Stable charts support horizontal
           scrolling - giving you the ability to study as many as 1,024 units
           (days, weeks, etc.) of data in a single graph. And when you
           identify a chart worthy of more attention, simply print it to one
           of your system printers.

        Description/Author Information                          Page 3 of 5


           All Stable charts provide an easy to use "slider" for accurately
           comparing a specific day's activity across several graphs.  Also
           available for every chart is a "toolbar" providing single mouse
           click operation of frequently used charting operations and tools.

           In addition to the above capabilities, other standard features
           found in Stable - Technical Graphs include:
   
              - The display of up to 64 market charts for individual and
                comparative study, with each chart containing as many as
                1,024 units (days, weeks, months) of data.

              - DDE support letting you communicate directly with any Stable
                chart through the use of third-party software (such as
                Microsoft Excel) to open, print, display - or to dynamically
                add new data to a chart.

              - Windows 3.1 "Drag and Drop" support allowing CSV and
                Technical Tools data files to be opened simply by "dragging"
                the file from the File Manager directly to the Stable logo
                window or icon.

              - User-selectable graph styles; including High/Low Bar, Line,
                and Histogram graphs.

              - Popup menu support within any graph allowing you to quickly
                perform many common graph functions.
        
              - Improved desktop chart management features such as closing
                or minimizing all charts, and easily moving from one chart
                to another.

              - The ability to print your technical charts to any attached
                printer using the provided print functionality of Windows.

              - On-line help documentation using the standard Window's Help
                program.

              - All chart and graph colors are easily selected and changed
                to suit your own personal preference.

              - An "Auto Chart Configuration Mode" giving you the option of
                having Stable automatically save your chart colors and
                technical indicator parameters.

              - Runs on most Windows supported displays; including EGA, VGA,
                VGA (monochrome), extended VGA resolutions (800 x 600 and 
                1024 x 780) - 16 and 256 color capable.

        monthly service, then the following restrictions apply:
        
           - ASP ASSOCIATE (DISK VENDOR) MEMBERS in good standing are hereby
             given permission to distribute the Stable - Technical Graphs
