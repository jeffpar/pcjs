               Some quick notes on simple play.


    In order to place a bet there must be money in the Player Bet
Bank.  This is the upper chip bank located in the lower right corner
of the game screen.  The lower chip bank is the Player Chip Bank.
    Initially all the money the player has is in the Player Chip
Bank. In order to move money from the Player Chip Bank to the Player
Bet Bank, or vice versa you must click with the mouse on the chip
stack desired. One of the selected chip will move from one chip bank
to the other chip bank.  These mouse click must be made ABOVE the
line that separates the chips from the total monetary value of all
chips in the chip bank.
    In order to place the bet click on the amount of the Player Bet
Bank.  This is below the separator line of this chip bank.  The
Change button in the center of the screen will then be replaced by
the Table Bet Button.  This is the amount of money at risk on this
round of Black Jack.
    If you wish another card (take a hit) click once one the shoe in
the upper right hand corner of the game screen.  If you wish to stand
on the cards present in your hand, then click on the Table Bet
Button.  This is the button in the center of the screen with a dollar
amount in it.
    If you wish to Surrender, Split, or Double Down; these button
will appear on the screen when the specific optional play is allowed
by the rules of the game in effect AND the Player possesses enough
money to cover any additional bets required.  These additional funds
will be taken directly from the Player Chip Bank.
    The Discard Pile in the upper left-hand corner of the screen will
present statistics on the cards previous played. Previously played
cards also include, if applicable, all visible cards currently on the
table.  The term previously played cards will be used with the
understanding that the cards on currently on the table are also
included. 
    These statistics are to help players develop, practice and
improve their card counting skills.  The statistics may either be a
catalog of all the cards played, broken down by rank; or the sum of
the rank weights of the cards previously played.
    The rules of the game includes: the size of the shoe, the
Dealer's play, the optional play, if any, open to the Player, and the
payoffs for various hand outcomes.  These parameters of play are all
controlled from the RULES menu.
    The HINT menu will give you hints on the best play available,
setting rank weights, and setting which of the two statistics will
appear with a click on the discard pile.

    The FILE menu allows you to save game parameters for later use
and to recall these parameter settings.  For example, the Blackjack
parameters of the exact play of Blackjack as played at the Aladdin
Casino in Las Vegas could be saved and used prior to your trip to
that casino.



    I hope you find this program as enjoyable to use as it was for me
and my colleagues and friends to debug and improve.
