                                                  more . . .
HOW TO PLAY (Continued)

When your ship lands on a space, one of the following things
will happen:

   QUESTION SPACE  You  will  be  asked  a  multiple  choice
                   question  about ships, pirates,  history,
                   sailing,  or  geography.  If you  get  it
                   right,  you  will  earn  gold,   cannons,
                   supplies,  or disaster  insurance  cards.
                   These spaces usually make the  difference
                   between winning and losing the game.

   DISASTER SPACE  Something bad will happen.  You will lose
                   turns, go back (which isn't always  bad),
                   lose treasure, or lose supplies.  Certain
                   supplies  avoid certain  disasters:  rope
                   will help you get off sandbars, a compass
                   will  help  you  navigate  through   fog,
                   bales  of  cotton plug up  holes  in  the
                   bottom of your ship.  Of course, disaster
                   insurance cards cancel these disasters.


                                                  more . . .
TYPES OF SPACES ON THE GAME BOARD (Continued)

   TREASURE SPACE  Find treasure!

   MISCELLANEOUS   Buy supplies, find treasure maps,  ransom
                   hostages, buy cannons, take chances, etc.

   RAID A CITY     It is usually to your advantage to  fight
                   a city because you may win some of  their
                   gold, and the only thing you have to lose
                   is  one turn.  Hint: get as many  cannons
                   as  you  can as soon  as  possible!

   FIGHT A PLAYER  When  you land on another player's  ship,
                   you  have  the choice to  fight  for  the
                   space  or to fall back to the first  open
                   space.   If you fight, EACH PLAYER  risks
                   losing  up to half of their gold  to  the
                   other player.  Hint: get as many  cannons
                   as  you  can as soon  as  possible!   The
                   attacker always has the advantage because
                   attackers always win ties.

                                                  more . . .

FIGHTING WITH CANNONS:

It will be to your advantage to get as many cannons (maximum
of  four)  as possible.  Each time you raid a  city,  attack
another  player, or another player attacks you, here's  what
happens:

   1)  The  attacker and defender will appear on the  screen
       and Redhook will arbitrate the fight.

   2)  The  defender will roll the dice first:  one die  for
       each cannon he/she has.

   3)  Next  the  attacker will roll the dice, one  die  for
       each cannon he/she has.

   4)  Redhook  will  sort the dice on the screen  from  the
       highest   to  the  lowest  and  determine  who   won.
       ATTACKERS WIN ALL TIES.

   5)  Redhook will award any loot won to the victor, and in
       the case of a ship to ship fight, send the loser back
       to the first open space.

                                                  more . . .
FIGHTING WITH CANNONS (Continued)

Smart players watch other players closely:  It's not usually
to  your  advantage to fight another player when  they  have
landed  on  a  disaster space.   Remember,  when  you  fight
another  player,  EACH player can lose up to HALF  of  their
gold to the other player -- if you have lots of gold and few
cannons,  don't  attack  a player who has  little  gold  and
several  cannons!   On the other hand, if you  are  in  last
place, try to attack players with piles of  gold -- remember
attackers always win ties.


FOOD / WATER / RUM:

One  ration  of food, water, and rum is used on  each  turn.
Some spaces allow you to buy these items; it is up to you to
determine whether the price is fair, and how much you should
buy  when given the opportunity.  If you run out of  one  of
the  above  items, you will lose a turn,  and  Redhook  will
force you to by them at the following prices:
    Food    50  doubloons per day
    Water   30  doubloons per day
    Rum     100 doubloons per day
                                                  more . . .
OTHER SUPPLIES:

Rope,  canvas,  cotton, and a compass will all help  you  to
avoid certain disasters along the way.  You can't buy  these
items:  generally,  the only way to get these  items  is  to
answer a question space correctly.


HOSTAGES:

Sometimes  after looting ships and cities you  will  capture
hostages.   Redhook may offer ransom for your hostages  from
time to time:  it's up to you to determine whether the price
is  fair, or whether to hold out for a higher  price  later.
Hostages  which are not ransomed by the end of the game  are
worthless.


TREASURE MAPS:

Treasure  maps are either extremely valuable  or  worthless.
You won't know until you find one!


                                                  more . . .
                        A FINAL NOTE

Much  of  the  pirate's dialogue  comes  from  Robert  Louis
Stevenson's  classic novel, "Treasure Island".  Many of  the
expressions  used by the pirates in Redhook's  Revenge  such
as, "skulk", "don't stand there squalling", "lubber", "bless
me  deadlights", and "if you had the pluck of a weevil in  a
biscuit"  evolved  from life on the  sea.   The  expression,
"meaner than the son of a double Dutchman" developed because
the  Dutch were the most feared of all pirates.   There  are
hundreds  of these saying in Redhook's Revenge, and we  hope
that it enhances your pleasure in playing it.

The  factual information for Redhook's Revenge  was  derived
from the books "The Funnel of Gold" by Mendel Peterson, "The
Sack  of  Panama" and "The Treasure of  the  Concepcion"  by
Peter  Earle.  We wish to thank these scholars for their  in
depth research.

The name "Redhook" was taken from Redhook Bay on St.  Thomas
Island.   Most  of the names on the playing board,  such  as
Gallows  Point,   can be found somewhere in  the  Caribbean.
The  player's names, with the exception of  Blackbeard,  are
fictitious.

                   Copyright (c) 1993, ImagiSOFT, Inc.

                       ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS


   QUESTION:  I get the message "VGA Monitor required." when I try  to
              run Redhook's Revenge.  What I do?

   ANSWER:    Your  IBM compatible PC doesn't have a VGA monitor.   If
              you  want to run Redhook's Revenge, you will have to  go
              to a computer store to see it run.  Maybe you'll  decide
              that it's time to get a new computer!


   QUESTION:  Can I run Redhook's Revenge from a floppy drive?

   ANSWER:    Yes, by entering the command REDHOOK, but the game  will
              run slower than it would on a hard drive.


   QUESTION:  How do I install Redhook's Revenge to my hard drive?

   ANSWER:    We  have provided a simple installation program so  that
              you can install Redhook's Revenge to your hard drive:
             1.  Insert the diskette into the floppy drive.
             2.  Type A:INSTALL (or B:INSTALL) then press [Enter].
             3.  Follow  the  instructions  as  they  appear  on  your
                 screen.  You can install it to any directory that you
                 want to, but for the purposes of this  documentation,
                 we assume that you will install it to C:\REDHOOK.


   QUESTION:  My mouse works in Microsoft Windows, why doesn't it work
              in Redhook's Revenge?

   ANSWER:    Windows  has special built-in drivers to support   mice.
              Our  software  looks for a Microsoft   compatible  mouse
              driver which is loaded when you  turn on your  computer.
              A  diskette  should  have  come with  your  mouse  which
              contains  MOUSE.SYS,   MOUSE.COM or similar  files.  Try
              placing   the    command  DEVICE = MOUSE.SYS   in   your
              CONFIG.SYS  file  or  the   command  MOUSE.COM  in  your
              AUTOEXEC.BAT  file.    These  are  the  files  that  DOS
              executes  when you  turn on your computer, and  if  your
              mouse  is  Microsoft compatible, your mouse  should  now
              work.




   QUESTION:  Can Redhook's Revenge be run under Microsoft Windows?

   ANSWER:    Yes, although it is not a Windows product.  Here's how:
           1.  In  the Program Manager press the ALT-F for the  "Files
               Menu".
           2.  Press N for "New".
           3.  Select "Program Item".
           4.  Under "Description" enter Redhook.
           5.  Under "Command Line" enter \REDHOOK\REDHOOK.PIF.
           6.  Press the "Change Icon" button and when it prompts  for
               the file name enter \REDHOOK\REDHOOK.ICO then press OK.


   QUESTION:  I  get the message "Not enough memory" and  my   program
              doesn't run. What can I do?

   ANSWER:    You  need a computer with at least 640K memory  to   run
              our software. Run the CHKDSK command to make  sure  that
              you  have "655360 total bytes memory".   The  last  line
              tells  you how many bytes your  computer has  free.   If
              your  computer  has  less than   560000  bytes  free,  a
              program loaded in your  CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT  file
              is taking up  memory. Locate a knowledgeable person  and
              ask  him/her to help you get these programs out of  your
              memory.  If  you  have  a 286  or  386  computer  and  1
              megabyte  of  memory or more, you  can  free  additional
              memory by upgrading to DOS 5.0.


   QUESTION:  I  don't understand what "shareware" is.  Why do I  have
              to  order Redhook's Revenge if I already have a copy  of
              it?

   ANSWER:    Because  you  haven't  paid for  it.   If  you  "bought"
              Redhook's Revenge from a shareware vendor, you only paid
              for  the disk, not the actual program.  At  the  opening
              screen  of  Redhook's  Revenge, press  the  F2  key.   A
              detailed  explanation about the shareware  concept  will
              appear for you there.

              To reward those who actually register Redhook's  Revenge
              we have included extra "bonus" features which are not in
              the shareware version.  See the order form for details.

                         THANK YOU!

We  at ImagiSOFT enjoyed developing Redhook's  Revenge,  and
hope  you  like  it  as  much  as  we  do.   Mike  Prestwich
researched   Redhook,  developed  the  concept,  wrote   the
documentation, and wrote the script.  We would like to thank
Robert  Louis  Stevenson, from whom we  borrowed  generously
from  his  classic  work,  Treasure  Island.   Most  of  the
historical  information about pirates, ships,  weapons,  and
events  came from the books "The Funnel of Gold"  by  Mendel
Peterson, and "The Sack of Panama" and "The Treasure of  the
Concepcion" by Peter Earle.

David Sanders developed many new assembly language  routines
to  program Redhook; it is his remarkable talent that  makes
Redhook  (and  our  other products) work  so  well  on  your
computer.  Russ Chancellor's extraordinary artwork was drawn
by  hand on the screen, not scanned, using Deluxe  Paint II.
Robert  Allen composed the music which adds so much  to  the
atmosphere  of Redhook.  Lastly, our quality  control  staff
gave Redhook a thorough work out before it was released.

Of  course,  without  the financial  support  of  our  loyal
customers, Redhook's Revenge wouldn't be have been  created.
We appreciate you most of all!

NEW! ImagiSOFT, the people brought you Chinese Checkers, have
surpassed themselves with their incredible new board game, Redhook's
Revenge!  Two or three players assume the role of an animated pirate
character.  The object: have the most gold doubloons at the end of the
game!  Redhook's Revenge was inspired by the classic board games,
RISK, MONOPOLY, LIFE, and TRIVIAL PURSUIT and took many of its ideas
from the classic novel Treasure Island.  Play is simple: roll the dice
and see whether you fight a city, discover treasure, get lost in a
storm, visit the Mermaid Isles, take another turn, answer a trivia
question, buy a cannon, etc.  Compete against other players or play
against the computer.  Redhook's witty pirate sayings, professional
artwork, historical trivia, and theme music entertain you for hours!
Recommended for Ages 8 through adult.  Use the keyboard or a Microsoft
compatible mouse.  Adlib and Soundblaster compatible sound cards are
supported.  Requires VGA and 640K of memory.  Written by
ImagiSOFT, Inc., an ASP member.
