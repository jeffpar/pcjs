Author Registration: $45.00                                             
Special Requirements: 640K RAM and a hard drive.                        
                                                                        
PC-INDEX lets you add a "back of the book" index to any document or     
group of documents. Some high-end word processors include this feature, 
but PC-INDEX is a high-speed version available to all word processors.  
                                                                        
You can create indexes that are either word based or phrase based.      
Word-based indexes list words and the page numbers they occur on. In    
phrase indexes, words and associated phrases are listed with their      
corresponding page numbers.                                             
                                                                        
Once you've completed the index, you can have PC-INDEX print it or      
import it to your favorite word processor for printing. PC-INDEX can    
also extract proper names (great for genealogists), create word         
frequency lists, and import documents from WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, 
WordStart, and MultiMate, as well as standard ASCII format.
