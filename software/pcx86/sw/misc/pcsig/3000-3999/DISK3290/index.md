Welcome to Visual Basic Toolbox Pro

First off I'd like to thank everyone who sent in suggestions for this new 
version, I've tried to incorporate as many as possible, I think you'll be 
pleasantly suprised.  

Installation Instructions:

This program can only be used with Visual Basic. If you don't have
Visual Basic this program will be on no use to you...


Copy the files THREED.VBX, SS3D2.VBX, and HOTKEY.DLL into your 
\Windows\System directory. Copy the files VBTBOX2.EXE, VB-TB.HLP and 
TOOLBOX2.CFG to your Visual Basic directory.  If the file VBTBOX2.EXE 
is in your VB directory it will call Visual Basic upon start up.

New Features in VBToolbox Pro:

1. Full printing capabilities from the smallest code fragment to 
   the entire project.
2. F6 hotky added for quick code printing 
3. List of all active windows task ID#'s and hWnd's 
4. List of all available VBx files, add to your project with a double click
   of your mouse.
5. You may now launch any number of programs from within the VB environment.
6. Help file that also contains declarations for the most commonly used 
   freeware, and public domain dll's, giving you a central reference.
   This was the most common request among current users, as long as there 
   is continued interest I'll try my best to keep this file updated. 


I've tried my best to be clear and concise in documentation and error 
handling Messages.  If I've overlooked something or if my instuctions 
can be clarified in any way drop me a line and I'll try to make 
modifications as I can.

Thanks for trying Visual Basic Toolbox Pro.
