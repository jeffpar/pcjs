Disk Title: Hugo III, Jungle of Doom 2/2 (also #3042                    
PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: Hugo III, Jungle of Doom!                                
Author Version: 1.0S                                                    
Author Registration: $20.00 ($40.00 for trilogy)                        
Special Requirements: 400K RAM and EGA. Hard drive recommended.         
                                                                        
Our heroes, Hugo and Penelope, crash land in the jungles of South       
America.  Hugo (that's you) starts to work on the plane and Penelope    
decides to take a walk (...I just bet something bad is going to happen).
Bingo!-Penelope is bitten by the dreaded tree spider and you (Hugo)     
have only 48 hours to find the antidote in the "Jungle of Doom!"        
                                                                        
This is Part III of the Hugo series. All Hugo games-HOUSE OF HORRORS,   
WHODUNIT?, and JUNGLE OF DOOM-are a special mix of text adventure games 
with arcade-style graphics. In text adventure-games, you interact with  
the game by typing instructions to the program. You might type in:      
"pickup sword," "cast a spell," or "tie vines to bridge." These games   
test inventiveness and your ability to interact in these computer       
created scenarios. Most popular of these games are the "Dungeons and    
Dragons" type of games.                                                 
                                                                        
The Hugo series adds arcade quality graphics, making the adventure more 
fun. In JUNGLE OF DOOM, you walk down jungle paths, cross rivers, pass  
through jungle villages, talk to natives, and explore in order to locate
the antidote to the poison. The animation is first rate. Each time you  
encounter an item or person, you type in an action or response. What    
makes text-adventure games challenging is that you must type in actions 
in a way that the computer understands them. It might accept "pick up   
key" or "grab key" but not "hand me the key." The documentation for     
these types of games is notoriously brief and it's up to you to         
establish the proper dialogue. This can be frustrating at first, but it 
adds an extra level of complexity that real adventure buffs crave.      
                                                                        
Hugo's JUNGLE OF DOOM has all the ingredients to be another successful  
game. The story is fun and well presented with superb graphics. It's a  
good program to start with if you're new to adventure games, and great  
if you're an old hand.
