## INSTALL.DOC

{% raw %}
```
Castle of the Winds uses CommDlg.DLL, the Windows Common Dialogs DLL.
If you are running Win 3.1, you already have a copy and can delete
the one that comes with Castle.  If you are running 3.0, you may
already have a copy in your Windows System directory if you've
installed another application that uses this DLL.  If you don't have
the file, or if the version shipped with Castle is more recent, you
should copy this file to your System directory.

Once this is done you can then use the File-Run command in the
Program Manager to launch Castle (if you placed it somewhere on 
your path), or you can setup up an icon that points to where you 
copied the program.

Have Fun!

                            CASTLE OF THE WINDS
                     For Microsoft Windows 3.0 or later

              By Rick Saada  *  Published by Epic MegaGames

 The challenge of Fantasy Role-Playing meets the quality of Microsoft Windows

   Epic MegaGames brings you Castle of the Winds,  a fantasy role playing game
created by Rick Saada.  Your quest begins with A Question of Vengeance, as you
try to discover the secret of your mysterious past, and why is has proven so
deadly to those you love.  It then continues with Lifthransir's Bane, as you
attempt to vanquish the dark forces of evil which plague the land and are
after your life!

   Set in the world of Norse mythology, this game has plenty of surprises.
Nearly a hundred unique monsters oppose your quest, and there are hundreds
of enchanted objects to aid you.  Castle of the Winds presents a new style of
adventure game. While the anchor points of the story remain the same, most of
the adventure is created anew every time you play, so the game can be enjoyed 
again and again.

   Fans of fantasy and adventure games will love this one.  With over three
years in development,  this game beats commercial Windows games hands down,
and extensive online help gets you off to a great start on your journey.


Requirements:
     * Windows 3.0 or later
     * Hard disk
     * At least 1 meg RAM.

Ordering:
     * $25+$2 p&h includes registration,  hint sheet,  and Castle of the
       Winds part II, Lifthransir's Bane.

This game is 100% fully-featured and functional,  as are all shareware
releases from Epic MegaGames.
