                        Brief Overview of the Game

        You are Tyler Norris, a ten year-old who has had to grow up quite
rapidly. You must escape your dream by solving bizarre puzzles, traveling to
strange lands, and meeting even stranger creatures. It's all in your mind--so
nothing can hurt you...  Right?


                            The Story So Far

        Life has not been easy for Tyler Norris. The stressed ten year-old boy
has to deal with school, his paper route, and the recent loss of his father.
Over the past few evenings,  he has been having several extremely vivid and
detailed dreams,  dreams in which he met odd characters and solved many
puzzles.

        Tonight,  Tyler falls asleep after a particularly bad day -- his report
card came. He begins to dream. It starts out as any night before, but
suddenly he is falling through a storm to an unknown destination. Tyler lands
in a deserted alleyway in an unfamiliar city. He wipes himself off, stands up,
and begins to piece together the puzzles that will unlock his happiest and
most sinister thoughts, resulting in a confrontation with the evil that lurks
in all of us.


                                How To Play

Looking, taking, and moving around:

        The mouse pointer in Dare to Dream is "Intelligent", meaning that it
knows when it is being moved over something of interest. On the first screen,
move the pointer to the underwear hanging in the top left of the alleyway. The
pointer changes to a spyglass, letting you know that the underwear may be of
some interest to you. Click once, and a description of what you see appears
in the StatusBox (the window at the bottom of the screen). Whenever playing
Dare to Dream -always- remember that one click looks around. Now, Double Click
(two clicks in rapid succession) to take the underwear. A message appears
telling you the action you have just performed in the StatusBox.

        To see what you are carrying, click INVENTORY on the Remote (the
window on the left side of the screen). This brings up a window showing
everything you have. Click on the underwear. A description of it appears on
the right side of the window. Now click OK to have that item in your hands.
You can use that item on whatever you want simply by Double Clicking.

        Now move the mouse to the picture of the street ahead. The pointer
turns into an arrow that says EXIT on it. Click once, and you will look to
see where that exit leads to. DoubleClick and you will walk there. Now you're
in front of Bouf's Bar and Auto Repair!

Talking and character interaction:

        If there is someone on the screen who can be spoken to, move the
mouse pointer over the person and it will change to a SPEAK balloon. Click
TALK on the Remote to speak to that person. A window will appear (if that
person feels like talking) with a close-up of the character along with various
questions you can ask.  Click any question to get a response. A "Goodbye" or
"See you later" will end the conversation.

        Certain people must be given items or have items used on them. To do
this, you must first have an item selected (a picture of it on the Remote).
Then Double Click on the character to use the item on him/her/it. Remember to
always talk to everyone several times at different points in the game, as they
may have new things to say.

Solving puzzles:

        Dare to Dream is not a typical graphic adventure by ANY means. You
cannot "die" or "get stuck" like in some other popular adventures. The
creators of Dare have a belief that a player should be rewarded for his
curiosity, not thwacked on the head repeatedly. There are only so many times
a gamer will be burned to death before he turns off the game and does
something else.

        There is no point in Dare to Dream in which you can "get stuck"
either. In many other games,  you'll find yourself at the end only to
discover there was an irretrievable item that you missed 73 screens back.  If
you think you are at a part in Dare that that happens, you may have overlooked
something a few screens back. You don't have to restart your entire quest,
just walk back there and get it.

        Remember there is a solution to EVERYTHING. Be absurd, try a fish in
a keyhole, try using Petroleum Jelly on sewer grates -- ANYTHING can happen in
a dream!

Saving and restoring your game:

        Certain adventure games expect you to finish them in one sitting.
Dare to Dream, however, allows you to save your position so you can continue
on with your life and return to the game later.

        To save your game click on SAVE on the Remote. The Save Game window
will appear. Click the slot (there are 5) that you want to save your game
into, type a description, and click OK.

        To restore your game, click RESTORE on the Remote. A window similar to
the Save Game window will appear, however it will say "Restore" instead. Click
on the game you want to restore, and click OK.

The many windows of Dare:

The REMOTE

        The Remote acts just like your television Remote Control. Each button
has an equally important function for controlling the game.

        (smaller buttons)

        SAVE-Saves your game in progress
        RESTORE-Restores a previously saved game
        ARRANGE-Arranges your three windows so that nothing overlaps
        HELP-Brings up Dare to Dream's Online Help system
        ABOUT-Shows ORDERING INFORMATION
        EXIT-Quits the game

        (larger buttons)

        TALK-Speak to whomever is in the room
        INVENTORY-Shows what you are carrying

        (others)

        Selected Item-A box that shows what you have in your hands.
                      (a caption below it tells what that item is)


The STATUS BOX

        The Status Box is where Dare to Dream "talks" to the player. If you
click a door then the text "The door is made of glass and leads inside the
bar" will appear in the StatusBox.


The MAIN GAME SCREEN

        This is what Tyler is seeing at the moment. Move the mouse over the
picture situated in the center and chances are it will change to one of
several pointers:

        EXIT-This is an exit that you can walk to.
        TALK-You can talk/interact with this person.
        SPYGLASS-There is something of interest here.

        Remember, one click will tell you what you see, two clicks (right
after one another) will perform an action. An action can be several things:
taking an object, using an object on something/some one, walking to an exit.


                        Beginner's Walk-Thru

        WARNING! THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SOLUTIONS TO THE FIRST FEW PUZZLES!
DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU LIKE A CHALLENGE!

        Okay, on the first screen there are two items you should get. One is
the underwear hanging on the clothesline. See it? It's in the upper left of
the screen. Now you need the balloon in the garbage. Move the pointer to the
lower middle part of the screen, amoungst the spilled trash. Take the balloon
and go north (move the mouse to the street ahead and Double Click). You're in
front of Bouf's. Enter through the door (honest!) and look around inside.

You'll notice that the door on the second floor is locked (the door is in the
upper right part of the picture). Exit Bouf's, and once outside head left.
You're at a street corner with a frightingly large advertisement for Cola on
the wall. Move the pointer to the street ahead-you want to head -around- the
corner. You'll arrive at a parking lot, go to the boat on the right side of
the screen (at the dock in the distance). Once there search the boat up and
down-look near the lip of the railing. You'll find a fish. Return to Bouf's
and use this fish on the door. Once inside the Repair Shop, talk to Bouf and
take the jar next to him (it's really tiny). Return to the front of Bouf's.
Head right. Now, use the Jelly (the jar you stole from Bouf) on the grate.
You can now go into the sewers! Good luck!

        When you order volumes 2 and 3 of Dare to Dream you will recieve a
hint book which contains solutions similar to this... you'll never be too
stressed over solving a difficult puzzle if you're not a "pro" adventurer!


Epic has included 3 bitmap pictures for your enjoyment:

        The Dare to Dream logo (can use as a Wallpaper)
        An EPIC Logo           (can use as a Wallpaper)
        An example MIDI setup  (an example MIDI Mapper setup)


TROUBLE-SHOOTING:

If you cannot run Dare to Dream,  here are some tips.

Q. I get the message "CANNOT FIND VBRUN100.DLL" whenever I try to run the game.
A. A file (VBRUN100.DLL) is missing from the game. Contact the BBS/Catalog/
   Vendor/Friend you acquired the game from. BBS's tend to remove that file
   as it is commonly used in many Windows programs. Leave a message to the
   Sysop or other users.  The file is widely available.

Q. I get the message "OUT OF MEMORY" or other odd messages when I try to run
   the game.
A. You do not have enough free RAM to run the game. Try closing all other
   applications and removing any wallpapers. If that doesn't work try lowering
   your resolution to 640x480 pixels.
   If THAT does not work, create a "Boot Disk". In your AUTOEXEC.BAT and
   CONFIG.SYS files include only the files that are needed to run Windows.

Q. I cannot seem to get my Sound Blaster playing!
A. Read the file SBSETUP.TXT for extensive information on how to do this.

             Making Dare to Dream work with your sound card

     Many users do not have their system set up to play MIDI sound files
in Windows 3.1. If you have a sound card, and you haven't configured Windows
to use your sound card, you must first install the proper Device Driver. 
When Windows is installed, the sound drivers are not installed for you. 
Microsoft has neglected to provide detailed instruction on this, so we will.
     
     From the Program Manager, double click on the Main group icon. Then,
double click on Control Panel.  This is where most of your Windows are
controlled.
     
     To start, Double Click on the Drivers icon. A list of the installed
Drivers will appear. If you haven't installed any drivers yet, the list
should contain - MIDI Mapper, Timer, [MCI] MIDI Sequencer, and [MCI] Sound
Driver. Now, click on the "Add" button. A list of the available Drivers will
be displayed. Highlight the driver for your device by clicking on the name 
of the driver that controls your sound device. ie. Highlight "Creative Labs
Sound Blaster Pro", if you have a Sound Blaster Pro. Windows will then ask
you to insert one of the Windows disks containing the proper driver.
     
     If the driver for your card or other Midi device is not listed, 
check any disks that came with your device or contact the manufacturer of 
the device to receive the proper Driver. This is also a good way to get
Updated Drivers, as they are rarely advertised by the manufacturer. You can
call the CREATIVE LABS BBS (makers of the Sound Blaster) at (408) 428-6660.
They have Windows 3.1 drivers for all of their versions of the Sound
Blaster.
     
     After you have the new driver, highlight "Unlisted or Updated
Driver", and Windows will prompt you you insert the disk containing the
driver. Some drivers will require you to enter the port or interrupt number.
Default for Sound Blaster is Port 220, Int 7. Refer to the manual of your
device for further information.

     After Windows has loaded the driver, you will be asked if you would
like to restart Windows. THIS MUST BE DONE BEFORE THE NEW DRIVER WILL TAKE
EFFECT! Select "Restart Windows Now", and Windows will reload.
     
     Once your device driver has been installed and Windows has 
restarted, you need to configure the MIDI Mapper. The MIDI Maper is used to
tell your driver how to handle the sound information. Start MIDI Mapper by
clicking on the MIDI Mapper icon in the Control Panel. In the "Name" section
of the window, you can select the setup necessary to run your sound card.
For Dare to Dream, you should use the "Extended(Ext)" or "All" setup
specific to your device. "Basic" or "General" will not work with Dare to 
Dream, as only 4 channels(13-16) are used in the "basic" setup and most of
the Dare to Dream soundtrack has more than 4 sounds at the same time. If
you get an error message saying the current setup references a device that
is not installed, then you have to choose a different one or Edit the
configuration manually - See Manually Configuring Your MIDI Mapper.
     
     If all the planets are aligned in your favor and you don't get an
error message, Run the SBSETUP.EXE program that came with Dare to Dream. 
This tells Dare to Dream that you are ready to experience the best music
heard from a Windows Application.

- Manually Configuring MIDI Mapper

     If the device Driver for your sound card or other Midi Device has 
been installed, you must tell the MIDI Mapper how to assign the music
channels to your sound device channels. Sounds technical, but if you've
gotten this far, it will be a piece of cake.
     
     Start MIDI Mapper by clicking on the MIDI Mapper icon in the Control
Panel. If the "Extended" or "All" MIDI setup is listed in the Name list, 
choose one of those, then close MIDI Mapper - you're ready to go. Don't use
the "Basic" or "General" map for your device. These setups only use 4 
channels(13-16) for music, and most of the soundtrack in Dare to Dream uses
more than 4 channels.
     
     If the "Extended" or "All" setup is not listed you must modify or
create you own map. To creat your own MIDI Mapper setup, click the New
button in the window. Choose a name and a Description for your new Map. 
ie. Name: MYSOUND, Description: Finally my Sound Card is Set Up.
     
     In the "Show" section of the MIDI Mapper window, select "Setups" 
by clicking on the word "Setups" or by pressing "s" on the keyboard. Now,
click on the Edit button. If the "Scr Chan" column doesn't show the numbers
1-16 sequentialy, change the number values in that column so it does. The
next column, "Dest Chan", needs to contain the numbers 1-10 sequentialy. The
channels from 11 to 16 can say "[none]". In the "Port Name" column, press 
the Down arrow and select the name of the sound device that you are using. 
If you are using a separate device for percussion, select the name of that
device for channel 10, as this is where the soundtrack sends the percussion
information. For the next column, "Patch Map Name", more often than not, you
can make all of these say "[none]", and the soundtrack will still work. But,
you may need to define the percussion channel (channel 10) to match the 
mapping of your sound device. For Sound Blaster, choose "MT-32". Refer to
your sound device manual to find the percussive Patch Map specific to your
device. Next, to activate the channels, click on the boxes in the "Active"
