  Dear Shareware Dealer;

  Q-INSTALL  is a fast and easy to use  installation  utility.  It allows
  you to create Professional-Looking customized installs for your program
  distribution.  Non-programmers can use it with ease.  It takes only
  minutes to create a complete custom made installation.

  Early feedback by Shareware Dealer evaluations gave Q-INSTALL their
  highest rating.  Users are very satisfied with the ease of use and the
  very small program size Q-Install uses for its Installation program.

  Q-Install is just the ticket for Shareware authors who have limited
  diskette space but still want a colorful customized Install Program.
  Q-Install does not waste space on features that are costly and are
  seldom used by those creating an Installation Program.

  Features Include:

       *  A high quality professional look.
       *  Fast colorful text (colors are easy to change).
       *  Very small distribution program size (below 24K).
          This leaves more room for your program files.
       *  Easy to define options and parameters via menu.
          (No cryptic programming language to learn!)
       *  Compiles an INSTALL.COM file for easy execution.
       *  Automatic checking of disk space.
       *  Automatic checking of directories and creation.
       *  Automatic detection of source drive.
       *  User override for target drive and directory destinations.
       *  Ability to display a text README file from menu screen.
       *  Ability to use self-extracting PKZIP or LHA files.
       *  Allows multiple install-to directories per diskette (up to 4).
           Most programs require only one directory per diskette.
       *  Multiple diskette installations are made simple.
       *  Royality-Free unlimited program runtime distribution for those
           who order/register.  Plus a free update to the latest version.
       *  BEST OF ALL - very low license/registration fee of only $20.
