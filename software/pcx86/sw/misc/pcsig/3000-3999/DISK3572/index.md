Your Quest
----------
It's long after the nuclear war and the only surviving humans live
in a few domes across the country.  You are the fiercest warrior of
the age and a refugee from Oil City, one of these domes.

You received a strange message from Hoosier City, another domed
city.  It seemed to be a distress call but was abruptly terminated
at the source before you could be sure.  No messages have been
received since.

You must go to Hoosier City by helicopter and check out what has
happened.  As you arrive at the Hoosier City dome you are attacked
by its automatic defense system.  You skillfully pilot your copter
between the enemy pods and take out an enemy gun position with your
rocket.  Then you approach the landing pad.

Upon landing on the dome you take the elevator down to the center of
the city.  You walk out and the elevator doors lock securely behind
you.  Immediately you notice that the inhabitants of Hoosier City
are hideous mutants.  You know now that you must rid the city of the
evil mutants and discover the fate of the true citizens of the city.

A few of the citizens may still be in the dome.  If they are they
will help you complete your mission.  But unfortunately the only
weapon you possess is a sword.  Nevertheless you are determined to
be victorious.

The Hoosier City Dome
---------------------
The dome is an incredibly large structure.  It occupies many square 
miles and is inhabited by various creatures.  Some are friendly but 
most are not.  The dome was constructed over a lake to provide water 
for the inhabitants.

You may enter most structures.  The entrances to some are hidden.
To discover the entrances to these you must listen to friendly
citizens hiding in Hoosier City.  You will find them hiding in caves
and other places.  They may also tell you how to find weapons and
equipment guarded by the inhabitants of the dome.

There are many underground caves, passageways and secret places in the 
Hoosier City dome.  Discovering and exploring these is crucial for a
successful completion of your mission.

Some areas of the dome are sectioned off by doors.  To open these 
doors you must have a key of the corresponding color.  You must have a 
pass card to open security doors.  White doors and secret passageways 
open without keys.  Opening chests also requires keys of the 
corresponding color.


Treasures
---------
Scattered around the dome are items you will need to succeed in your
mission.  These include the following:

Money bags -- These contain anywhere from $50 to $250.  Money can be 
used to buy ammo from the various Bob's Stores in the Dome.

Dollar Signs ($) -- These give you $1,000.

Hearts -- Picking up hearts adds to your health quotient.

Half Hearts -- adds to your health quotient.

Full Hearts -- These bring your health to its current maximum.

Health Vials -- These bring you to full health and extend your health 
meter.

Life -- adds a life to your current game.

Keys -- Picking up green or red keys adds to your respective totals.  
They can be used to open doors or treasure chests.

Freeze Clock -- stops all enemies for a short period of time.

Zap -- kills all enemies with poor armor that are on the current 
screen.

Weapons
-------
Following the letter W on the upper left of the game screen is a 
weapons list.  Initially it is blank because you have no weapons.  
When you acquire a weapon it will appear there.  There are many 
different weapons you may discover.  The sword and the axe have
unlimited ammo.  All other weapons have limited ammo.  The number of
shots remaining appear under the weapon.


Equipment
---------
You must find four pieces of equipment.  These are armor for
smashing rocks and taking half the damage your enemies inflict on
you, the flashlight for seeing underground, the boat for navigating
across water, and the aqualung for underwater travel.

long description: Action and intrigue abound in this engrossing new 
                  action/adventure game from MVP Software.  Track down and 
                  conquer the formidable dragon to drive the fierce invaders 
                  from Hoosier City.  To do so you must explore dangerous 
                  underground caverns, as well as other places no normal 
                  mortals dare to go, such as the spooky Crypt of the Undead.  
                  Hoosier City features sparkling EGA hi-res graphics and 
                  original Sound Blaster music and sound effects.  This game is 
                  so good that all three volumes of the trilogy have been 
                  published separately as retail games.  By MVP Software (ASP).

Requirements: 512K RAM, EGA/VGA, Sound Blaster optional.  $15 registration; 
              $30 for trilogy that completes the story.

Catalog vendors: Please include Hoosier City: Assault of the Orcs in your
                 printed and disk shareware catalogs.  For best sales results
                 use one of the above descriptions.  In addition, all MVP
                 product listings MUST include the words "by MVP Software" or
                 "an MVP Software production."  This encourages repeat sales,
                 which is good for both of us.  The only exception to this is
                 if the catalog has a separate MVP Software section.  No vendor
                 may charge a fee of more than $10.00 for the shareware version
                 of this product.  Vendors are encouraged to contact MVP
                 Software directly to get the latest version of the product
                 and to be added to our mailing list for direct mailings of
                 updates & future releases.

MVP Software a royalty on all copies sold in retail locations.  This does not
include any other type of shareware sales.  Suggested royalty is 10 cents per
copy sold.  (2) The vendor must provide reports to MVP Software not less than
quarterly of all rack sales minus returns.

Rack vendors meeting the above conditions must still receive written
authorization from MVP Software to distribute our products on shareware racks.
Permission may not be given in all cases; the decision will be on a case-by-
case basis, and we usually will want to inspect the packaging before granting
distribution permission.

I apologize to those rack vendors to whom these requirements seem onerous.
However, this is the only way we can control how our products get distributed
to make sure we have both a return on our investment and a reasonable chance
at getting a registration. 

We really appreciate the distribution that vendors give us.  And we will con-
tinue to work with vendors to make both of our businesses prosper.  Thanks for
your understanding of why this step is necessary.

And just to be clear: the above requirements do NOT apply to catalog sales.
