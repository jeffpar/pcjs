                       FROM THE MINDSCAPE SERIES


                      Programed by William Soleau
                        Version 1.0  (c) 1992

                                    or HD Floppy

                            Files Needed:
         Ladder.exe    Ladder.ov2    Ladder.ov5    Ladder.ov8

                              * Objective *

          Ladder Man is another problem solving puzzle game from
     Soleau Software. The objective is to find a way to collect all
     the yellow diamonds located on each floor, then succeed in
     climbing to the top of the room. There are 30 floors of
     puzzles to solve in Ladder Man 1.


                   * Moving Ladder Man / Solving Room *

          You control the movements of Ladder Man by using the
     arrow keys.  Ladder Man is effected by gravity, so he needs to
     use his ladder to climb on to objects to reach his goals. The
     space bar activates his ladder which can only reach up two
     grids.  Using your problem solving skills, you must figure out
     how to grab all the diamonds located in each room. Once all
     the diamonds have been collected, a yellow bar will appear at
     the top of the screen. This yellow bar means that all the
     diamonds have been taken. Ladder Man must now climb to the top
     of the room and reach for the yellow bar allows him to exit 
     the puzzle.


                              * Objects *

          There are many objects located on each floor that can be
     used to help you complete each room. There are balls that you
     can push around to create steps for you to climb up on. There
     are Multi Blocks, Four Ball Holders, Gondolas, Fire Hydrants
     and more objects which will help you achieve the solution to
     the puzzle. These objects are demonstrated in the DEMO Program
     which can be selected at the Main Menu.  There are two hazards
     you must avoid, fire and water. If Ladder Man walks or falls
     into either of these, your attempt at the room will be over
     and you will be asked if you want to try the same room again.


                   * Personal Score Cards / Solutions *

          When you first play the game, you are asked to create
     your own score card. By entering your initials, you create a
     personal file that will keep track of the rooms you've solved
     and the number of attempts it took. If you complete a room and
     your number of moves was the lowest on record, then your
     solution to that room will be saved and you can play back your
     solution by starting the room over again and pressing the
     s<O>lution key. Only players that have completed the room will
     be allowed to see the solution.

     (The SOLUTION.DOC file describes how you can get our solutions
      to all the rooms Free!  See SOLUTION.DOC file for details.)


         There are many different strategies that you can use to
     solve these puzzles. If a floor seems to be giving you
     problems, go on to another one and come back to it later. You
     can access any of the 30 different rooms from the Main Menu.
     There is at least one solution for each floor.

                                 * DEMO *

          All the objects you can encounter on the different floors
     are described in the DEMO PROGRAM, which is accessed from the
     Main Menu.  If you are new to the game, this DEMO will take
     you through a puzzle room step by step so that you will
     understand the elements of the game.  It is STRONGLY
     RECOMMENDED to run the DEMO program when playing Ladder Man
     for the first time.



                            *  Key definitions  *


                   Arrow Keys = Move Ladder Man
                   Space Bar  = Put up ladder

          <Q>uit     =  Quits floor and takes you back to Main Menu
          <G>ive up  =  Used to attempt the floor over again
          <K>eys     =  Key definitions
          <S>ound    =  Sound toggle
          s<O>lution =  Plays back the solution to floor if you've
                        solved it or have sent in the Solution.doc
                        file to Soleau Software for the free
                        solutions to all floors.
                        (see SOLUTION.DOC file)



                          *  Important Note *

         It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that Ladder Man be put in a
     separate directory on your Hard Drive. Due to the graphics
     involved, the loading and exiting of the game will be
     considerably slower from a floppy disk. Ladder Man creates many
     files as you continue to play.  If playing from a low density 
     floppy disk, you might run out of room eventually, therefore you
     should either transfer the game to a HD disk or erase some of
     the document files included with the game.  Whether playing from a
     floppy disk or a Hard Drive, due to the number of files the
     game creates, you must locate the game in its own sub-directory.
