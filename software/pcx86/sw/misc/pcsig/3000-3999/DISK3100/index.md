Special Requirements: CGA or EGA and a hard drive.                      
                                                                        
TALKING ABCs teaches very young children the ABCs with arcade quality   
graphics and a digitized voice that actually talks over your computer's 
speaker. The program presents a picture of a beach and then a letter is 
displayed, "d" for example. The player presses the letter on the        
keyboard and a picture of an object that starts with that letter (dog)  
appears. The computer then speaks the word (dog). TALKING ABCs includes 
a couple of different variations to work on ABCs. This is a great       
educational game for preschoolers.
