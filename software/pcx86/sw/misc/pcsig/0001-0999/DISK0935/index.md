## Information about "MSPANTOC, BIBLIO, AND LIST-MRG"

    Writers -- here's a useful addition to your library.
    
    MSPANTOC reads a document you created on a wordprocessor and
    writes a new document, updated with:
    
    ~ Assigned section, paragraph, figure, and table numbers
    
    ~ Resolved cross references
    
    ~ A table of contents
    
    ~ A list of figures
    
    ~ A list of tables
    
    MSPANTOC is not a wordprocessor or an outline generator.  It complements
    your existing wordprocessing package by providing the numbering and
    cross-reference features not available with many current wordprocessing
    packages.  It works with WordStar, WordPerfect, or any other
    wordprocessor.
    File Descriptions:

    LIST-MGR searches for a text string or set of strings and selects
    records from a text file such as a list of addresses, clients,
    customers, members, etc.
    
    Each retrieved record can have up to five labeled fields (e.g., name,
    street, city-state-zip, expiration date, notes).  The number, length,
    or sequence of fields need not be the same for different records.
    
    You can send selected records to screen, printer, a new disk file, or
    any combination of these.  You can change the within-record field
    sequence in the output records, omitting some fields altogether if you
    want.
    
    Writers, Students, Editors -- BIBLIO will interest you.
    
    BIBLIO selects references from a pre-existing text file with a
    list of bibliographic references.  Each reference can have up to five
    labeled fields such as author, title, source, keywords, and notes.  The
    number, length, or sequence of fields need not be the same for different
    references.
    
    You can request selection of those references with a desired search
    phrase in a specified field.  You can send the output of the selected
    records to the screen, printer or disk.
