## Information about "MAHJONG"

    Run programs requiring a CGA card on a Hercules Graphics adapter.  This
    emulator allows such programs as PC-Paint, Printmaster, Flight
    Simulator and many others to run with no visible difference.
    
    MAHJONG is a Chinese gambling game which arrived in the West in the
    early 1920's.  The origin of the game is unclear but its development has
    touched on astrology, chess, gambling and, oddest of all, the Earth's
    magnetic field.
    
    It is a fast moving, dynamic game that becomes addictive with its
    excitement and intrigue.  The basic premise is a card game with 136
    cards (or "tiles" as they are called in MAHJONG) requiring both skill
    and luck.  Four players receive 13 tiles each and then pick up and
    discard tiles as they try to obtain four complete sets and a single pair
    of tiles.
    
    The game is interesting because of the many combinations possible and
    the skill required to increase your score.  To add further excitement,
    the fast pace provides little chance for contemplation -- thus
    developing an "instinct" rarely seen in other games.  Three levels of
    play are provided: beginner, advanced and professional.  An entertaining
    game for the whole family.
