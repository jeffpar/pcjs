## Information about "GENERAL LEDGER UK VERSION 1 OF 2 (809)"

    THE REMARKABLE GENERAL LEDGER allows you to set up and operate a
    complete General Ledger with a wide range of reports.  The program
    includes a Bank Information module with facilities for listing banks,
    reports on used and unused checks, and bank statement reconciliation.
    
    With TRGL you can print out reports on your transactions either in
    summary or in detail, on a leading or account level.  You can also
    print a trial balance and your chart of accounts.  A simple menu is
    offered that allows you to add, change, delete, or view your various
    entries made into your chart of accounts, journal, your record of bank
    deposits, and your checking account.  TRGL also has on-line help for
    every screen that requires input from the user.
    
    This system is designed to work for the UK and countries using
    currencies OTHER than the dollar.  (For countries using a dollar-based
    monetary system, please see PC-SIG #806 & #807.)
