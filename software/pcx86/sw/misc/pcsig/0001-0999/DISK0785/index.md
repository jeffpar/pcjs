## Information about "CHECKMATE-GL"

    Do you own a small business, or are you thinking of starting one -- only
    to be frightened by the thought of all the financial howmework you know
    it entails? If you want to keep track of your expenses and
    manage your finances wisely, you need an accountant -- or
    CHECKMATE-GL.
    
    CHECKMATE-GL is a powerful multiple-entry general ledger package that
    operates on the principles of classical accounting. CHECKMATE-GL has
    turned the complicated world of accounting into a user-friendly task,
    and even has an introduction to the basic principles of accounting for
    anyone unfamiliar with them.
    
    CHECKMATE-GL was designed to integrate with CHECKMATE, but does operate
    independently. The two programs have a unique interface, letting
    CHECKMATE become, in effect, a cash disbursements journal for
    CHECKMATE-GL. What is special about this is you can operate your day-
    to-day finances with CHECKMATE, and not worry about accounting or
    expensing your checks except at specific times. In this way you can
    separate your day-to-day finances from more critical accounting data.
    Home users will discover that you need only run CHECKMATE-GL once a week
    or so to quickly update your records. For businesses, personnel can
    work with CHECKMATE while you or your accounting professional can work
    exclusively with CHECKMATE-GL.
    
    CHECKMATE-GL can support up to 256 accounts simultaneously, and has
    powerful search-and-filter routines for all databases and reports.
    CHECKMATE-GL also has a user-friendly pull-down and pop-up menu system
    with on-line help. Included in this menu system is a pop-up chart of
    accounts for quick reference, and a pop-up accountant's calculator with
    rolling tape. The system allows for 50 predefined journal transactions
    that you can be call up at a keystroke. CHECKMATE-GL also has unique
    "quick-look" reports and flexible predefined reports with output
    control.
