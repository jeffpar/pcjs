## Information about "EASYMENU 1 OF 3 (ALSO 739, 740)"

    EASYMENU is a simple menu system with a few extra features that make
    your PC easier to use.  You record the commands you use to
    start an application, then let EASYMENU remember for you.  You can run
    any program at a keystroke or by clicking a mouse button.  It saves you
    time and keystrokes when you run your other computer programs, and lets
    you view useful notes and comments prior to running a program.  If you
    are new to computers, EASYMENU tells you about your computer hardware,
    amount of memory, number of access ports for printers and modems, the
    version of DOS you are using, and other useful information.  If you are
    more experienced, you might like to know that EASYMENU can run up to
    nine programs per menu, and that you can use batch files from within
    EASYMENU.
