## Information about "PROMENU AND PATCH AND OTHER UTILITIES"

    A memory-resident printer-control menu for Epson and compatible
    printers.
    
    PMENU3 gives you control codes, such as condensed, double strike, or
    underline, on command.  Once loaded, you can access PMENU3 while running
    your program and enter codes one at a time, or combinations of codes
    such as ``bold and italics''.
    
    Smarter than your average printing program, PMENU3 does not display or
    send conflicting codes to the printer, and can also be removed from
    memory.
    
    PATCH lets you view and modify disk files in memory or peruse and change
    the computer's memory as if it were a disk file.
    
    Display the contents of a file in memory, 256 bytes at a time.  Move
    around in the file, modify its contents, cancel modifications and search
    for specified strings.  Move immediately to the beginning or end of a
    file or jump to a portion of the file that is a certain offset, in
    bytes, from the beginning of the file.
    
    The file contents are displayed in both ASCII and hexadecimal.  You can
    do searches and modifications in either format.  Both formats of the
    file are viewed at the same time, with the hexadecimal on the left and
    the ASCII on the right.
    
    "Welcome Home" for the new baby, the traveller or the convalescent,
    "Sale Today" to boost your daily cash-flow, or "Hi Mom" from the
    football game. You can have them all and more with PC-BANNER.
    
    Here is a simple, menu-driven banner program that lets you change the
    style of print from light to dark. And it uses the IBM graphics
    character sets for high-quality banners.
    
    Here are a pair of protective utilities.
    
    SCRNOFF3 blanks your screen after three minutes of keyboard inactivity.
    This avoids etching your monitor.  Pressing any key brings the screen
    back into view.
    
    KYLOCK blanks your screen and locks the keyboard from others.  When the
    keyboard is locked, not even a Ctrl-Alt-Del routine reboots the
    computer.
