## Information about "GRAPHTIME II 2 OF 2 (ALSO 669)"

    GRAPHTIME-II is a business and technical graphics system with text and
    font editors.  Designed for use with dBASE II/III, Multiplan, Lotus 1-
    2-3 and ASCII files, it can also be used on its own with data entered
    from the keyboard into the built-in spreadsheet.  Epson compatible, HP
    Deskjet and Laserjet printers are supported.
    
    The package consists of six main modules:
    
    ~  GRAPH -- 19 types available with up to 10 graphs per screen
    
    ~  DRAW -- Full-screen color graphics editor
    
    ~  FONT -- Text generator and font editor
    
    ~  FILE -- External file input/output
    
    ~  TEXTED -- Text and macro editor
    
    ~  PRINT -- Printer driver
    
    The graphics editor can create free-form diagrams or enhance a
    previously made graph.  You can select arrow keys, joystick or mouse to
    control the graphics cursor.
    
    GRAPHTIME-II can be either menu or command-driven, with an emphasis on
    ease of use.  All scales and labels are made automatically with manual
    override.  A macro facility is included for commonly-used
    command sequences and to control slide shows.  Macros can also be
    created by recording a sequence of commands as they are used.
