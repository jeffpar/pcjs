## Information about "BOARD GAMES"

    A trio of classic board games.
    
    PC-PENTE is a game with its roots in the ancient game of Go.  The
    playing field is a grid and the object is simple: either get five of
    your pieces in a row or capture 10 of your opponent's pieces by
    surrounding them with your pieces.  It is assumed that you already know
    how to play the game, but in case you don't, Rules.com has a concise
    overview of the basic strategy of Pente.
    
    PYRAMIDS is a strategy game based on an ancient Egyptian theme.  You and
    the Pharaoh Cheops are vying to discover the other's pyramid before your
    own is found.  The playing pieces include sphinxes, lions, bulls, rams,
    wolves, hawks, camels, cats, antelopes and a cobra -- each with special
    powers.  You can see your opponent's pieces and your opponent can see
    yours, but you do not know the rank and power of each until one of you
    attacks the other.
    
    YAHTZEE is the classic dice game we've all played in which you try to
    collect pairs, three-of-a-kinds, full houses, and the like for points by
    rolling six dice.  From each roll, you can pick up from one to six of
    the dice and re-roll them, to try to better the score you receive for
    the roll.  Once a requirement has been filled, you cannot use that roll
    again.  The winner completes his list with the highest total score.
