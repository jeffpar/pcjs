## Information about "MINISTER ASSIGN PROGRAM"

    MINISTER helps you schedule readers, altar boys, communion ministers,
    head ushers, and greeters for the Catholic Mass.
    
    The scheduling process takes into account the preferences of the
    people scheduled, vacations, and assignments of other family members.
    The schedule is suitable for inclusion in the church bulletin. It can
    handle up to 600 people and any reasonable number of masses. Schedule
    Sunday masses, weekday masses, and special masses that appear on an
    irregular basis, such as Christmas and Easter.
    
    Schedule an additional minister-type schedule of your own definition.
    Display and print labels, phone lists for substitutes, or the entire
    database.
