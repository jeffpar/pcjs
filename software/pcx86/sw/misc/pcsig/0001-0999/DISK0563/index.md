## Information about "MAX - EMACS EDITOR"

    MAX is a freeware text editor that is a downsized version of the
    popular EMACS editor.  Down in size but not much in power!  It is
    quite fast and has some very powerful text-editing features.  If
    you have used the mainframe version, you'll feel right at home.
    The program is distributed in versions for both color and
    monochrome systems, and the source code is provided for the
    curious programmers among you.  However, for those not it that
    league, there is included an optional menu-driven interface for
    novices.
    
    Features:
    
    ~ Move by word, or globally
    ~ Search for text
    ~ Search and replace text by other text
    ~ Switch buffers
    ~ Multiple buffers and windows
    ~ Incremental search
    ~ Use windows or split screens (limited to 64K)
    ~ Give arguments to functions
    ~ Insert Control-Characters
    ~ Kill and yank back lines, words or regions
    ~ Format paragraphs
    ~ Define and invoke macro commands
    
    System Requirements: 128K, one disk drive and monochrome display
    
    How to Start:  NOTE: the Documentation, Color version and the Source
    code are all in separate subdirectories with their appropriate
    documentation files.  To run it, enter MAX and go for it!
    
    Suggested Registration:  $20.00 for individuals; $25.00 per copy for
    commercial and governmental sites.
