## Information about "CROSSWORD CREATOR"

    CROSSWORD CREATOR can be used by anyone who enjoys designing or solving
    crossword puzzles. It provides the tools you need to lay out a puzzle
    on the computer's screen, define clues for each word, save your design
    on disk, and produce professional-looking printouts of your crosswords.
    
    Enhancements include: 70 pages of context-sensitive available on-line,
    support for Wordfind (Castle Oaks Computing), desktop publishing
    conversion, support for all types of printers (including
    lasers), and an automatic word placement feature that will actually
    build a puzzle for you, using words you enter.
