## Information about "FAMILY TREE GENEALOGY"

    FAMILY TREE is a general purpose genealogy system designed for charting
    and maintaining family tree information and relationships between
    individuals.  The system is menu-driven with single-keystroke commands,
    scrolling, mini-windows, and output to screen, printer, or disk file.
    You can change default options to select disk drive, screen colors, and
    printer control codes.
    
    The maintenance function allows the entry of names, sex, dates/places
    of birth/death/marriage, and free-form text remarks.  Spouse and
    parent/child relationships are established after data is entered.
    
    The chart function uses the database to make reports by pedigree,
    ancestors, family groups, decendants, and relationships.
