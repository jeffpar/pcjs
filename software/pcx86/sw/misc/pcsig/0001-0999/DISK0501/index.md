## Information about "SALESEYE 1 OF 2 (ALSO 502)"

    The SALESEYE package is ideal for individuals in sales, because it is
    designed to help users keep track of prospects, leads, and those all-
    important memos.  It has a highly developed system of ``tickler'' files
    designed to keep track of deadlines, calls to be returned, lunch
    appointments, etc.  There is even a simple word processor, along
    commonly used letter formats.  This is disk one of a two disk set. The
    tutorial is on disk 502.
    
    System Requirements:  256K, two floppies or a hard disk, monochrome
    display.
    
    How to Start:  Read the README.1st file and then begin the Tutorial on
    Disk #502 by consulting the BEGINNIN.TXT for documentation.  To run,
    enter SELL and pressing <ENTER>.
    
    Suggested Registration:  To register this copy of SALESEYE and obtain a
    printed 240 page manual (includes a full Tutorial Manual, Reference
    Manual, Appendices, glossary and index), technical support, and
