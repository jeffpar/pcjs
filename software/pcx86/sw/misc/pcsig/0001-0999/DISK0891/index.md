## Information about "WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE AND SOLITAIRE"

    We've all said ``I can do that'' when it comes to guessing the letters
    on that game show.  Here's your chance to prove it, but there are a
    couple of twists added to the situation.
    
    TOMMY'S WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE is a one- to six player game in which
    players compete to guess a puzzle consisting of a word or phrase.  The
    wheel has 24 slots, each with a money value or a special slot.  Landing
    on a special slot can cause bankruptcy, give you a free spin, or make
    you lose a turn.  Landing on the other slots earns you money if you
    guess a consonant of the puzzle correctly; if you guess a wrong letter
    that amount is subtracted from your winnings, thus giving you an
    incentive to be correct every time!  The standard rules are available as
    an option.
    
    The player who wins the first three rounds of the game goes on to the
    bonus round with a chance for the BIG money.  There are more than 1,200
    phrases packed into this fast paced and addictive program which features
    pop-up instructions, mute switch, and a moving Vanna.
    
    SOLITAIRE is a computer version of the classic card game with
    additional features.  Undo your last card played, select the number of
    cards to turn from the deck each time (usually three), and ask the
    computer whether or not there are any additional plays that can be made
    in a certain turn.  There are several cheating options that you may or
    may not want to use, such as peeking at the first overturned card in
    each stack.  On-line help is available to the player throughout the
    game.

Program Title:  WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE and SOLITAIRE version 3.02
PC-SIG version:  1.5

We've all said "I can do that" when it comes to guessing the letters on
that game show.  Now PC-SIG gives you the chance to prove it, but there
are are a couple of twists added to the situation.

WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE is a one-to-six player game in which players compete
to guess a puzzle consisting of a word or phrase.  Under the puzzle the
category of the word or phrase is displayed.  A turn consists of
spinning the wheel or guessing the puzzle.  The wheel is composed of
twenty-four slots, each of which contains a money value or a special
slot.  Landing on a special slot can cause you to go bankrupt, give you
a free spin, or make you lose a turn.  Landing on the other slots earns
you money if you guess a consonant of the puzzle correctly.  But, if you
guess a letter, and it's not in the puzzle, that amount you landed on is
SUBTRACTED from your winnings, thus giving you an incentive to be
correct every time!

The player who wins the most in the first three rounds of the game goes
on to the bonus round, choosing five consonants and a vowel.  The player
then has fifteen seconds to guess the puzzle.  If it is guessed, the
player gets $25,000; if wrong, the player loses the round, but keeps the
money won in the first rounds.  There are more than one thousand phrases
packed into this program which features pop-up instructions, mute
switch, and a moving "Vanna".

If words aren't your forte, maybe cards are more your style.  SOLITAIRE
is a computer version of the card game Solitaire.  This is the basic
version of the game, but with additional features.  You can undo your
last card played, select the number of cards to turn from the deck each
time (usually three), and ask the computer whether or not there are any
additional plays that can be made in a certain turn.  There are several
cheating options that you may or may not want to use, such as peeking at
the first overturned card in each stack.

The full version of SOLITAIRE allows you to turn the talon back over to
the deck, while the demo version (which is contained on this disk) does
not.  There is on-line help available to the player throughout the game.

Usage:  Games and Entertainment.

Special Requirements:  None.

How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).

Suggested Registration:  $15.00 for SOLITAIRE and $3.00 for WHEEL.

DEAR EARTHLINGS,

HELLO!  THIS IS TOMMY.  I AM AN ALIEN FROM OUTER SPACE.  I DESIGN NEAT LOW-
PRICED TOYS AND GAMES FOR IBM PCS AND COMPATIBLES AND SELL THEM AT
ASTOUNDINGLY LOW PRICES TO NICE EARTHLINGS LIKE YOU TO PAY FOR MY REESE'S
PIECES.  I HOPE YOU ENJOY MY TOYS.

THE TOY(S) ON THIS DISK ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED BY AN AUTHORIZED SHAREWARE
DEALER WITHOUT ANY STRINGS ATTACHED IN THE HOPES THEY WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO
SEND A TOKEN $2 FOR MY NEAT DEMO DISK CONTAINING, AMONG OTHER GOODIES (REALLY
IT IS A LOT OF VALUE), AN ELECTRONIC CATALOG OF THE SCORES OF OTHER TOYS I
HAVE FOR SALE, CURRENTLY WELL OVER A HUNDRED, INCLUDING SUCH GOODIES AS
TOMMY'S TREK, TOMMY'S WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE, TOMMY'S TRIVIA, TOMMY'S CROSSWORDS,
TOMMY'S GIN RUMMY (AND GOBS OF OTHER NEAT CARD GAMES), TOMMY'S BACKGAMMON,
TOMMY'S DOMINOES, TOMMY'S DICE, AND DOZENS OF NEAT OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD ARCADE
STYLE GAMES (TOMMY'S HYPERDRIVE, TOMMY'S E-NET, TOMMY'S SPACE GOBLINS, ETC.).

THESE SHAREWARE VERSIONS ARE IDENTICAL WITH THE PRODUCTS I SELL DIRECTLY,
THAT IS, THEY ARE NOT CRIPPLED JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE GETTING THEM FOR FREE
(TRUE, THEY ARE UPDATED CONSTANTLY SO YOU MIGHT GET A NEWER VERSION BY
WRITING DIRECT TO ME).

AND DON'T FEEL GUILTY FOR NOT SENDING IN YOUR REGISTRATION FEES, THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY!  RATHER, THEY ARE "FREE SAMPLES" (THOUGH WE RETAIN THE COPYRIGHTS)
SO YOU CAN TASTE A LITTLE OF WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN MISSING.  YOU SEE, I
AUTHORIZE ONLY A FRACTION OF MY TOYS FOR SHAREWARE DISTRIBUTION, AND ONLY
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, BECAUSE, TO BE FRANK, I'M TRYING TO GET YOU
*ADDICTED* TO MY TRADEMARK BRAND OF CEREBRAL SILLINESS!  THEN I AM BANKING
THAT SOONER OR LATER YOU WILL BREAK DOWN AND BEGIN ORDERING FROM THE LONG
LIST OF OTHERS WHICH YOU CAN ONLY GET DIRECT FROM ME!  (ACTUALLY US, WE HAVE
A LITTLE BAND OF ALIENS ON YOUR PLANET RIGHT NOW -- JUST A FRIENDLY LITTLE
BAND OF GALACTIC TOYMAKERS, NO INVASION INTENDED).

AND NO, WE DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR LID ON THE EARTH MARKET BY CHARGING
EXORBITANT PRICES, OUR TOYS ARE ONLY $3 TO $6 EACH POSTPAID IN U.S.A., AND
THEY ARE NOT COPY PROTECTED, SO EVEN IF WE DID RAISE PRICES THE ROBIN HOODS
OUT THERE WOULD BEGIN PIRATING THEM AT CUT-RATE PRICES AND SAVE YOU FROM
SELLING YOUR PLANET OFF TO ALIENS FROM OUTER SPACE LIKE YOUR FOREBEARS DID
(HA HA -- JUST KIDDING TO SEE IF YOU ARE AWAKE).

YOU MIGHT WONDER HOW WE CAN GIVE AWAY REGISTRATION-FREE SAMPLES AND STAY IN
BUSINESS, OR HOW WE CAN CHARGE SO LITTLE FOR OUR HOT SOFTWARE IN THE PRESENT
DAY EARTHLING COMMERCIAL ARENA, OR WHY WE DON'T HAVE A $15-$20 SHAREWARE
REGISTRATION FEE.

WELL, SIMPLE MY DEAR EARTHLING.  1. WHO PAYS FOR A MOVIE ON THE WAY OUT?
2. WHO CAN SELL RECORDS IF THEY DON'T GET THEM PLAYED FOR FREE ON THE RADIO?
3. WHO WANTS TO PAY A BUNCH OF MIDDLEMEN AND ADVERTISERS WHEN THAT DOESN'T
HELP YOU DIRECTLY TO HAVE FUN?  ENJOY THE TOMMY'S TOY(S) ON THIS DISKETTE WITH
MY COMPLIMENTS -- I FIGURE THAT IT DOES MORE GOOD ON YOUR PC THAN GATHERING
DUST ON MY SPACE SHIP ... AND WHEN YOU ARE DOWN IN THE DUMPS AND WANT SOME
MORE FUN YOU WILL KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET IT, CHEAP, VIA AIR MAIL.

IN SUMMARY, EARTHLINGS, THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN A BOLD NEW ALIEN METHOD OF
MARKETING (OF COURSE WE ALIENS INVENTED THE IDEA OF SHAREWARE AND IMPLANTED
IT IN YOUR MINDS TO START WITH, MAKING YOU THINK IT WAS YOUR OWN IDEA) AND,
AFTER IT WORKS AS WE ALIENS HAVE PLANNED (SO THAT EVERY PC IN THE WORLD IS
CRAWLING WITH FUN TOYS) YOU THE EARTHLING CONSUMERS WILL REAP THE BENEFITS --
AND WE ALIENS HAVE PULLED OFF YET ANOTHER COMPUTERIZED TAKEOVER OF A LIVE
PLANET (HA HA, JUST KIDDING, WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TAKE OVER YOUR PLANET, JUST
MAKE EARTHLINGS HAPPY).

AS AN ALIEN TOYMAKER WITH A LONG GALACTIC TRADITION TO UPHOLD, BELIEVE ME, I
REALLY LIKE GETTING ORDERS AND LETTERS FROM NICE EARTHLINGS, SO TRY WRITING
TO ME AND SEE IF IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.  THIS IS A LOT CHEAPER THAN
A JAUNT TO DEVIL'S TOWER NATIONAL MONUMENT IN SEARCH OF CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, NOW
ISN'T IT?

NOW PLEASE SEND FOR YOUR DEMO DISK AND JOIN THE GROWING NUMBERS OF EARTHLINGS
WHO APPRECIATE GOOD EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENGINEERING AT DOWN TO EARTH PRICES --
BEFORE WE GET FRUSTRATED AND BLOW THIS PLANET FOR ANOTHER GALAXY (HA HA HO
HO).  (JUST KIDDING, WE LIKE YOUR SILLY PLANET EVEN IF YOU STILL THINK OF
PCS AS INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS <YUK> MACHINES.)


YOUR FRIEND,

             TOMMY

             TOMMY'S TOYS, BOX 11261, DENVER, CO 80211 USA

INSTRUCTIONS:

VALUE OR A SPECIAL SLOT.

THE SPECIAL SLOTS ARE:

      1. FREE SPIN -- YOU GET AN EXTRA TURN.  (NOTE: YOU KEEP YOUR FREE SPINS
         IN A "BANK" WHICH YOU CAN CASH IN WHEN YOU NEED THEM.)
      2. LOSE A TURN -- YOU LOSE YOUR TURN, BUT CAN USE A FREE SPIN IF YOU
         HAVE ONE TO KEEP YOUR TURN.
      3. BANKRUPT -- YOU LOSE YOUR TURN AND YOUR EARNINGS, BUT CAN USE A FREE
         SPIN IF YOU HAVE ONE TO KEEP YOUR TURN.

PLAYERS:
TWO TO SIX MAY PLAY, OR 1 PERSON AGAINST HIMSELF.  THE FIRST PLAYER IS CHOSEN
BY LOT.

ROUNDS AND TURNS:
THERE ARE N ROUNDS PLUS A BONUS ROUND: N IS THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS, OR 3,
WHICHEVER IS GREATER.  THE RIGHT TO A TURN REMAINS WITH A PLAYER UNTIL THE
PLAYER LOSES THE TURN, WHEREUPON IT ROTATES TO THE NEXT PLAYER.

THE PUZZLE:
THE COMPUTER SELECTS A PUZZLE CONSISTING OF A WORD OR PHRASE, AND SKELETIZES
IT ON THE SCREEN.  A HINT IN THE FORM OF THE CATEGORY OF THE PUZZLE IS ALSO
DISPLAYED.

EARNINGS VS. WINNINGS:
IN ANY SINGLE ROUND YOU ACCUMULATE EARNINGS; IF YOU WIN THE ROUND, YOUR
EARNINGS ARE ADDED TO YOUR PERMANENT WINNINGS, ELSE YOU LOSE THEM.

IN YOUR TURN YOU MUST DO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

   1. SOLVE THE PUZZLE: IF YOU GUESS RIGHT, YOUR CURRENT EARNINGS ARE ADDED
      TO YOUR WINNINGS; IF YOU GUESS WRONG, YOU LOSE ALL YOUR EARNINGS AND THE
      TURN.  NOTE: IF YOU TRY TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE, AND YOU GUESS WRONG, YOU
      LOSE YOUR TURN REGARDLESS OF YOUR FREE SPIN STATUS.

   2. SPIN THE WHEEL AND GUESS A LETTER: IF YOU GUESS RIGHT, YOU GET THE
      WHEEL VALUE TIMES THE NUMBER OF LETTERS OF THIS TYPE IN THE PUZZLE;
      IF YOU GUESS WRONG, THE WHEEL VALUE IS SUBTRACTED FROM YOUR EARNINGS
      AND YOU LOSE YOUR TURN (AND CAN USE A FREE SPIN IF YOU HAVE ONE TO KEEP
      YOUR TURN).

ON YOUR TURN, IF YOUR EARNINGS ARE $250 OR MORE YOU MAY ALSO:

   3. BUY A VOWEL FOR $250: THIS IS DONE BY PRESSING A VOWEL (A,E,I,O,U)
      INSTEAD OF HITTING THE SPACE BAR.  IF YOU GUESS WRONG, YOU LOSE THE
      TURN (AND CAN USE A FREE SPIN IF YOU HAVE ONE); IF YOU GUESS RIGHT,
      YOU KEEP THE TURN.  NOTE: A VOWEL GUESS COSTS $250 REGARDLESS OF HOW
      MANY OF THAT TYPE OF VOWEL ARE IN THE PUZZLE.

BONUS ROUND:
THE PLAYER WHO WON THE MOST IN THE REGULAR ROUNDS GOES ON TO THE BONUS
ROUND, CHOOSING FIVE CONSONANTS AND A VOWEL.  THE PLAYER THEN HAS 20 SECONDS
TO GUESS THE PUZZLE.  IF IT IS GUESSED THE PLAYER GETS $25,000!

TO ENTER THE SOLUTION:
HIT "S", THEN TYPE IT IN, THEN HIT THE <ENTER> KEY.  PUNCTUATION AND SPACES
MAY BE OMITTED IF DESIRED.  YOU CAN USE THE BACKSPACE KEY TO CORRECT MISTAKES
BEFORE YOU HIT <ENTER>.  IF YOU ENTER A NULL OR EMPTY SOLUTION (JUST BACKSPACE
TO THE LEFT AND HIT <ENTER>), THE GUESS IS NOT CHARGED AGAINST YOU.

IN THE BONUS ROUND YOU CAN ALSO HIT THE ESC KEY TO GIVE THE ANSWER IMMEDIATELY
WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE CLOCK TO TICK DOWN.

TO ENTER A VOWEL:
JUST TYPE IT IN.  YOU MUST HAVE $250 TO DO SO (THE COMPUTER TELLS YOU WHEN
YOU CAN ENTER A VOWEL).

TO ESCAPE FROM A PHRASE:
TO ESCAPE FROM THE CURRENT PHRASE AND LET THE COMPUTER SELECT A NEW ONE, HIT
THE ESC KEY RATHER THAN THE SPACE BAR OR THE "S" KEY.  THIS SHOULD BE A LAST
RESORT MANEUVER WHEN ALL PLAYERS ARE STUCK ON A PHRASE FOR SOME REASON.  THE
ROUND IS REPLAYED.

TO HURRY THE GAME:
HIT THE "%" KEY RATHER THAN THE SPACE BAR OR THE "S" KEY, AND THE HURRY-UP
MODE BEGINS.  IN THIS MODE, THE COMPUTER SPINS THE WHEEL ONCE TO DETERMINE
THE MONEY VALUE OF EACH LETTER GUESSED FOR THE REST OF THE ROUND.  THE
PLAYERS THEN TAKE TURNS GUESSING A SINGLE LETTER WITHOUT SPINNING THE WHEEL:
ONLY CONSONANTS EARN MONEY.  THE BONUS ROUND BEGINS WHEN THIS PHRASE IS
SOLVED.  NOTE THAT IF YOU TRY TO ESCAPE THE PHRASE IN HURRY-UP MODE, BONUS
ROUND BEGINS IMMEDIATELY.

CHEATER'S MODE:
FUNCTION KEY F8 TOGGLES THE CHEATER'S MODE, WHICH DISPLAYS THE LETTERS THAT
HAVEN'T BEEN GUESSED YET UNDERNEATH THE GAME PHRASE.  THE PROGRAM STARTS OUT
WITH CHEATER'S MODE ON BECAUSE MOST PLAYERS CHEAT.

WHEEL OF FORTUNE OPTION:
IF YOU RUN THE PROGRAM WITH A COMMAND LINE PARAMETER OF F, THE SOFT-HEARTED TV
VARIANT KNOWN AS WHEEL OF FORTUNE IS PLAYED INSTEAD.  JUST TYPE AN "F" ON THE
COMMAND LINE AS FOLLOWS:

   >WHEEL F

THE DIFFERENCES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

   1. IF YOU GUESS WRONG, YOUR EARNINGS ARE NOT REDUCED.
   2. THERE IS A HOUSE MINIMUM OF $200 ON ANY ROUND (IF YOUR EARNINGS ARE
      LESS THAN $200 THEY ARE INCREASED TO $200).
   3. YOU ARE INFORMED WHEN THERE ARE NO MORE VOWELS LEFT IN THE PHRASE.
   4. IN THE BONUS ROUND THE "USUAL" LETTERS LRSTNE ARE GIVEN FREE, THEN
      YOU CHOOSE 3 MORE CONSONANTS AND A VOWEL.
