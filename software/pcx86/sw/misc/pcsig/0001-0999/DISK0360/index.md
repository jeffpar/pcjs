## Information about "PFROI, PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT WITH ROI"

    Now you can track your investments daily.  How often have you analyzed
    just how much of an increase, (or, sadly, a decrease), from the
    original cost, that daily value represents?  PFROI helps you to
    maintain and manage a securities (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, CDs,
    etc.) portfolio and periodically measure the return on investment.
    
    Several reports and analyses are available: gains, dividends, interest,
    miscellaneous income, open lots, transactions, account position,
    relative strength, valuation plot, portfolio ROI, security ROI and
    client statement.  Focus on those marginal investments in order to make
    well-informed GO/NO GO decisions.  PFROI does not download electronic
    stock data.  A demonstration data file is included.
    
    Manage an extensive portfolio and plan and prepare your taxes.
