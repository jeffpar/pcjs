## Information about "GREETINGWARE CHRISTMAS AND BIRTHDAY"

    This is one greeting card that won't get thrown in a shoebox after the
    occasion is over. Just think of the fun your friends and relatives will
    have when they receive a customized birthday or Christmas card-on-a-disk
    from you!
    
    GREETINGWARE's CHRISTMAS MEDLEY and BIRTHDAY MEDLEY will let you send a
    musical and colorful electronic greeting card. The Christmas card
    entertains you with a Christmas tree with flashing lights, while the
    birthday card greets you with a cake and candles.
    
    Each card plays six songs, which your family and friends can sing along
    with. The program will put the words on the screen and then... just
    follow the bouncing ball.
