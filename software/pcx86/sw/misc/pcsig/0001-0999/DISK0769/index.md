    This disk is part of a seven-disk set with the entire King James version
    of the Bible.  It is in text file format, making it easy to locate
    verses, add passages into documents, or prepare manuscript studies.
    
    Since it is all ASCII text files, each book is a separate file.  When
    you get the disks, the files are archived, or ``squeezed'', so you must
    first unsqueeze them onto either 19 other 360K floppies or onto your
    hard drive.  Be advised that some books of the Bible are too long to fit
    into some wordprocessors that limit the size of documents to the amount
    of available RAM.
    
    To view or search these files, you need to use a wordprocessor or some
    kind of viewing shell.  No such program is provided on this disk.

ECC 1:1  The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

ECC 1:2  Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is
 vanity.

ECC 1:3  What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the
 sun?

ECC 1:4  One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the
 earth abideth for ever.

ECC 1:5  The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place
 where he arose.

ECC 1:6  The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it
 whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his
 circuits.

ECC 1:7  All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the
 place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

ECC 1:8  All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not
 satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

ECC 1:9  The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is
 done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.

ECC 1:10  Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath
 been already of old time, which was before us.

ECC 1:11  There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any
 remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.

ECC 1:12  I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

ECC 1:13  And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all
 things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the
 sons of man to be exercised therewith.

ECC 1:14  I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold,
 all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

ECC 1:15  That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is
 wanting cannot be numbered.

ECC 1:16  I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
 estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in
 Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.

ECC 1:17  And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I
 perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

ECC 1:18  For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge
 increaseth sorrow.

ECC 2:1  I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with
 mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.

ECC 2:2  I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

ECC 2:3  I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine
 heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that
 good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days
 of their life.

ECC 2:4  I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:

ECC 2:5  I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all
 kind of fruits:

ECC 2:6  I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth
 forth trees:

ECC 2:7  I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also
 I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in
 Jerusalem before me:

ECC 2:8  I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings
 and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the
 delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.

ECC 2:9  So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
 Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

ECC 2:10  And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not
 my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was
 my portion of all my labour.

ECC 2:11  Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the
 labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of
 spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.

ECC 2:12  And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for
 what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been
 already done.

ECC 2:13  Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth
 darkness.

ECC 2:14  The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
 darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.

ECC 2:15  Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth
 even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this
 also is vanity.

ECC 2:16  For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for
 ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten.
 And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.

ECC 2:17  Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the
 sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

ECC 2:18  Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I
 should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

ECC 2:19  And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall
 he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have
 shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.

ECC 2:20  Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour
 which I took under the sun.

ECC 2:21  For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and
 in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for
 his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.

ECC 2:22  For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his
 heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?

ECC 2:23  For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart
 taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

ECC 2:24  There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
 drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I
 saw, that it was from the hand of God.

ECC 2:25  For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?

ECC 2:26  For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
 knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to
 heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity
 and vexation of spirit.

ECC 3:1  To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under
 the heaven:

ECC 3:2  A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to
 pluck up that which is planted;

ECC 3:3  A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time
 to build up;

ECC 3:4  A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to
 dance;

ECC 3:5  A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a
 time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;

ECC 3:6  A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast
 away;

ECC 3:7  A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time
 to speak;

ECC 3:8  A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of
 peace.

ECC 3:9  What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

ECC 3:10  I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to
 be exercised in it.

ECC 3:11  He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the
 world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh
 from the beginning to the end.

ECC 3:12  I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and
 to do good in his life.

ECC 3:13  And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of
 all his labour, it is the gift of God.

ECC 3:14  I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can
 be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should
 fear before him.

ECC 3:15  That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already
 been; and God requireth that which is past.

ECC 3:16  And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
 wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was
 there.

ECC 3:17  I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked:
 for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.

ECC 3:18  I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that
 God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are
 beasts.

ECC 3:19  For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one
 thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have
 all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is
 vanity.

ECC 3:20  All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust
 again.

ECC 3:21  Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit
 of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

ECC 3:22  Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man
 should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring
 him to see what shall be after him?

ECC 4:1  So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under
 the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no
 comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had
 no comforter.

ECC 4:2  Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the
 living which are yet alive.

ECC 4:3  Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath
 not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

ECC 4:4  Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a
 man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

ECC 4:5  The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

ECC 4:6  Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with
 travail and vexation of spirit.

ECC 4:7  Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

ECC 4:8  There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither
 child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye
 satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my
 soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.

ECC 4:9  Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their
 labour.

ECC 4:10  For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him
 that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.

ECC 4:11  Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be
 warm alone?

ECC 4:12  And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a
 threefold cord is not quickly broken.

ECC 4:13  Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who
 will no more be admonished.

ECC 4:14  For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in
 his kingdom becometh poor.

ECC 4:15  I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second
 child that shall stand up in his stead.

ECC 4:16  There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before
 them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is
 vanity and vexation of spirit.

ECC 5:1  Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready
 to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they
 do evil.

ECC 5:2  Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter
 any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore
 let thy words be few.

ECC 5:3  For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's
 voice is known by multitude of words.

ECC 5:4  When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no
 pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

ECC 5:5  Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow
 and not pay.

ECC 5:6  Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou
 before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy
 voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?

ECC 5:7  For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers
 vanities: but fear thou God.

ECC 5:8  If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of
 judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is
 higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.

ECC 5:9  Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is
 served by the field.

ECC 5:10  He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that
 loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

ECC 5:11  When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good
 is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?

ECC 5:12  The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much:
 but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.

ECC 5:13  There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches
 kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

ECC 5:14  But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and
 there is nothing in his hand.

ECC 5:15  As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as
 he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his
 hand.

ECC 5:16  And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall
 he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?

ECC 5:17  All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and
 wrath with his sickness.

ECC 5:18  Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat
 and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under
 the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his
 portion.

ECC 5:19  Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath
 given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in
 his labour; this is the gift of God.

ECC 5:20  For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God
 answereth him in the joy of his heart.

ECC 6:1  There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common
 among men:

ECC 6:2  A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he
 wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not
 power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an
 evil disease.

ECC 6:3  If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the
 days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also
 that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.

ECC 6:4  For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name
 shall be covered with darkness.

ECC 6:5  Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more
 rest than the other.

ECC 6:6  Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no
 good: do not all go to one place?

ECC 6:7  All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not
 filled.

ECC 6:8  For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that
 knoweth to walk before the living?

ECC 6:9  Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this
 is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

ECC 6:10  That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is
 man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.

ECC 6:11  Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the
 better?

ECC 6:12  For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of
 his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what
 shall be after him under the sun?

ECC 7:1  A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death
 than the day of one's birth.

ECC 7:2  It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house
 of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to
 his heart.

ECC 7:3  Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance
 the heart is made better.

ECC 7:4  The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of
 fools is in the house of mirth.

ECC 7:5  It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear
 the song of fools.

ECC 7:6  For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the
 fool: this also is vanity.

ECC 7:7  Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
 heart.

ECC 7:8  Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the
 patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

ECC 7:9  Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom
 of fools.

ECC 7:10  Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than
 these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.

ECC 7:11  Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them
 that see the sun.

ECC 7:12  For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency
 of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.

ECC 7:13  Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he
 hath made crooked?

ECC 7:14  In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity
 consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that
 man should find nothing after him.

ECC 7:15  All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man
 that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that
 prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

ECC 7:16  Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why
 shouldest thou destroy thyself ?

ECC 7:17  Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou
 die before thy time?

ECC 7:18  It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this
 withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them
 all.

ECC 7:19  Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are
 in the city.

ECC 7:20  For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth
 not.

ECC 7:21  Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy
 servant curse thee:

ECC 7:22  For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself
 likewise hast cursed others.

ECC 7:23  All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was
 far from me.

ECC 7:24  That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?

ECC 7:25  I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
 wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even
 of foolishness and madness:

ECC 7:26  And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares
 and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her;
 but the sinner shall be taken by her.

ECC 7:27  Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one,
 to find out the account:

ECC 7:28  Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand
 have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.

ECC 7:29  Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they
 have sought out many inventions.

ECC 8:1  Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing?
 a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall
 be changed.

ECC 8:2  I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard
 of the oath of God.

ECC 8:3  Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for
 he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

ECC 8:4  Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him,
 What doest thou?

ECC 8:5  Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise
 man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

ECC 8:6  Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the
 misery of man is great upon him.

ECC 8:7  For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it
 shall be?

ECC 8:8  There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit;
 neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that
 war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.

ECC 8:9  All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is
 done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to
 his own hurt.

ECC 8:10  And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place
 of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this
 is also vanity.

ECC 8:11  Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
 speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do
 evil.

ECC 8:12  Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged,
 yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear
 before him:

ECC 8:13  But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong
 his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.

ECC 8:14  There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just
 men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there
 be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I
 said that this also is vanity.

ECC 8:15  Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the
 sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with
 him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.

ECC 8:16  When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business
 that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night
 seeth sleep with his eyes:)

ECC 8:17  Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the
 work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out,
 yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it,
 yet shall he not be able to find it.

ECC 9:1  For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that
 the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man
 knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.

ECC 9:2  All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and
 to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that
 sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the
 sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.

ECC 9:3  This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that
 there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full
 of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they
 go to the dead.

ECC 9:4  For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a
 living dog is better than a dead lion.

ECC 9:5  For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any
 thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is
 forgotten.

ECC 9:6  Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;
 neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under
 the sun.

ECC 9:7  Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry
 heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

ECC 9:8  Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.

ECC 9:9  Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life
 of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy
 vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou
 takest under the sun.

ECC 9:10  Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is
 no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou
 goest.

ECC 9:11  I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
 nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches
 to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance
 happeneth to them all.

ECC 9:12  For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an
 evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of
 men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.

ECC 9:13  This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto
 me:

ECC 9:14  There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a
 great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:

ECC 9:15  Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom
 delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.

ECC 9:16  Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor
 man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

ECC 9:17  The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him
 that ruleth among fools.

ECC 9:18  Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much
 good.

ECC 10:1  Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a
 stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom
 and honour.

ECC 10:2  A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his
 left.

ECC 10:3  Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom
 faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.

ECC 10:4  If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place;
 for yielding pacifieth great offences.

ECC 10:5  There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which
 proceedeth from the ruler:

ECC 10:6  Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

ECC 10:7  I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants
 upon the earth.

ECC 10:8  He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an
 hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

ECC 10:9  Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth
 wood shall be endangered thereby.

ECC 10:10  If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put
 to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

ECC 10:11  Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is
 no better.

ECC 10:12  The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool
 will swallow up himself.

ECC 10:13  The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end
 of his talk is mischievous madness.

ECC 10:14  A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and
 what shall be after him, who can tell him?

ECC 10:15  The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he
 knoweth not how to go to the city.

ECC 10:16  Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat
 in the morning!

ECC 10:17  Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and
 thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!

ECC 10:18  By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness
 of the hands the house droppeth through.

ECC 10:19  A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
 answereth all things.

ECC 10:20  Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in
 thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which
 hath wings shall tell the matter.

ECC 11:1  Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many
 days.

ECC 11:2  Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what
 evil shall be upon the earth.

ECC 11:3  If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth:
 and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place
 where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

ECC 11:4  He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the
 clouds shall not reap.

ECC 11:5  As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones
 do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the
 works of God who maketh all.

ECC 11:6  In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine
 hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or
 whether they both shall be alike good.

ECC 11:7  Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to
 behold the sun:

ECC 11:8  But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him
 remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is
 vanity.

ECC 11:9  Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee
 in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the
 sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring
 thee into judgment.

ECC 11:10  Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy
 flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.

ECC 12:1  Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil
 days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no
 pleasure in them;

ECC 12:2  While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
 darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:

ECC 12:3  In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the
 strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are
 few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,

ECC 12:4  And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the
 grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the
 daughters of musick shall be brought low;

ECC 12:5  Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall
 be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall
 be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and
 the mourners go about the streets:

ECC 12:6  Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or
 the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.

ECC 12:7  Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit
 shall return unto God who gave it.

ECC 12:8  Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.

ECC 12:9  And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the
 people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order
 many proverbs.

ECC 12:10  The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was
 written was upright, even words of truth.

ECC 12:11  The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the
 masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.

ECC 12:12  And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books
 there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.

ECC 12:13  Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep
 his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

ECC 12:14  For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret
 thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

EST 1:1  Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which
 reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty
 provinces:)

EST 1:2  That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his
 kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,

EST 1:3  In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes
 and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes
 of the provinces, being before him:

EST 1:4  When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of
 his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.

EST 1:5  And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the
 people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small,
 seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;

EST 1:6  Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of
 fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of
 gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black,
 marble.

EST 1:7  And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being
 diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the
 state of the king.

EST 1:8  And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the
 king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do
 according to every man's pleasure.

EST 1:9  Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house
 which belonged to king Ahasuerus.

EST 1:10  On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine,
 he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and
 Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the
 king,

EST 1:11  To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to
 shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.

EST 1:12  But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his
 chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.

EST 1:13  Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was
 the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:

EST 1:14  And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish,
 Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw
 the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)

EST 1:15  What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she
 hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?

EST 1:16  And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the
 queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and
 to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.

EST 1:17  For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that
 they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported,
 The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him,
 but she came not.

EST 1:18  Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all
 the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall
 there arise too much contempt and wrath.

EST 1:19  If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and
 let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be
 not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king
 give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.

EST 1:20  And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published
 throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give
 to their husbands honour, both to great and small.

EST 1:21  And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did
 according to the word of Memucan:

EST 1:22  For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every
 province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their
 language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it
 should be published according to the language of every people.

EST 2:1  After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he
 remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.

EST 2:2  Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be
 fair young virgins sought for the king:

EST 2:3  And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom,
 that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the
 palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's
 chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be
 given them:

EST 2:4  And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti.
 And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.

EST 2:5  Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was
 Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;

EST 2:6  Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had
 been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king
 of Babylon had carried away.

EST 2:7  And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for
 she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom
 Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.

EST 2:8  So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was
 heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace,
 to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house,
 to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.

EST 2:9  And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he
 speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged
 to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's
 house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house
 of the women.

EST 2:10  Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had
 charged her that she should not shew it.

EST 2:11  And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house,
 to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.

EST 2:12  Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after
 that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for
 so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with
 oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the
 purifying of the women;)

EST 2:13  Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was
 given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.

EST 2:14  In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the
 second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's
 chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more,
 except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.

EST 2:15  Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
 Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the
 king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper
 of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them
 that looked upon her.

EST 2:16  So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the
 tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.

EST 2:17  And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace
 and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal
 crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.

EST 2:18  Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
 servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and
 gave gifts, according to the state of the king.

EST 2:19  And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then
 Mordecai sat in the king's gate.

EST 2:20  Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had
 charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was
 brought up with him.

EST 2:21  In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the
 king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were
 wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.

EST 2:22  And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the
 queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.

EST 2:23  And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
 therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book
 of the chronicles before the king.

EST 3:1  After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
 Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the
 princes that were with him.

EST 3:2  And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and
 reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai
 bowed not, nor did him reverence.

EST 3:3  Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto
 Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?

EST 3:4  Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened
 not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would
 stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.

EST 3:5  And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him
 reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.

EST 3:6  And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had
 shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the
 Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of
 Mordecai.

EST 3:7  In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of
 king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to
 day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.

EST 3:8  And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
 scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy
 kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the
 king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.

EST 3:9  If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed:
 and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have
 the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.

EST 3:10  And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the
 son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.

EST 3:11  And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people
 also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.

EST 3:12  Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the
 first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded
 unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every
 province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according
 to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name
 of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.

EST 3:13  And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to
 destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old,
 little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the
 twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a
 prey.

EST 3:14  The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
 province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against
 that day.

EST 3:15  The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the
 decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to
 drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.

EST 4:1  When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
 clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the
 city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;

EST 4:2  And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the
 king's gate clothed with sackcloth.

EST 4:3  And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his
 decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and
 weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.

EST 4:4  So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was
 the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and
 to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.

EST 4:5  Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he
 had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to
 know what it was, and why it was.

EST 4:6  So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which
 was before the king's gate.

EST 4:7  And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the
 sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for
 the Jews, to destroy them.

EST 4:8  Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given
 at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto
 her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make
 supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.

EST 4:9  And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.

EST 4:10  Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
 Mordecai;

EST 4:11  All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do
 know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the king into the
 inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death,
 except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may
 live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.

EST 4:12  And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.

EST 4:13  Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that
 thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.

EST 4:14  For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall
 there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but
 thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou
 art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?

EST 4:15  Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,

EST 4:16  Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and
 fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also
 and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which
 is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.

EST 4:17  So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had
 commanded him.

EST 5:1  Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal
 apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the
 king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over
 against the gate of the house.

EST 5:2  And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the
 court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther
 the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the
 top of the sceptre.

EST 5:3  Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is
 thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.

EST 5:4  And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and
 Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.

EST 5:5  Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as
 Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had
 prepared.

EST 5:6  And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy
 petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the
 half of the kingdom it shall be performed.

EST 5:7  Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;

EST 5:8  If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the
 king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman
 come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as
 the king hath said.

EST 5:9  Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when
 Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for
 him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.

EST 5:10  Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent
 and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.

EST 5:11  And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of
 his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how
 he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.

EST 5:12  Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in
 with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to
 morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.

EST 5:13  Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew
 sitting at the king's gate.

EST 5:14  Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows
 be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that
 Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto
 the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be
 made.

EST 6:1  On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the
 book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.

EST 6:2  And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and
 Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought
 to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

EST 6:3  And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai
 for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is
 nothing done for him.

EST 6:4  And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the
 outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on
 the gallows that he had prepared for him.

EST 6:5  And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the
 court. And the king said, Let him come in.

EST 6:6  So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto
 the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart,
 To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?

EST 6:7  And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to
 honour,

EST 6:8  Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the
 horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his
 head:

EST 6:9  And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the
 king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king
 delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the
 city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king
 delighteth to honour.

EST 6:10  Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the
 horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at
 the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.

EST 6:11  Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and
 brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed
 before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to
 honour.

EST 6:12  And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his
 house mourning, and having his head covered.

EST 6:13  And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that
 had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If
 Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall,
 thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.

EST 6:14  And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's
 chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had
 prepared.

EST 7:1  So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

EST 7:2  And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet
 of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee:
 and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the
 kingdom.

EST 7:3  Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy
 sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my
 petition, and my people at my request:

EST 7:4  For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to
 perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my
 tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.

EST 7:5  Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who
 is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?

EST 7:6  And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then
 Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.

EST 7:7  And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into
 the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther
 the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.

EST 7:8  Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the
 banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then
 said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the
 word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.

EST 7:9  And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold
 also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who
 spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said,
 Hang him thereon.

EST 7:10  So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
 Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.

EST 8:1  On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews'
 enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther
 had told what he was unto her.

EST 8:2  And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and
 gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.

EST 8:3  And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his
 feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the
 Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.

EST 8:4  Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther
 arose, and stood before the king,

EST 8:5  And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his
 sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his
 eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of
 Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all
 the king's provinces:

EST 8:6  For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people?
 or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?

EST 8:7  Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the
 Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged
 upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.

EST 8:8  Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and
 seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's
 name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.

EST 8:9  Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month,
 that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was
 written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the
 lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from
 India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every
 province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their
 language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their
 language.

EST 8:10  And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the
 king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules,
 camels, and young dromedaries:

EST 8:11  Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather
 themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to
 cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault
 them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,

EST 8:12  Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the
 thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.

EST 8:13  The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
 province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready
 against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.

EST 8:14  So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened
 and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan
 the palace.

EST 8:15  And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel
 of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine
 linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.

EST 8:16  The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.

EST 8:17  And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's
 commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a
 good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the
 Jews fell upon them.

EST 9:1  Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth
 day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be
 put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power
 over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over
 them that hated them;)

EST 9:2  The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all
 the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their
 hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all
 people.

EST 9:3  And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the
 deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of
 Mordecai fell upon them.

EST 9:4  For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out
 throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and
 greater.

EST 9:5  Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
 sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those
 that hated them.

EST 9:6  And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
 men.

EST 9:7  And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

EST 9:8  And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,

EST 9:9  And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,

EST 9:10  The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews,
 slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.

EST 9:11  On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace
 was brought before the king.

EST 9:12  And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and
 destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman;
 what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy
 petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and
 it shall be done.

EST 9:13  Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the
 Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's
 decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.

EST 9:14  And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at
 Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.

EST 9:15  For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the
 fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan;
 but on the prey they laid not their hand.

EST 9:16  But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered
 themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their
 enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not
 their hands on the prey,

EST 9:17  On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day
 of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.

EST 9:18  But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
 thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth
 day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.

EST 9:19  Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns,
 made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and
 a good day, and of sending portions one to another.

EST 9:20  And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews
 that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,

EST 9:21  To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day
 of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,

EST 9:22  As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month
 which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good
 day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending
 portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.

EST 9:23  And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had
 written unto them;

EST 9:24  Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all
 the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur,
 that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;

EST 9:25  But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that
 his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his
 own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.

EST 9:26  Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
 Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen
 concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,

EST 9:27  The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon
 all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they
 would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their
 appointed time every year;

EST 9:28  And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every
 generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days
 of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish
 from their seed.

EST 9:29  Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew,
 wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.

EST 9:30  And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and
 seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,

EST 9:31  To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as
 Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had
 decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and
 their cry.

EST 9:32  And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was
 written in the book.

EST 10:1  And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the
 isles of the sea.

EST 10:2  And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration
 of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?

EST 10:3  For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among
 the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth
 of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.

ISA 1:1  The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah
 and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of
 Judah.

ISA 1:2  Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I
 have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.

ISA 1:3  The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel
 doth not know, my people doth not consider.

ISA 1:4  Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers,
 children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked
 the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.

ISA 1:5  Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the
 whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

ISA 1:6  From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in
 it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed,
 neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.

ISA 1:7  Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land,
 strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by
 strangers.

ISA 1:8  And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a
 lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

ISA 1:9  Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we
 should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.

ISA 1:10  Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law
 of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

ISA 1:11  To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith
 the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed
 beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he
 goats.

ISA 1:12  When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your
 hand, to tread my courts?

ISA 1:13  Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the
 new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is
 iniquity, even the solemn meeting.

ISA 1:14  Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a
 trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.

ISA 1:15  And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you:
 yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of
 blood.

ISA 1:16  Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from
 before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

ISA 1:17  Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the
 fatherless, plead for the widow.

ISA 1:18  Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your
 sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
 crimson, they shall be as wool.

ISA 1:19  If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:

ISA 1:20  But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for
 the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

ISA 1:21  How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment;
 righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.

ISA 1:22  Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:

ISA 1:23  Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one
 loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless,
 neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.

ISA 1:24  Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of
 Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine
 enemies:

ISA 1:25  And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy
 dross, and take away all thy tin:

ISA 1:26  And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as
 at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of
 righteousness, the faithful city.

ISA 1:27  Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
 righteousness.

ISA 1:28  And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be
 together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.

ISA 1:29  For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye
 shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.

ISA 1:30  For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that
 hath no water.

ISA 1:31  And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and
 they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.

ISA 2:1  The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
 Jerusalem.

ISA 2:2  And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the
 LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be
 exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.

ISA 2:3  And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
 mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us
 of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth
 the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

ISA 2:4  And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people:
 and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into
 pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall
 they learn war any more.

ISA 2:5  O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.

ISA 2:6  Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because
 they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the
 Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.

ISA 2:7  Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end
 of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any
 end of their chariots:

ISA 2:8  Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own
 hands, that which their own fingers have made:

ISA 2:9  And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself:
 therefore forgive them not.

ISA 2:10  Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the
 LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.

ISA 2:11  The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men
 shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.

ISA 2:12  For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is
 proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be
 brought low:

ISA 2:13  And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and
 upon all the oaks of Bashan,

ISA 2:14  And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are
 lifted up,

ISA 2:15  And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,

ISA 2:16  And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

ISA 2:17  And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of
 men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.

ISA 2:18  And the idols he shall utterly abolish.

ISA 2:19  And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves
 of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he
 ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

ISA 2:20  In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of
 gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and
 to the bats;

ISA 2:21  To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged
 rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he
 ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

ISA 2:22  Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he
 to be accounted of ?

ISA 3:1  For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from
 Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and
 the whole stay of water.

ISA 3:2  The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and
 the prudent, and the ancient,

ISA 3:3  The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and
 the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.

ISA 3:4  And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule
 over them.

ISA 3:5  And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one
 by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the
 ancient, and the base against the honourable.

ISA 3:6  When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father,
 saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy
 hand:

ISA 3:7  In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my
 house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.

ISA 3:8  For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and
 their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.

ISA 3:9  The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they
 declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they
 have rewarded evil unto themselves.

ISA 3:10  Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they
 shall eat the fruit of their doings.

ISA 3:11  Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his
 hands shall be given him.

ISA 3:12  As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over
 them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the
 way of thy paths.

ISA 3:13  The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.

ISA 3:14  The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
 people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil
 of the poor is in your houses.

ISA 3:15  What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces
 of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

ISA 3:16  Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are
 haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and
 mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:

ISA 3:17  Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head
 of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.

ISA 3:18  In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling
 ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the
 moon,

ISA 3:19  The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

ISA 3:20  The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and
 the tablets, and the earrings,

ISA 3:21  The rings, and nose jewels,

ISA 3:22  The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples,
 and the crisping pins,

ISA 3:23  The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.

ISA 3:24  And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be
 stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness;
 and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of
 beauty.

ISA 3:25  Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

ISA 3:26  And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall
 sit upon the ground.

ISA 4:1  And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We
 will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by
 thy name, to take away our reproach.

ISA 4:2  In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious,
 and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are
 escaped of Israel.

ISA 4:3  And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that
 remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written
 among the living in Jerusalem:

ISA 4:4  When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of
 Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by
 the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.

ISA 4:5  And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and
 upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming
 fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.

ISA 4:6  And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the
 heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.

ISA 5:1  Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his
 vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:

ISA 5:2  And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it
 with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a
 winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it
 brought forth wild grapes.

ISA 5:3  And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray
 you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

ISA 5:4  What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in
 it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it
 forth wild grapes?

ISA 5:5  And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will
 take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the
 wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:

ISA 5:6  And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there
 shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they
 rain no rain upon it.

ISA 5:7  For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the
 men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold
 oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.

ISA 5:8  Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till
 there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!

ISA 5:9  In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be
 desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

ISA 5:10  Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an
 homer shall yield an ephah.

ISA 5:11  Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow
 strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!

ISA 5:12  And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are
 in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider
 the operation of his hands.

ISA 5:13  Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no
 knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried
 up with thirst.

ISA 5:14  Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without
 measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that
 rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

ISA 5:15  And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be
 humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:

ISA 5:16  But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is
 holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.

ISA 5:17  Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places
 of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

ISA 5:18  Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it
 were with a cart rope:

ISA 5:19  That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see
 it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we
 may know it!

ISA 5:20  Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness
 for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for
 bitter!

ISA 5:21  Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their
 own sight!

ISA 5:22  Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to
 mingle strong drink:

ISA 5:23  Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness
 of the righteous from him!

ISA 5:24  Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth
 the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go
 up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and
 despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

ISA 5:25  Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he
 hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the
 hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets.
 For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out
 still.

ISA 5:26  And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss
 unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed
 swiftly:

ISA 5:27  None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor
 sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet
 of their shoes be broken:

ISA 5:28  Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs
 shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:

ISA 5:29  Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions:
 yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away
 safe, and none shall deliver it.

ISA 5:30  And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the
 sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light
 is darkened in the heavens thereof.

ISA 6:1  In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a
 throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

ISA 6:2  Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he
 covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did
 fly.

ISA 6:3  And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of
 hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

ISA 6:4  And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and
 the house was filled with smoke.

ISA 6:5  Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean
 lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes
 have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

ISA 6:6  Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his
 hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:

ISA 6:7  And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy
 lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.

ISA 6:8  Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who
 will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.

ISA 6:9  And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand
 not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.

ISA 6:10  Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and
 shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
 understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.

ISA 6:11  Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be
 wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be
 utterly desolate,

ISA 6:12  And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great
 forsaking in the midst of the land.

ISA 6:13  But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be
 eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they
 cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.

ISA 7:1  And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of
 Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of
 Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but
 could not prevail against it.

ISA 7:2  And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with
 Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees
 of the wood are moved with the wind.

ISA 7:3  Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and
 Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the
 highway of the fuller's field;

ISA 7:4  And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be
 fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce
 anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.

ISA 7:5  Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil
 counsel against thee, saying,

ISA 7:6  Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach
 therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:

ISA 7:7  Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to
 pass.

ISA 7:8  For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin;
 and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not
 a people.

ISA 7:9  And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
 Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.

ISA 7:10  Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

ISA 7:11  Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or
 in the height above.

ISA 7:12  But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.

ISA 7:13  And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for
 you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

ISA 7:14  Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin
 shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

ISA 7:15  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the
 evil, and choose the good.

ISA 7:16  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the
 good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.

ISA 7:17  The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy
 father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed
 from Judah; even the king of Assyria.

ISA 7:18  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for
 the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee
 that is in the land of Assyria.

ISA 7:19  And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate
 valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all
 bushes.

ISA 7:20  In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,
 namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the
 hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.

ISA 7:21  And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a
 young cow, and two sheep;

ISA 7:22  And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall
 give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is
 left in the land.

ISA 7:23  And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be,
 where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be
 for briers and thorns.

ISA 7:24  With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the
 land shall become briers and thorns.

ISA 7:25  And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall
 not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the
 sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

ISA 8:1  Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in
 it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.

ISA 8:2  And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and
 Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

ISA 8:3  And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.
 Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.

ISA 8:4  For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my
 mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away
 before the king of Assyria.

ISA 8:5  The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,

ISA 8:6  Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go
 softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

ISA 8:7  Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters
 of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory:
 and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:

ISA 8:8  And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he
 shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill
 the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

ISA 8:9  Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces;
 and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be
 broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.

ISA 8:10  Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the
 word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

ISA 8:11  For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me
 that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,

ISA 8:12  Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say,
 A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.

ISA 8:13  Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let
 him be your dread.

ISA 8:14  And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for
 a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare
 to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

ISA 8:15  And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be
 snared, and be taken.

ISA 8:16  Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

ISA 8:17  And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of
 Jacob, and I will look for him.

ISA 8:18  Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs
 and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount
 Zion.

ISA 8:19  And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar
 spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people
 seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?

ISA 8:20  To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this
 word, it is because there is no light in them.

ISA 8:21  And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it
 shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret
 themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.

ISA 8:22  And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness,
 dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.

ISA 9:1  Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation,
 when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of
 Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the
 sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.

ISA 9:2  The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that
 dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.

ISA 9:3  Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy
 before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they
 divide the spoil.

ISA 9:4  For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his
 shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.

ISA 9:5  For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments
 rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.

ISA 9:6  For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
 government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
 Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of
 Peace.

ISA 9:7  Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end,
 upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish
 it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal
 of the LORD of hosts will perform this.

ISA 9:8  The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.

ISA 9:9  And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of
 Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

ISA 9:10  The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the
 sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.

ISA 9:11  Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against
 him, and join his enemies together;

ISA 9:12  The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour
 Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his
 hand is stretched out still.

ISA 9:13  For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do
 they seek the LORD of hosts.

ISA 9:14  Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and
 rush, in one day.

ISA 9:15  The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that
 teacheth lies, he is the tail.

ISA 9:16  For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are
 led of them are destroyed.

ISA 9:17  Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither
 shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an
 hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his
 anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

ISA 9:18  For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and
 thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount
 up like the lifting up of smoke.

ISA 9:19  Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the
 people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.

ISA 9:20  And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall
 eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every
 man the flesh of his own arm:

ISA 9:21  Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be
 against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is
 stretched out still.

ISA 10:1  Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
 grievousness which they have prescribed;

ISA 10:2  To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right
 from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may
 rob the fatherless!

ISA 10:3  And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation
 which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye
 leave your glory?

ISA 10:4  Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall
 fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand
 is stretched out still.

ISA 10:5  O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is
 mine indignation.

ISA 10:6  I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the
 people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take
 the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.

ISA 10:7  Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is
 in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.

ISA 10:8  For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?

ISA 10:9  Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as
 Damascus?

ISA 10:10  As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven
 images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

ISA 10:11  Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to
 Jerusalem and her idols?

ISA 10:12  Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed
 his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit
 of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

ISA 10:13  For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my
 wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and
 have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a
 valiant man:

ISA 10:14  And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as
 one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there
 was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.

ISA 10:15  Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or
 shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod
 should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should
 lift up itself, as if it were no wood.

ISA 10:16  Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones
 leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a
 fire.

ISA 10:17  And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a
 flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;

ISA 10:18  And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful
 field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer
 fainteth.

ISA 10:19  And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child
 may write them.

ISA 10:20  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
 Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again
 stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of
 Israel, in truth.

ISA 10:21  The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty
 God.

ISA 10:22  For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
 remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with
 righteousness.

ISA 10:23  For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined,
 in the midst of all the land.

ISA 10:24  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that
 dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a
 rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.

ISA 10:25  For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and
 mine anger in their destruction.

ISA 10:26  And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according
 to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the
 sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.

ISA 10:27  And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be
 taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the
 yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.

ISA 10:28  He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath
 laid up his carriages:

ISA 10:29  They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at
 Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

ISA 10:30  Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto
 Laish, O poor Anathoth.

ISA 10:31  Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to
 flee.

ISA 10:32  As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand
 against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

ISA 10:33  Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with
 terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty
 shall be humbled.

ISA 10:34  And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and
 Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

ISA 11:1  And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
 Branch shall grow out of his roots:

ISA 11:2  And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom
 and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge
 and of the fear of the LORD;

ISA 11:3  And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD:
 and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the
 hearing of his ears:

ISA 11:4  But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with
 equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod
 of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.

ISA 11:5  And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness
 the girdle of his reins.

ISA 11:6  The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie
 down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;
 and a little child shall lead them.

ISA 11:7  And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down
 together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

ISA 11:8  And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the
 weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.

ISA 11:9  They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the
 earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the
 sea.

ISA 11:10  And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand
 for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest
 shall be glorious.

ISA 11:11  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his
 hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall
 be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and
 from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

ISA 11:12  And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble
 the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the
 four corners of the earth.

ISA 11:13  The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah
 shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex
 Ephraim.

ISA 11:14  But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the
 west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand
 upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.

ISA 11:15  And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea;
 and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall
 smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod.

ISA 11:16  And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which
 shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came
 up out of the land of Egypt.

ISA 12:1  And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though
 thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.

ISA 12:2  Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the
 LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.

ISA 12:3  Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.

ISA 12:4  And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name,
 declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.

ISA 12:5  Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known
 in all the earth.

ISA 12:6  Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One
 of Israel in the midst of thee.

ISA 13:1  The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

ISA 13:2  Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto
 them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.

ISA 13:3  I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty
 ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.

ISA 13:4  The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people;
 a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of
 hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

ISA 13:5  They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the
 LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.

ISA 13:6  Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a
 destruction from the Almighty.

ISA 13:7  Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:

ISA 13:8  And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them;
 they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at
 another; their faces shall be as flames.

ISA 13:9  Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce
 anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out
 of it.

ISA 13:10  For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not
 give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon
 shall not cause her light to shine.

ISA 13:11  And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their
 iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay
 low the haughtiness of the terrible.

ISA 13:12  I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the
 golden wedge of Ophir.

ISA 13:13  Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out
 of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce
 anger.

ISA 13:14  And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh
 up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his
 own land.

ISA 13:15  Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that
 is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.

ISA 13:16  Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes;
 their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

ISA 13:17  Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not
 regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

ISA 13:18  Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall
 have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children.

ISA 13:19  And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees'
 excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

ISA 13:20  It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from
 generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither
 shall the shepherds make their fold there.

ISA 13:21  But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses
 shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs
 shall dance there.

ISA 13:22  And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate
 houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to
 come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

ISA 14:1  For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
 Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined
 with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.

ISA 14:2  And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and
 the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants
 and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were;
 and they shall rule over their oppressors.

ISA 14:3  And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee
 rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein
 thou wast made to serve,

ISA 14:4  That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and
 say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!

ISA 14:5  The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the
 rulers.

ISA 14:6  He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that
 ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.

ISA 14:7  The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into
 singing.

ISA 14:8  Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,
 saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.

ISA 14:9  Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it
 stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath
 raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.

ISA 14:10  All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as
 we? art thou become like unto us?

ISA 14:11  Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols:
 the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.

ISA 14:12  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how
 art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!

ISA 14:13  For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will
 exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the
 congregation, in the sides of the north:

ISA 14:14  I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the
 most High.

ISA 14:15  Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

ISA 14:16  They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee,
 saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake
 kingdoms;

ISA 14:17  That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
 thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

ISA 14:18  All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every
 one in his own house.

ISA 14:19  But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as
 the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go
 down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.

ISA 14:20  Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast
 destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never
 be renowned.

ISA 14:21  Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
 fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face
 of the world with cities.

ISA 14:22  For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut
 off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.

ISA 14:23  I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
 water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of
 hosts.

ISA 14:24  The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so
 shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:

ISA 14:25  That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains
 tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his
 burden depart from off their shoulders.

ISA 14:26  This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this
 is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

ISA 14:27  For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and
 his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

ISA 14:28  In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

ISA 14:29  Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote
 thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a
 cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.

ISA 14:30  And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie
 down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy
 remnant.

ISA 14:31  Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for
 there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his
 appointed times.

ISA 14:32  What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the
 LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.

ISA 15:1  The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
 waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid
 waste, and brought to silence;

ISA 15:2  He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab
 shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be
 baldness, and every beard cut off.

ISA 15:3  In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the
 tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping
 abundantly.

ISA 15:4  And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even
 unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life
 shall be grievous unto him.

ISA 15:5  My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar,
 an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping
 shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of
 destruction.

ISA 15:6  For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered
 away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.

ISA 15:7  Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have
 laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.

ISA 15:8  For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling
 thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beerelim.

ISA 15:9  For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more
 upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the
 land.

ISA 16:1  Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
 wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

ISA 16:2  For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so
 the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

ISA 16:3  Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the
 midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.

ISA 16:4  Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them
 from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler
 ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.

ISA 16:5  And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon
 it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and
 hasting righteousness.

ISA 16:6  We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his
 haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.

ISA 16:7  Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the
 foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.

ISA 16:8  For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords
 of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come
 even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are
 stretched out, they are gone over the sea.

ISA 16:9  Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah:
 I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for
 thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.

ISA 16:10  And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and
 in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting:
 the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their
 vintage shouting to cease.

ISA 16:11  Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine
 inward parts for Kirharesh.

ISA 16:12  And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the
 high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not
 prevail.

ISA 16:13  This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since
 that time.

ISA 16:14  But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the
 years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that
 great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble.

ISA 17:1  The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a
 city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.

ISA 17:2  The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which
 shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

ISA 17:3  The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from
 Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the
 children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.

ISA 17:4  And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall
 be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.

ISA 17:5  And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and
 reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears
 in the valley of Rephaim.

ISA 17:6  Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive
 tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five
 in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the LORD God of Israel.

ISA 17:7  At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have
 respect to the Holy One of Israel.

ISA 17:8  And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither
 shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the
 images.

ISA 17:9  In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an
 uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and
 there shall be desolation.

ISA 17:10  Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not
 been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant
 plants, and shalt set it with strange slips:

ISA 17:11  In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning
 shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the
 day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

ISA 17:12  Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the
 noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like
 the rushing of mighty waters!

ISA 17:13  The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God
 shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the
 chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the
 whirlwind.

ISA 17:14  And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is not.
 This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.

ISA 18:1  Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of
 Ethiopia:

ISA 18:2  That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes
 upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and
 peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted
 out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!

ISA 18:3  All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye,
 when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet,
 hear ye.

ISA 18:4  For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will
 consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud
 of dew in the heat of harvest.

ISA 18:5  For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is
 ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks,
 and take away and cut down the branches.

ISA 18:6  They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and
 to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the
 beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.

ISA 18:7  In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a
 people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning
 hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers
 have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.

ISA 19:1  The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and
 shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his
 presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.

ISA 19:2  And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall
 fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour;
 city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.

ISA 19:3  And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will
 destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the
 charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.

ISA 19:4  And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and
 a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.

ISA 19:5  And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted
 and dried up.

ISA 19:6  And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence
 shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.

ISA 19:7  The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every
 thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.

ISA 19:8  The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the
 brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall
 languish.

ISA 19:9  Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks,
 shall be confounded.

ISA 19:10  And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make
 sluices and ponds for fish.

ISA 19:11  Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise
 counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the
 son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

ISA 19:12  Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee
 now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.

ISA 19:13  The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are
 deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the
 tribes thereof.

ISA 19:14  The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and
 they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man
 staggereth in his vomit.

ISA 19:15  Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail,
 branch or rush, may do.

ISA 19:16  In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid
 and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he
 shaketh over it.

ISA 19:17  And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that
 maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel
 of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.

ISA 19:18  In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the
 language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The
 city of destruction.

ISA 19:19  In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the
 land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.

ISA 19:20  And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts
 in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the
 oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall
 deliver them.

ISA 19:21  And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know
 the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall
 vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.

ISA 19:22  And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and they
 shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall
 heal them.

ISA 19:23  In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and
 the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the
 Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

ISA 19:24  In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria,
 even a blessing in the midst of the land:

ISA 19:25  Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my
 people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.

ISA 20:1  In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of
 Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;

ISA 20:2  At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go
 and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy
 foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

ISA 20:3  And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and
 barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;

ISA 20:4  So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and
 the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their
 buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.

ISA 20:5  And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their
 expectation, and of Egypt their glory.

ISA 20:6  And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such
 is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of
 Assyria: and how shall we escape?

ISA 21:1  The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass
 through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.

ISA 21:2  A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth
 treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all
 the sighing thereof have I made to cease.

ISA 21:3  Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon
 me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing
 of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.

ISA 21:4  My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure
 hath he turned into fear unto me.

ISA 21:5  Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye
 princes, and anoint the shield.

ISA 21:6  For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him
 declare what he seeth.

ISA 21:7  And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses,
 and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:

ISA 21:8  And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the
 watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:

ISA 21:9  And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen.
 And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven
 images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.

ISA 21:10  O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard
 of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.

ISA 21:11  The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what
 of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

ISA 21:12  The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye
 will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.

ISA 21:13  The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye
 travelling companies of Dedanim.

ISA 21:14  The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was
 thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.

ISA 21:15  For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the
 bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

ISA 21:16  For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according to the
 years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:

ISA 21:17  And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the
 children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath
 spoken it.

ISA 22:1  The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou
 art wholly gone up to the housetops?

ISA 22:2  Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city: thy
 slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.

ISA 22:3  All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all
 that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far.

ISA 22:4  Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not
 to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.

ISA 22:5  For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity
 by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls,
 and of crying to the mountains.

ISA 22:6  And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir
 uncovered the shield.

ISA 22:7  And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full of
 chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.

ISA 22:8  And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in that
 day to the armour of the house of the forest.

ISA 22:9  Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are
 many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.

ISA 22:10  And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye
 broken down to fortify the wall.

ISA 22:11  Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old
 pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto
 him that fashioned it long ago.

ISA 22:12  And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to
 mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:

ISA 22:13  And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating
 flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.

ISA 22:14  And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this
 iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of
 hosts.

ISA 22:15  Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer,
 even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,

ISA 22:16  What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed
 thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high, and
 that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock?

ISA 22:17  Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and
 will surely cover thee.

ISA 22:18  He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large
 country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory shall be
 the shame of thy lord's house.

ISA 22:19  And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he
 pull thee down.

ISA 22:20  And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant
 Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:

ISA 22:21  And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy
 girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a
 father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.

ISA 22:22  And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so
 he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.

ISA 22:23  And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for
 a glorious throne to his father's house.

ISA 22:24  And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's
 house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the
 vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.

ISA 22:25  In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is
 fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the
 burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken it.

ISA 23:1  The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste,
 so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is
 revealed to them.

ISA 23:2  Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of
 Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.

ISA 23:3  And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is
 her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.

ISA 23:4  Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the strength
 of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I
 nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.

ISA 23:5  As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at
 the report of Tyre.

ISA 23:6  Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.

ISA 23:7  Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own
 feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.

ISA 23:8  Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose
 merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?

ISA 23:9  The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all
 glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.

ISA 23:10  Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is
 no more strength.

ISA 23:11  He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the
 LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city, to destroy the
 strong holds thereof.

ISA 23:12  And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin,
 daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no
 rest.

ISA 23:13  Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the
 Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the
 towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to
 ruin.

ISA 23:14  Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.

ISA 23:15  And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten
 seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy
 years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.

ISA 23:16  Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been
 forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be
 remembered.

ISA 23:17  And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the
 LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit
 fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.

ISA 23:18  And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it
 shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them
 that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

ISA 24:1  Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and
 turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.

ISA 24:2  And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the
 servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with
 the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as
 with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.

ISA 24:3  The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD
 hath spoken this word.

ISA 24:4  The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth
 away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.

ISA 24:5  The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they
 have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting
 covenant.

ISA 24:6  Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell
 therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and
 few men left.

ISA 24:7  The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do
 sigh.

ISA 24:8  The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
 endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.

ISA 24:9  They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter
 to them that drink it.

ISA 24:10  The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that
 no man may come in.

ISA 24:11  There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the
 mirth of the land is gone.

ISA 24:12  In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
 destruction.

ISA 24:13  When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the
 people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning
 grapes when the vintage is done.

ISA 24:14  They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty
 of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

ISA 24:15  Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the
 LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.

ISA 24:16  From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory
 to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the
 treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers
 have dealt very treacherously.

ISA 24:17  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the
 earth.

ISA 24:18  And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the
 fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the
 pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and
 the foundations of the earth do shake.

ISA 24:19  The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the
 earth is moved exceedingly.

ISA 24:20  The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be
 removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it;
 and it shall fall, and not rise again.

ISA 24:21  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish
 the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon
 the earth.

ISA 24:22  And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
 in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall
 they be visited.

ISA 24:23  Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the
 LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his
 ancients gloriously.

ISA 25:1  O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name;
 for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and
 truth.

ISA 25:2  For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a
 palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.

ISA 25:3  Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the
 terrible nations shall fear thee.

ISA 25:4  For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in
 his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast
 of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.

ISA 25:5  Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry
 place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible
 ones shall be brought low.

ISA 25:6  And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a
 feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of
 marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

ISA 25:7  And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast
 over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.

ISA 25:8  He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away
 tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away
 from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.

ISA 25:9  And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited
 for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we
 will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

ISA 25:10  For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall
 be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.

ISA 25:11  And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that
 swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their
 pride together with the spoils of their hands.

ISA 25:12  And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down,
 lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

ISA 26:1  In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a
 strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.

ISA 26:2  Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth
 may enter in.

ISA 26:3  Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee:
 because he trusteth in thee.

ISA 26:4  Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting
 strength:

ISA 26:5  For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he
 layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even
 to the dust.

ISA 26:6  The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the
 steps of the needy.

ISA 26:7  The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh
 the path of the just.

ISA 26:8  Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee;
 the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.

ISA 26:9  With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit
 within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the
 earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.

ISA 26:10  Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
 righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not
 behold the majesty of the LORD.

ISA 26:11  LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall
 see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine
 enemies shall devour them.

ISA 26:12  LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all
 our works in us.

ISA 26:13  O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us:
 but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

ISA 26:14  They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall
 not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their
 memory to perish.

ISA 26:15  Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the
 nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends
 of the earth.

ISA 26:16  LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer
 when thy chastening was upon them.

ISA 26:17  Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her
 delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy
 sight, O LORD.

ISA 26:18  We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were
 brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither
 have the inhabitants of the world fallen.

ISA 26:19  Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
 arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of
 herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

ISA 26:20  Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors
 about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the
 indignation be overpast.

ISA 26:21  For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the
 inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose
 her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

ISA 27:1  In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall
 punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent;
 and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.

ISA 27:2  In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.

ISA 27:3  I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt
 it, I will keep it night and day.

ISA 27:4  Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in
 battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.

ISA 27:5  Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me;
 and he shall make peace with me.

ISA 27:6  He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall
 blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.

ISA 27:7  Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain
 according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?

ISA 27:8  In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he
 stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.

ISA 27:9  By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is
 all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the
 altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall
 not stand up.

ISA 27:10  Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation
 forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there
 shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.

ISA 27:11  When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the
 women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding:
 therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed
 them will shew them no favour.

ISA 27:12  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off
 from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be
 gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.

ISA 27:13  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall
 be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of
 Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD
 in the holy mount at Jerusalem.

ISA 28:1  Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
 glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys
 of them that are overcome with wine!

ISA 28:2  Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of
 hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall
 cast down to the earth with the hand.

ISA 28:3  The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under
 feet:

ISA 28:4  And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley,
 shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which
 when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it
 up.

ISA 28:5  In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for
 a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,

ISA 28:6  And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for
 strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.

ISA 28:7  But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are
 out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong
 drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong
 drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.

ISA 28:8  For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no
 place clean.

ISA 28:9  Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand
 doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.

ISA 28:10  For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon
 line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:

ISA 28:11  For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this
 people.

ISA 28:12  To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary
 to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.

ISA 28:13  But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept
 upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a
 little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and
 taken.

ISA 28:14  Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this
 people which is in Jerusalem.

ISA 28:15  Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with
 hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it
 shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood
 have we hid ourselves:

ISA 28:16  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
 foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure
 foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.

ISA 28:17  Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
 plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters
 shall overflow the hiding place.

ISA 28:18  And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
 agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass
 through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.

ISA 28:19  From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by
 morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation
 only to understand the report.

ISA 28:20  For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it:
 and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.

ISA 28:21  For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as
 in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring
 to pass his act, his strange act.

ISA 28:22  Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for
 I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon
 the whole earth.

ISA 28:23  Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.

ISA 28:24  Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the
 clods of his ground?

ISA 28:25  When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad
 the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the
 appointed barley and the rie in their place?

ISA 28:26  For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.

ISA 28:27  For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
 neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are
 beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.

ISA 28:28  Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor
 break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.

ISA 28:29  This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in
 counsel, and excellent in working.

ISA 29:1  Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to
 year; let them kill sacrifices.

ISA 29:2  Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow:
 and it shall be unto me as Ariel.

ISA 29:3  And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against
 thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.

ISA 29:4  And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the
 ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be,
 as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech
 shall whisper out of the dust.

ISA 29:5  Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and
 the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away: yea,
 it shall be at an instant suddenly.

ISA 29:6  Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with
 earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of
 devouring fire.

ISA 29:7  And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even
 all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be
 as a dream of a night vision.

ISA 29:8  It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he
 eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man
 dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is
 faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations
 be, that fight against mount Zion.

ISA 29:9  Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken,
 but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.

ISA 29:10  For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and
 hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he
 covered.

ISA 29:11  And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that
 is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I
 pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:

ISA 29:12  And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read
 this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.

ISA 29:13  Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with
 their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart
 far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:

ISA 29:14  Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this
 people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men
 shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.

ISA 29:15  Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
 LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who
 knoweth us?

ISA 29:16  Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the
 potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or
 shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?

ISA 29:17  Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into
 a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?

ISA 29:18  And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the
 eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.

ISA 29:19  The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor
 among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

ISA 29:20  For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is
 consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:

ISA 29:21  That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that
 reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.

ISA 29:22  Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the
 house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now
 wax pale.

ISA 29:23  But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst
 of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and
 shall fear the God of Israel.

ISA 29:24  They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they
 that murmured shall learn doctrine.

ISA 30:1  Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel,
 but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that
 they may add sin to sin:

ISA 30:2  That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to
 strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow
 of Egypt!

ISA 30:3  Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust
 in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

ISA 30:4  For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.

ISA 30:5  They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be
 an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

ISA 30:6  The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and
 anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying
 serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and
 their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit
 them.

ISA 30:7  For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore
 have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.

ISA 30:8  Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that
 it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

ISA 30:9  That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will
 not hear the law of the LORD:

ISA 30:10  Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not
 unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:

ISA 30:11  Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy
 One of Israel to cease from before us.

ISA 30:12  Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this
 word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:

ISA 30:13  Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall,
 swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.

ISA 30:14  And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is
 broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the
 bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal
 out of the pit.

ISA 30:15  For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning
 and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your
 strength: and ye would not.

ISA 30:16  But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye
 flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you
 be swift.

ISA 30:17  One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five
 shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as
 an ensign on an hill.

ISA 30:18  And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
 you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for
 the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.

ISA 30:19  For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no
 more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he
 shall hear it, he will answer thee.

ISA 30:20  And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water
 of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more,
 but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:

ISA 30:21  And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the
 way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the
 left.

ISA 30:22  Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
 silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them
 away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.

ISA 30:23  Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the
 ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat
 and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.

ISA 30:24  The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat
 clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.

ISA 30:25  And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high
 hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when
 the towers fall.

ISA 30:26  Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and
 the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the
 day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke
 of their wound.

ISA 30:27  Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
 anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and
 his tongue as a devouring fire:

ISA 30:28  And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst
 of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be
 a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.

ISA 30:29  Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept;
 and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the
 mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.

ISA 30:30  And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall
 shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and
 with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and
 hailstones.

ISA 30:31  For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down,
 which smote with a rod.

ISA 30:32  And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the
 LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles
 of shaking will he fight with it.

ISA 30:33  For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he
 hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the
 breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.

ISA 31:1  Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and
 trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are
 very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the
 LORD!

ISA 31:2  Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his
 words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the
 help of them that work iniquity.

ISA 31:3  Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and
 not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth
 shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail
 together.

ISA 31:4  For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young
 lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth
 against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the
 noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount
 Zion, and for the hill thereof.

ISA 31:5  As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;
 defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.

ISA 31:6  Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply
 revolted.

ISA 31:7  For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and
 his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.

ISA 31:8  Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and
 the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the
 sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.

ISA 31:9  And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes
 shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his
 furnace in Jerusalem.

ISA 32:1  Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule
 in judgment.

ISA 32:2  And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert
 from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great
 rock in a weary land.

ISA 32:3  And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them
 that hear shall hearken.

ISA 32:4  The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue
 of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

ISA 32:5  The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said
 to be bountiful.

ISA 32:6  For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work
 iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make
 empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to
 fail.

ISA 32:7  The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
 devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh
 right.

ISA 32:8  But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall
 he stand.

ISA 32:9  Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless
 daughters; give ear unto my speech.

ISA 32:10  Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the
 vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

ISA 32:11  Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones:
 strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.

ISA 32:12  They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the
 fruitful vine.

ISA 32:13  Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea,
 upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:

ISA 32:14  Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city
 shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild
 asses, a pasture of flocks;

ISA 32:15  Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness
 be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.

ISA 32:16  Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
 remain in the fruitful field.

ISA 32:17  And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of
 righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.

ISA 32:18  And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure
 dwellings, and in quiet resting places;

ISA 32:19  When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be
 low in a low place.

ISA 32:20  Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither
 the feet of the ox and the ass.

ISA 33:1  Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest
 treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt
 cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to
 deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.

ISA 33:2  O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their
 arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.

ISA 33:3  At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of
 thyself the nations were scattered.

ISA 33:4  And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the
 caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.

ISA 33:5  The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion
 with judgment and righteousness.

ISA 33:6  And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and
 strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.

ISA 33:7  Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of
 peace shall weep bitterly.

ISA 33:8  The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the
 covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.

ISA 33:9  The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down:
 Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.

ISA 33:10  Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I
 lift up myself.

ISA 33:11  Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath,
 as fire, shall devour you.

ISA 33:12  And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up
 shall they be burned in the fire.

ISA 33:13  Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near,
 acknowledge my might.

ISA 33:14  The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
 hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us
 shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

ISA 33:15  He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that
 despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of
 bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes
 from seeing evil;

ISA 33:16  He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions
 of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.

ISA 33:17  Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the
 land that is very far off.

ISA 33:18  Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the
 receiver? where is he that counted the towers?

ISA 33:19  Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than
 thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.

ISA 33:20  Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see
 Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not
 one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the
 cords thereof be broken.

ISA 33:21  But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers
 and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship
 pass thereby.

ISA 33:22  For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our
 king; he will save us.

ISA 33:23  Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their
 mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil
 divided; the lame take the prey.

ISA 33:24  And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell
 therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.

ISA 34:1  Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth
 hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of
 it.

ISA 34:2  For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury
 upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them
 to the slaughter.

ISA 34:3  Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out
 of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.

ISA 34:4  And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall
 be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the
 leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.

ISA 34:5  For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down
 upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.

ISA 34:6  The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with
 fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys
 of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter
 in the land of Idumea.

ISA 34:7  And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the
 bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat
 with fatness.

ISA 34:8  For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of
 recompences for the controversy of Zion.

ISA 34:9  And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust
 thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.

ISA 34:10  It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go
 up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall
 pass through it for ever and ever.

ISA 34:11  But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and
 the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of
 confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

ISA 34:12  They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be
 there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

ISA 34:13  And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the
 fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for
 owls.

ISA 34:14  The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts
 of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also
 shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.

ISA 34:15  There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and
 gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one
 with her mate.

ISA 34:16  Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall
 fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his
 spirit it hath gathered them.

ISA 34:17  And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto
 them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation
 shall they dwell therein.

ISA 35:1  The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the
 desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

ISA 35:2  It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing:
 the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and
 Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.

ISA 35:3  Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

ISA 35:4  Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold,
 your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come
 and save you.

ISA 35:5  Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf
 shall be unstopped.

ISA 35:6  Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb
 sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the
 desert.

ISA 35:7  And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land
 springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be
 grass with reeds and rushes.

ISA 35:8  And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The
 way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for
 those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.

ISA 35:9  No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon,
 it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:

ISA 35:10  And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with
 songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and
 gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

ISA 36:1  Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that
 Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of
 Judah, and took them.

ISA 36:2  And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto
 king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper
 pool in the highway of the fuller's field.

ISA 36:3  Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the
 house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.

ISA 36:4  And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the
 great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou
 trustest?

ISA 36:5  I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and
 strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against
 me?

ISA 36:6  Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon
 if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of
 Egypt to all that trust in him.

ISA 36:7  But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he,
 whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to
 Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?

ISA 36:8  Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of
 Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy
 part to set riders upon them.

ISA 36:9  How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of
 my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for
 horsemen?

ISA 36:10  And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy
 it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.

ISA 36:11  Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray
 thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and
 speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on
 the wall.

ISA 36:12  But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee
 to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall,
 that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?

ISA 36:13  Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
 language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.

ISA 36:14  Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not
 be able to deliver you.

ISA 36:15  Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD
 will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the
 king of Assyria.

ISA 36:16  Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an
 agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of
 his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of
 his own cistern;

ISA 36:17  Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land
 of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

ISA 36:18  Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver us.
 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the
 king of Assyria?

ISA 36:19  Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of
 Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

ISA 36:20  Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered
 their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my
 hand?

ISA 36:21  But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the
 king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

ISA 36:22  Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the
 household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder,
 to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

ISA 37:1  And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his
 clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the
 LORD.

ISA 37:2  And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the
 scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the
 prophet the son of Amoz.

ISA 37:3  And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of
 trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the
 birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

ISA 37:4  It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the
 king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will
 reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy
 prayer for the remnant that is left.

ISA 37:5  So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

ISA 37:6  And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus
 saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith
 the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

ISA 37:7  Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and
 return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own
 land.

ISA 37:8  So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against
 Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.

ISA 37:9  And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come
 forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to
 Hezekiah, saying,

ISA 37:10  Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy
 God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be
 given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

ISA 37:11  Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all
 lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?

ISA 37:12  Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have
 destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which
 were in Telassar?

ISA 37:13  Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king
 of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

ISA 37:14  And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers,
 and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it
 before the LORD.

ISA 37:15  And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,

ISA 37:16  O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims,
 thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou
 hast made heaven and earth.

ISA 37:17  Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and
 see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the
 living God.

ISA 37:18  Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
 nations, and their countries,

ISA 37:19  And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but
 the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.

ISA 37:20  Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the
 kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only.

ISA 37:21  Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith
 the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib
 king of Assyria:

ISA 37:22  This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
 virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn;
 the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

ISA 37:23  Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou
 exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy
 One of Israel.

ISA 37:24  By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the
 multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the
 sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice
 fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the
 forest of his Carmel.

ISA 37:25  I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I
 dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

ISA 37:26  Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient
 times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou
 shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.

ISA 37:27  Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed
 and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb,
 as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.

ISA 37:28  But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy
 rage against me.

ISA 37:29  Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine
 ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips,
 and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.

ISA 37:30  And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as
 groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and
 in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit
 thereof.

ISA 37:31  And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again
 take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

ISA 37:32  For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape
 out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.

ISA 37:33  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He
 shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it
 with shields, nor cast a bank against it.

ISA 37:34  By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not
 come into this city, saith the LORD.

ISA 37:35  For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my
 servant David's sake.

ISA 37:36  Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the
 Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose
 early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

ISA 37:37  So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and
 dwelt at Nineveh.

ISA 37:38  And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch
 his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and
 they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his
 stead.

ISA 38:1  In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet
 the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set
 thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.

ISA 38:2  Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the
 LORD,

ISA 38:3  And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked
 before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is
 good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

ISA 38:4  Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,

ISA 38:5  Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy
 father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add
 unto thy days fifteen years.

ISA 38:6  And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of
 Assyria: and I will defend this city.

ISA 38:7  And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will
 do this thing that he hath spoken;

ISA 38:8  Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone
 down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten
 degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.

ISA 38:9  The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was
 recovered of his sickness:

ISA 38:10  I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the
 grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.

ISA 38:11  I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the
 living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.

ISA 38:12  Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I
 have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness:
 from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

ISA 38:13  I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my
 bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

ISA 38:14  Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove:
 mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.

ISA 38:15  What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done
 it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.

ISA 38:16  O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the
 life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.

ISA 38:17  Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to
 my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my
 sins behind thy back.

ISA 38:18  For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they
 that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.

ISA 38:19  The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the
 father to the children shall make known thy truth.

ISA 38:20  The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs
 to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the
 LORD.

ISA 38:21  For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a
 plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.

ISA 38:22  Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the
 house of the LORD?

ISA 39:1  At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon,
 sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been
 sick, and was recovered.

ISA 39:2  And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his
 precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious
 ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his
 treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that
 Hezekiah shewed them not.

ISA 39:3  Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him,
 What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said,
 They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.

ISA 39:4  Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
 answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my
 treasures that I have not shewed them.

ISA 39:5  Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:

ISA 39:6  Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that
 which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to
 Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.

ISA 39:7  And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget,
 shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of
 Babylon.

ISA 39:8  Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou
 hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.

ISA 40:1  Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

ISA 40:2  Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare
 is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the
 LORD's hand double for all her sins.

ISA 40:3  The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
 of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

ISA 40:4  Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be
 made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:

ISA 40:5  And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see
 it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

ISA 40:6  The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is
 grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:

ISA 40:7  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the
 LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.

ISA 40:8  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall
 stand for ever.

ISA 40:9  O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
 mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with
 strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold
 your God!

ISA 40:10  Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall
 rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.

ISA 40:11  He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs
 with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that
 are with young.

ISA 40:12  Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted
 out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a
 measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?

ISA 40:13  Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor
 hath taught him?

ISA 40:14  With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him
 in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way
 of understanding?

ISA 40:15  Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as
 the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very
 little thing.

ISA 40:16  And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
 sufficient for a burnt offering.

ISA 40:17  All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him
 less than nothing, and vanity.

ISA 40:18  To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare
 unto him?

ISA 40:19  The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it
 over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

ISA 40:20  He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree
 that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven
 image, that shall not be moved.

ISA 40:21  Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from
 the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?

ISA 40:22  It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
 inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a
 curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:

ISA 40:23  That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the
 earth as vanity.

ISA 40:24  Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
 yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow
 upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as
 stubble.

ISA 40:25  To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy
 One.

ISA 40:26  Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things,
 that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the
 greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.

ISA 40:27  Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from
 the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?

ISA 40:28  Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting
 God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is
 weary? there is no searching of his understanding.

ISA 40:29  He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he
 increaseth strength.

ISA 40:30  Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall
 utterly fall:

ISA 40:31  But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they
 shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and
 they shall walk, and not faint.

ISA 41:1  Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their
 strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together
 to judgment.

ISA 41:2  Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his
 foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them
 as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.

ISA 41:3  He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not
 gone with his feet.

ISA 41:4  Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the
 beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.

ISA 41:5  The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew
 near, and came.

ISA 41:6  They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his
 brother, Be of good courage.

ISA 41:7  So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with
 the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering:
 and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.

ISA 41:8  But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed
 of Abraham my friend.

ISA 41:9  Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee
 from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have
 chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

ISA 41:10  Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy
 God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee
 with the right hand of my righteousness.

ISA 41:11  Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed
 and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee
 shall perish.

ISA 41:12  Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that
 contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a
 thing of nought.

ISA 41:13  For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee,
 Fear not; I will help thee.

ISA 41:14  Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee,
 saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.

ISA 41:15  Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having
 teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make
 the hills as chaff.

ISA 41:16  Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the
 whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, and shalt
 glory in the Holy One of Israel.

ISA 41:17  When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their
 tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel
 will not forsake them.

ISA 41:18  I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the
 valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs
 of water.

ISA 41:19  I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the
 myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the
 pine, and the box tree together:

ISA 41:20  That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together,
 that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath
 created it.

ISA 41:21  Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons,
 saith the King of Jacob.

ISA 41:22  Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them
 shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the
 latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.

ISA 41:23  Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye
 are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it
 together.

ISA 41:24  Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination
 is he that chooseth you.

ISA 41:25  I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the
 rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes
 as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.

ISA 41:26  Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and
 beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that
 sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that heareth
 your words.

ISA 41:27  The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to
 Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.

ISA 41:28  For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was
 no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.

ISA 41:29  Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten
 images are wind and confusion.

ISA 42:1  Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
 delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment
 to the Gentiles.

ISA 42:2  He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the
 street.

ISA 42:3  A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not
 quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

ISA 42:4  He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment
 in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

ISA 42:5  Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched
 them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he
 that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk
 therein:

ISA 42:6  I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine
 hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a
 light of the Gentiles;

ISA 42:7  To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
 prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

ISA 42:8  I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to
 another, neither my praise to graven images.

ISA 42:9  Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I
 declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

ISA 42:10  Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the
 earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and
 the inhabitants thereof.

ISA 42:11  Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the
 villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let
 them shout from the top of the mountains.

ISA 42:12  Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the
 islands.

ISA 42:13  The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy
 like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his
 enemies.

ISA 42:14  I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained
 myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at
 once.

ISA 42:15  I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs;
 and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.

ISA 42:16  And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead
 them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before
 them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not
 forsake them.

ISA 42:17  They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust
 in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.

ISA 42:18  Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

ISA 42:19  Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent?
 who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?

ISA 42:20  Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he
 heareth not.

ISA 42:21  The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will
 magnify the law, and make it honourable.

ISA 42:22  But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared
 in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none
 delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.

ISA 42:23  Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for
 the time to come?

ISA 42:24  Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the
 LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways,
 neither were they obedient unto his law.

ISA 42:25  Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the
 strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not;
 and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.

ISA 43:1  But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that
 formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee
 by thy name; thou art mine.

ISA 43:2  When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
 through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through
 the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.

ISA 43:3  For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I
 gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.

ISA 43:4  Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and
 I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy
 life.

ISA 43:5  Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the
 east, and gather thee from the west;

ISA 43:6  I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back:
 bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;

ISA 43:7  Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for
 my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

ISA 43:8  Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have
 ears.

ISA 43:9  Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be
 assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let
 them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them
 hear, and say, It is truth.

ISA 43:10  Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have
 chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before
 me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.

ISA 43:11  I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.

ISA 43:12  I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was
 no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that
 I am God.

ISA 43:13  Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver
 out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

ISA 43:14  Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your
 sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the
 Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.

ISA 43:15  I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.

ISA 43:16  Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path
 in the mighty waters;

ISA 43:17  Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power;
 they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are
 quenched as tow.

ISA 43:18  Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of
 old.

ISA 43:19  Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye
 not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the
 desert.

ISA 43:20  The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls:
 because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give
 drink to my people, my chosen.

ISA 43:21  This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
 praise.

ISA 43:22  But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary
 of me, O Israel.

ISA 43:23  Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings;
 neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to
 serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.

ISA 43:24  Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou
 filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with
 thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.

ISA 43:25  I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own
 sake, and will not remember thy sins.

ISA 43:26  Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that
 thou mayest be justified.

ISA 43:27  Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed
 against me.

ISA 43:28  Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have
 given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

ISA 44:1  Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:

ISA 44:2  Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb,
 which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom
 I have chosen.

ISA 44:3  For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the
 dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine
 offspring:

ISA 44:4  And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water
 courses.

ISA 44:5  One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the
 name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and
 surname himself by the name of Israel.

ISA 44:6  Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of
 hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

ISA 44:7  And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order
 for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are
 coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.

ISA 44:8  Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that
 time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside
 me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.

ISA 44:9  They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their
 delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they
 see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.

ISA 44:10  Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable
 for nothing?

ISA 44:11  Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are
 of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall
 fear, and they shall be ashamed together.

ISA 44:12  The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth
 it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is
 hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.

ISA 44:13  The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a
 line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and
 maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that
 it may remain in the house.

ISA 44:14  He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which
 he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an
 ash, and the rain doth nourish it.

ISA 44:15  Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and
 warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a
 god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down
 thereto.

ISA 44:16  He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth
 flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and
 saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:

ISA 44:17  And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he
 falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith,
 Deliver me; for thou art my god.

ISA 44:18  They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes,
 that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.

ISA 44:19  And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor
 understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have
 baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and
 shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the
 stock of a tree?

ISA 44:20  He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he
 cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?

ISA 44:21  Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have
 formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of
 me.

ISA 44:22  I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a
 cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.

ISA 44:23  Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts
 of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every
 tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in
 Israel.

ISA 44:24  Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the
 womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens
 alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;

ISA 44:25  That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad;
 that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;

ISA 44:26  That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel
 of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and
 to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed
 places thereof:

ISA 44:27  That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:

ISA 44:28  That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my
 pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple,
 Thy foundation shall be laid.

ISA 45:1  Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I
 have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of
 kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be
 shut;

ISA 45:2  I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will
 break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:

ISA 45:3  And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of
 secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy
 name, am the God of Israel.

ISA 45:4  For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even
 called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.

ISA 45:5  I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I
 girded thee, though thou hast not known me:

ISA 45:6  That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west,
 that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.

ISA 45:7  I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil:
 I the LORD do all these things.

ISA 45:8  Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
 righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and
 let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.

ISA 45:9  Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive
 with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth
 it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?

ISA 45:10  Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or
 to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?

ISA 45:11  Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me
 of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands
 command ye me.

ISA 45:12  I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands,
 have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.

ISA 45:13  I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his
 ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price
 nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.

ISA 45:14  Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of
 Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and
 they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come
 over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto
 thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.

ISA 45:15  Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the
 Saviour.

ISA 45:16  They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall
 go to confusion together that are makers of idols.

ISA 45:17  But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation:
 ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.

ISA 45:18  For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that
 formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in
 vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.

ISA 45:19  I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said
 not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak
 righteousness, I declare things that are right.

ISA 45:20  Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are
 escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their
 graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.

ISA 45:21  Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together:
 who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time?
 have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a
 Saviour; there is none beside me.

ISA 45:22  Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am
 God, and there is none else.

ISA 45:23  I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
 righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every
 tongue shall swear.

ISA 45:24  Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and
 strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him
 shall be ashamed.

ISA 45:25  In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall
 glory.

ISA 46:1  Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and
 upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a burden to the
 weary beast.

ISA 46:2  They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
 burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.

ISA 46:3  Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house
 of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the
 womb:

ISA 46:4  And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry
 you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.

ISA 46:5  To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we
 may be like?

ISA 46:6  They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and
 hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.

ISA 46:7  They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his
 place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall
 cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.

ISA 46:8  Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye
 transgressors.

ISA 46:9  Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none
 else; I am God, and there is none like me,

ISA 46:10  Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the
 things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do
 all my pleasure:

ISA 46:11  Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my
 counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to
 pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.

ISA 46:12  Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness:

ISA 46:13  I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my
 salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my
 glory.

ISA 47:1  Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on
 the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt
 no more be called tender and delicate.

ISA 47:2  Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the
 leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

ISA 47:3  Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I
 will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.

ISA 47:4  As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of
 Israel.

ISA 47:5  Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the
 Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.

ISA 47:6  I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and
 given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient
 hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

ISA 47:7  And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not
 lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.

ISA 47:8  Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that
 dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside
 me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:

ISA 47:9  But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the
 loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their
 perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of
 thine enchantments.

ISA 47:10  For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth
 me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said
 in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.

ISA 47:11  Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence
 it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put
 it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not
 know.

ISA 47:12  Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy
 sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be
 able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.

ISA 47:13  Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
 astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save
 thee from these things that shall come upon thee.

ISA 47:14  Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they
 shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be
 a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.

ISA 47:15  Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy
 merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none
 shall save thee.

ISA 48:1  Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of
 Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the
 name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth,
 nor in righteousness.

ISA 48:2  For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon
 the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.

ISA 48:3  I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went
 forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came
 to pass.

ISA 48:4  Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron
 sinew, and thy brow brass;

ISA 48:5  I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to
 pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and
 my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.

ISA 48:6  Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have
 shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not
 know them.

ISA 48:7  They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day
 when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.

ISA 48:8  Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time
 that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very
 treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.

ISA 48:9  For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I
 refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.

ISA 48:10  Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee
 in the furnace of affliction.

ISA 48:11  For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how
 should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.

ISA 48:12  Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the
 first, I also am the last.

ISA 48:13  Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right
 hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.

ISA 48:14  All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath
 declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on
 Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.

ISA 48:15  I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought
 him, and he shall make his way prosperous.

ISA 48:16  Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from
 the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord
 GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

ISA 48:17  Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the
 LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way
 that thou shouldest go.

ISA 48:18  O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace
 been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:

ISA 48:19  Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels
 like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed
 from before me.

ISA 48:20  Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of
 singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye,
 The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.

ISA 48:21  And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he
 caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock
 also, and the waters gushed out.

ISA 48:22  There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.

ISA 49:1  Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD
 hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made
 mention of my name.

ISA 49:2  And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his
 hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid
 me;

ISA 49:3  And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be
 glorified.

ISA 49:4  Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for
 nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work
 with my God.

ISA 49:5  And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his
 servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet
 shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.

ISA 49:6  And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to
 raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will
 also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation
 unto the end of the earth.

ISA 49:7  Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him
 whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers,
 Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD
 that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.

ISA 49:8  Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in
 a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give
 thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to
 inherit the desolate heritages;

ISA 49:9  That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in
 darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures
 shall be in all high places.

ISA 49:10  They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun
 smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the
 springs of water shall he guide them.

ISA 49:11  And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be
 exalted.

ISA 49:12  Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and
 from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

ISA 49:13  Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
 singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have
 mercy upon his afflicted.

ISA 49:14  But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten
 me.

ISA 49:15  Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
 compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not
 forget thee.

ISA 49:16  Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are
 continually before me.

ISA 49:17  Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made
 thee waste shall go forth of thee.

ISA 49:18  Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather
 themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt
 surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee,
 as a bride doeth.

ISA 49:19  For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
 destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and
 they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.

ISA 49:20  The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other,
 shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to
 me that I may dwell.

ISA 49:21  Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these,
 seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to
 and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these,
 where had they been?

ISA 49:22  Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the
 Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons
 in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.

ISA 49:23  And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing
 mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and
 lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for
 they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.

ISA 49:24  Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
 delivered?

ISA 49:25  But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be
 taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will
 contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.

ISA 49:26  And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and
 they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh
 shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of
 Jacob.

ISA 50:1  Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement,
 whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you?
 Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your
 transgressions is your mother put away.

ISA 50:2  Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there
 none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I
 no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers
 a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for
 thirst.

ISA 50:3  I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their
 covering.

ISA 50:4  The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should
 know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning
 by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.

ISA 50:5  The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither
 turned away back.

ISA 50:6  I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off
 the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.

ISA 50:7  For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded:
 therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be
 ashamed.

ISA 50:8  He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand
 together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.

ISA 50:9  Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me?
 lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.

ISA 50:10  Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of
 his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust
 in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.

ISA 50:11  Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about
 with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have
 kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.

ISA 51:1  Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the
 LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit
 whence ye are digged.

ISA 51:2  Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I
 called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

ISA 51:3  For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste
 places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the
 garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein,
 thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

ISA 51:4  Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a
 law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light
 of the people.

ISA 51:5  My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms
 shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall
 they trust.

ISA 51:6  Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath:
 for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old
 like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my
 salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

ISA 51:7  Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose
 heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid
 of their revilings.

ISA 51:8  For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat
 them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from
 generation to generation.

ISA 51:9  Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the
 ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut
 Rahab, and wounded the dragon?

ISA 51:10  Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great
 deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass
 over?

ISA 51:11  Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with
 singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall
 obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.

ISA 51:12  I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
 shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which
 shall be made as grass;

ISA 51:13  And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the
 heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually
 every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to
 destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?

ISA 51:14  The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he
 should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.

ISA 51:15  But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared:
 The LORD of hosts is his name.

ISA 51:16  And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the
 shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations
 of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.

ISA 51:17  Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand
 of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of
 trembling, and wrung them out.

ISA 51:18  There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought
 forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that
 she hath brought up.

ISA 51:19  These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee?
 desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I
 comfort thee?

ISA 51:20  Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a
 wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy
 God.

ISA 51:21  Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with
 wine:

ISA 51:22  Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of
 his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even
 the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:

ISA 51:23  But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which
 have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy
 body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.

ISA 52:1  Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful
 garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come
 into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

ISA 52:2  Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose
 thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

ISA 52:3  For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye
 shall be redeemed without money.

ISA 52:4  For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt
 to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.

ISA 52:5  Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is
 taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the
 LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.

ISA 52:6  Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in
 that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.

ISA 52:7  How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth
 good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that
 publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!

ISA 52:8  Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall
 they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again
 Zion.

ISA 52:9  Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem:
 for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

ISA 52:10  The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations;
 and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

ISA 52:11  Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing;
 go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the
 LORD.

ISA 52:12  For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD
 will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.

ISA 52:13  Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and
 extolled, and be very high.

ISA 52:14  As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than
 any man, and his form more than the sons of men:

ISA 52:15  So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths
 at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which
 they had not heard shall they consider.

ISA 53:1  Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD
 revealed?

ISA 53:2  For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out
 of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see
 him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.

ISA 53:3  He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted
 with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we
 esteemed him not.

ISA 53:4  Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did
 esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

ISA 53:5  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
 iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes
 we are healed.

ISA 53:6  All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his
 own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.

ISA 53:7  He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth:
 he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers
 is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.

ISA 53:8  He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his
 generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the
 transgression of my people was he stricken.

ISA 53:9  And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
 death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.

ISA 53:10  Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief:
 when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he
 shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his
 hand.

ISA 53:11  He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by
 his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear
 their iniquities.

ISA 53:12  Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall
 divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto
 death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of
 many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

ISA 54:1  Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into
 singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are
 the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the
 LORD.

ISA 54:2  Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the
 curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen
 thy stakes;

ISA 54:3  For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy
 seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be
 inhabited.

ISA 54:4  Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded;
 for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy
 youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.

ISA 54:5  For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and
 thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be
 called.

ISA 54:6  For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in
 spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.

ISA 54:7  For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will
 I gather thee.

ISA 54:8  In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with
 everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.

ISA 54:9  For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that
 the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I
 would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.

ISA 54:10  For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my
 kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace
 be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.

ISA 54:11  O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I
 will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with
 sapphires.

ISA 54:12  And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles,
 and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

ISA 54:13  And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be
 the peace of thy children.

ISA 54:14  In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from
 oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come
 near thee.

ISA 54:15  Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever
 shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.

ISA 54:16  Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
 fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created
 the waster to destroy.

ISA 54:17  No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every
 tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is
 the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me,
 saith the LORD.

ISA 55:1  Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath
 no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money
 and without price.

ISA 55:2  Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your
 labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye
 that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.

ISA 55:3  Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live;
 and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of
 David.

ISA 55:4  Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and
 commander to the people.

ISA 55:5  Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations
 that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for
 the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.

ISA 55:6  Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is
 near:

ISA 55:7  Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
 and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our
 God, for he will abundantly pardon.

ISA 55:8  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
 saith the LORD.

ISA 55:9  For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher
 than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

ISA 55:10  For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth
 not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that
 it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:

ISA 55:11  So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not
 return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it
 shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

ISA 55:12  For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the
 mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all
 the trees of the field shall clap their hands.

ISA 55:13  Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the
 brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name,
 for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.

ISA 56:1  Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my
 salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.

ISA 56:2  Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth
 hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand
 from doing any evil.

ISA 56:3  Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the
 LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people:
 neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.

ISA 56:4  For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and
 choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;

ISA 56:5  Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place
 and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an
 everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.

ISA 56:6  Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to
 serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one
 that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;

ISA 56:7  Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in
 my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be
 accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer
 for all people.

ISA 56:8  The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will
 I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.

ISA 56:9  All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the
 forest.

ISA 56:10  His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb
 dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.

ISA 56:11  Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are
 shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one
 for his gain, from his quarter.

ISA 56:12  Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves
 with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more
 abundant.

ISA 57:1  The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful
 men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from
 the evil to come.

ISA 57:2  He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one
 walking in his uprightness.

ISA 57:3  But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the
 adulterer and the whore.

ISA 57:4  Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide
 mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed
 of falsehood.

ISA 57:5  Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the
 children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?

ISA 57:6  Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are
 thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a
 meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?

ISA 57:7  Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither
 wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.

ISA 57:8  Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance:
 for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou
 hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their
 bed where thou sawest it.

ISA 57:9  And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy
 perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself
 even unto hell.

ISA 57:10  Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not,
 There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast
 not grieved.

ISA 57:11  And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast
 lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held
 my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?

ISA 57:12  I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not
 profit thee.

ISA 57:13  When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall
 carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in
 me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;

ISA 57:14  And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the
 stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

ISA 57:15  For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,
 whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is
 of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to
 revive the heart of the contrite ones.

ISA 57:16  For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for
 the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.

ISA 57:17  For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I
 hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.

ISA 57:18  I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and
 restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

ISA 57:19  I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far
 off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.

ISA 57:20  But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose
 waters cast up mire and dirt.

ISA 57:21  There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

ISA 58:1  Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my
 people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.

ISA 58:2  Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that
 did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me
 the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.

ISA 58:3  Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore
 have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day
 of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.

ISA 58:4  Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of
 wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be
 heard on high.

ISA 58:5  Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his
 soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and
 ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the
 LORD?

ISA 58:6  Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of
 wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and
 that ye break every yoke?

ISA 58:7  Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the
 poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou
 cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?

ISA 58:8  Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health
 shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the
 glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.

ISA 58:9  Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and
 he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the
 yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;

ISA 58:10  And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
 afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be
 as the noon day:

ISA 58:11  And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in
 drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and
 like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.

ISA 58:12  And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places:
 thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be
 called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.

ISA 58:13  If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure
 on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD,
 honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine
 own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:

ISA 58:14  Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee
 to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of
 Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

ISA 59:1  Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;
 neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:

ISA 59:2  But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your
 sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.

ISA 59:3  For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
 iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.

ISA 59:4  None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in
 vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.

ISA 59:5  They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that
 eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a
 viper.

ISA 59:6  Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
 themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act
 of violence is in their hands.

ISA 59:7  Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood:
 their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their
 paths.

ISA 59:8  The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their
 goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not
 know peace.

ISA 59:9  Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us:
 we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in
 darkness.

ISA 59:10  We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no
 eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as
 dead men.

ISA 59:11  We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for
 judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.

ISA 59:12  For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins
 testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our
 iniquities, we know them;

ISA 59:13  In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from
 our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the
 heart words of falsehood.

ISA 59:14  And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off:
 for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.

ISA 59:15  Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a
 prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.

ISA 59:16  And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no
 intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his
 righteousness, it sustained him.

ISA 59:17  For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of
 salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for
 clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.

ISA 59:18  According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his
 adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay
 recompence.

ISA 59:19  So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory
 from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the
 Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.

ISA 59:20  And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from
 transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.

ISA 59:21  As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit
 that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not
 depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the
 mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.

ISA 60:1  Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is
 risen upon thee.

ISA 60:2  For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness
 the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen
 upon thee.

ISA 60:3  And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness
 of thy rising.

ISA 60:4  Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves
 together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters
 shall be nursed at thy side.

ISA 60:5  Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall
 fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted
 unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.

ISA 60:6  The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian
 and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense;
 and they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD.

ISA 60:7  All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the
 rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance
 on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.

ISA 60:8  Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?

ISA 60:9  Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first,
 to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the
 name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath
 glorified thee.

ISA 60:10  And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings
 shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have
 I had mercy on thee.

ISA 60:11  Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be
 shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles,
 and that their kings may be brought.

ISA 60:12  For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish;
 yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.

ISA 60:13  The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine
 tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will
 make the place of my feet glorious.

ISA 60:14  The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto
 thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles
 of thy feet; and they shall call thee; The city of the LORD, The Zion of the
 Holy One of Israel.

ISA 60:15  Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went
 through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many
 generations.

ISA 60:16  Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the
 breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy
 Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

ISA 60:17  For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and
 for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and
 thine exactors righteousness.

ISA 60:18  Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction
 within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates
 Praise.

ISA 60:19  The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness
 shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an
 everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.

ISA 60:20  Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw
 itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy
 mourning shall be ended.

ISA 60:21  Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land
 for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be
 glorified.

ISA 60:22  A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong
 nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.

ISA 61:1  The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed
 me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the
 brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the
 prison to them that are bound;

ISA 61:2  To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance
 of our God; to comfort all that mourn;

ISA 61:3  To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for
 ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of
 heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting
 of the LORD, that he might be glorified.

ISA 61:4  And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former
 desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many
 generations.

ISA 61:5  And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the
 alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

ISA 61:6  But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the
 Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their
 glory shall ye boast yourselves.

ISA 61:7  For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall
 rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the
 double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.

ISA 61:8  For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and
 I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant
 with them.

ISA 61:9  And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring
 among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the
 seed which the LORD hath blessed.

ISA 61:10  I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my
 God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered
 me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with
 ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.

ISA 61:11  For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth
 the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause
 righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

ISA 62:1  For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I
 will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and
 the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.

ISA 62:2  And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy
 glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD
 shall name.

ISA 62:3  Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a
 royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

ISA 62:4  Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any
 more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land
 Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.

ISA 62:5  For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee:
 and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over
 thee.

ISA 62:6  I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never
 hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not
 silence,

ISA 62:7  And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a
 praise in the earth.

ISA 62:8  The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his
 strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies;
 and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou
 hast laboured:

ISA 62:9  But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and
 they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my
 holiness.

ISA 62:10  Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people;
 cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for
 the people.

ISA 62:11  Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye
 to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is
 with him, and his work before him.

ISA 62:12  And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD:
 and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.

ISA 63:1  Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?
 this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his
 strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.

ISA 63:2  Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him
 that treadeth in the winefat?

ISA 63:3  I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none
 with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury;
 and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my
 raiment.

ISA 63:4  For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my
 redeemed is come.

ISA 63:5  And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there
 was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my
 fury, it upheld me.

ISA 63:6  And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk
 in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.

ISA 63:7  I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises
 of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the
 great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them
 according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his
 lovingkindnesses.

ISA 63:8  For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie:
 so he was their Saviour.

ISA 63:9  In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
 presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he
 bare them, and carried them all the days of old.

ISA 63:10  But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was
 turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.

ISA 63:11  Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying,
 Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his
 flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?

ISA 63:12  That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm,
 dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?

ISA 63:13  That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that
 they should not stumble?

ISA 63:14  As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused
 him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.

ISA 63:15  Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
 holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding
 of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?

ISA 63:16  Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and
 Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer; thy
 name is from everlasting.

ISA 63:17  O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our
 heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine
 inheritance.

ISA 63:18  The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our
 adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.

ISA 63:19  We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called
 by thy name.

ISA 64:1  Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down,
 that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,

ISA 64:2  As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to
 boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may
 tremble at thy presence!

ISA 64:3  When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest
 down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.

ISA 64:4  For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor
 perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he
 hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.

ISA 64:5  Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that
 remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in
 those is continuance, and we shall be saved.

ISA 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are
 as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the
 wind, have taken us away.

ISA 64:7  And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up
 himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast
 consumed us, because of our iniquities.

ISA 64:8  But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our
 potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.

ISA 64:9  Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever:
 behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.

ISA 64:10  Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a
 desolation.

ISA 64:11  Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is
 burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.

ISA 64:12  Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold
 thy peace, and afflict us very sore?

ISA 65:1  I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that
 sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not
 called by my name.

ISA 65:2  I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people,
 which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;

ISA 65:3  A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that
 sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;

ISA 65:4  Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat
 swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;

ISA 65:5  Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier
 than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.

ISA 65:6  Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will
 recompense, even recompense into their bosom,

ISA 65:7  Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith
 the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me
 upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.

ISA 65:8  Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one
 saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants'
 sakes, that I may not destroy them all.

ISA 65:9  And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an
 inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants
 shall dwell there.

ISA 65:10  And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a
 place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.

ISA 65:11  But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain,
 that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto
 that number.

ISA 65:12  Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down
 to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye
 did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I
 delighted not.

ISA 65:13  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat,
 but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be
 thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:

ISA 65:14  Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry
 for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.

ISA 65:15  And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the
 Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:

ISA 65:16  That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the
 God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of
 truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid
 from mine eyes.

ISA 65:17  For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former
 shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.

ISA 65:18  But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for,
 behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

ISA 65:19  And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice
 of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.

ISA 65:20  There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that
 hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but
 the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.

ISA 65:21  And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant
 vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

ISA 65:22  They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and
 another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine
 elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.

ISA 65:23  They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they
 are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.

ISA 65:24  And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and
 while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

ISA 65:25  The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat
 straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not
 hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.

ISA 66:1  Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my
 footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place
 of my rest?

ISA 66:2  For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have
 been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor
 and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.

ISA 66:3  He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a
 lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he
 offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol.
 Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their
 abominations.

ISA 66:4  I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon
 them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not
 hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted
 not.

ISA 66:5  Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren
 that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be
 glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.

ISA 66:6  A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice
 of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.

ISA 66:7  Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she
 was delivered of a man child.

ISA 66:8  Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the
 earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once?
 for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.

ISA 66:9  Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the
 LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.

ISA 66:10  Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love
 her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:

ISA 66:11  That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her
 consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of
 her glory.

ISA 66:12  For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a
 river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye
 suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.

ISA 66:13  As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye
 shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

ISA 66:14  And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall
 flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his
 servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.

ISA 66:15  For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots
 like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames
 of fire.

ISA 66:16  For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and
 the slain of the LORD shall be many.

ISA 66:17  They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens
 behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and
 the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.

ISA 66:18  For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I
 will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.

ISA 66:19  And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape
 of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to
 Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither
 have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.

ISA 66:20  And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD
 out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon
 mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD,
 as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house
 of the LORD.

ISA 66:21  And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the
 LORD.

ISA 66:22  For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall
 remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.

ISA 66:23  And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and
 from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith
 the LORD.

ISA 66:24  And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that
 have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall
 their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.

```
JOB 1:1  There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man
 was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.

JOB 1:2  And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.

JOB 1:3  His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand
 camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very
 great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the
 east.

JOB 1:4  And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and
 sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.

JOB 1:5  And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that
 Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered
 burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be
 that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job
 continually.

JOB 1:6  Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
 before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.

JOB 1:7  And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered
 the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up
 and down in it.

JOB 1:8  And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
 that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
 that feareth God, and escheweth evil?

JOB 1:9  Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?

JOB 1:10  Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about
 all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and
 his substance is increased in the land.

JOB 1:11  But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will
 curse thee to thy face.

JOB 1:12  And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy
 power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from
 the presence of the LORD.

JOB 1:13  And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and
 drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:

JOB 1:14  And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
 plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:

JOB 1:15  And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have
 slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to
 tell thee.

JOB 1:16  While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
 fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the
 servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

JOB 1:17  While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
 Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried
 them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only
 am escaped alone to tell thee.

JOB 1:18  While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy
 sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest
 brother's house:

JOB 1:19  And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote
 the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are
 dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

JOB 1:20  Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell
 down upon the ground, and worshipped,

JOB 1:21  And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I
 return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the
 name of the LORD.

JOB 1:22  In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

JOB 2:1  Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
 before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the
 LORD.

JOB 2:2  And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan
 answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from
 walking up and down in it.

JOB 2:3  And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
 that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
 that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his
 integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without
 cause.

JOB 2:4  And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a
 man hath will he give for his life.

JOB 2:5  But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he
 will curse thee to thy face.

JOB 2:6  And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save
 his life.

JOB 2:7  So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with
 sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.

JOB 2:8  And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down
 among the ashes.

JOB 2:9  Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?
 curse God, and die.

JOB 2:10  But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women
 speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not
 receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.

JOB 2:11  Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come
 upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and
 Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an
 appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.

JOB 2:12  And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they
 lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and
 sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.

JOB 2:13  So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
 nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very
 great.

JOB 3:1  After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

JOB 3:2  And Job spake, and said,

JOB 3:3  Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was
 said, There is a man child conceived.

JOB 3:4  Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither
 let the light shine upon it.

JOB 3:5  Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon
 it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

JOB 3:6  As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined
 unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.

JOB 3:7  Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.

JOB 3:8  Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their
 mourning.

JOB 3:9  Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light,
 but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:

JOB 3:10  Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow
 from mine eyes.

JOB 3:11  Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I
 came out of the belly?

JOB 3:12  Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?

JOB 3:13  For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept:
 then had I been at rest,

JOB 3:14  With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places
 for themselves;

JOB 3:15  Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:

JOB 3:16  Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never
 saw light.

JOB 3:17  There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at
 rest.

JOB 3:18  There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the
 oppressor.

JOB 3:19  The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his
 master.

JOB 3:20  Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the
 bitter in soul;

JOB 3:21  Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for
 hid treasures;

JOB 3:22  Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the
 grave?

JOB 3:23  Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath
 hedged in?

JOB 3:24  For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out
 like the waters.

JOB 3:25  For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which
 I was afraid of is come unto me.

JOB 3:26  I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet
 trouble came.

JOB 4:1  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

JOB 4:2  If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can
 withhold himself from speaking?

JOB 4:3  Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak
 hands.

JOB 4:4  Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
 strengthened the feeble knees.

JOB 4:5  But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and
 thou art troubled.

JOB 4:6  Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of
 thy ways?

JOB 4:7  Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where
 were the righteous cut off?

JOB 4:8  Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap
 the same.

JOB 4:9  By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are
 they consumed.

JOB 4:10  The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the
 teeth of the young lions, are broken.

JOB 4:11  The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps
 are scattered abroad.

JOB 4:12  Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a
 little thereof.

JOB 4:13  In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on
 men,

JOB 4:14  Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.

JOB 4:15  Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:

JOB 4:16  It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image
 was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,

JOB 4:17  Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than
 his maker?

JOB 4:18  Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged
 with folly:

JOB 4:19  How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation
 is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?

JOB 4:20  They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever
 without any regarding it.

JOB 4:21  Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even
 without wisdom.

JOB 5:1  Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the
 saints wilt thou turn?

JOB 5:2  For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.

JOB 5:3  I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
 habitation.

JOB 5:4  His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate,
 neither is there any to deliver them.

JOB 5:5  Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the
 thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.

JOB 5:6  Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble
 spring out of the ground;

JOB 5:7  Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

JOB 5:8  I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:

JOB 5:9  Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without
 number:

JOB 5:10  Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:

JOB 5:11  To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be
 exalted to safety.

JOB 5:12  He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands
 cannot perform their enterprise.

JOB 5:13  He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the
 froward is carried headlong.

JOB 5:14  They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as
 in the night.

JOB 5:15  But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the
 hand of the mighty.

JOB 5:16  So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

JOB 5:17  Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not
 thou the chastening of the Almighty:

JOB 5:18  For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make
 whole.

JOB 5:19  He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no
 evil touch thee.

JOB 5:20  In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power
 of the sword.

JOB 5:21  Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou
 be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

JOB 5:22  At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be
 afraid of the beasts of the earth.

JOB 5:23  For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the
 beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

JOB 5:24  And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou
 shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.

JOB 5:25  Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
 offspring as the grass of the earth.

JOB 5:26  Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn
 cometh in in his season.

JOB 5:27  Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for
 thy good.

JOB 6:1  But Job answered and said,

JOB 6:2  Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the
 balances together!

JOB 6:3  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my
 words are swallowed up.

JOB 6:4  For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof
 drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against
 me.

JOB 6:5  Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his
 fodder?

JOB 6:6  Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any
 taste in the white of an egg?

JOB 6:7  The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.

JOB 6:8  Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing
 that I long for!

JOB 6:9  Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose
 his hand, and cut me off!

JOB 6:10  Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow:
 let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.

JOB 6:11  What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I
 should prolong my life?

JOB 6:12  Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?

JOB 6:13  Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

JOB 6:14  To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but
 he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

JOB 6:15  My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of
 brooks they pass away;

JOB 6:16  Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:

JOB 6:17  What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are
 consumed out of their place.

JOB 6:18  The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and
 perish.

JOB 6:19  The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.

JOB 6:20  They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and
 were ashamed.

JOB 6:21  For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.

JOB 6:22  Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?

JOB 6:23  Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand
 of the mighty?

JOB 6:24  Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand
 wherein I have erred.

JOB 6:25  How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?

JOB 6:26  Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is
 desperate, which are as wind?

JOB 6:27  Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.

JOB 6:28  Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if
 I lie.

JOB 6:29  Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my
 righteousness is in it.

JOB 6:30  Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse
 things?

JOB 7:1  Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days
 also like the days of an hireling?

JOB 7:2  As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh
 for the reward of his work:

JOB 7:3  So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are
 appointed to me.

JOB 7:4  When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and
 I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.

JOB 7:5  My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
 broken, and become loathsome.

JOB 7:6  My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without
 hope.

JOB 7:7  O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.

JOB 7:8  The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are
 upon me, and I am not.

JOB 7:9  As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down
 to the grave shall come up no more.

JOB 7:10  He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know
 him any more.

JOB 7:11  Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of
 my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

JOB 7:12  Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?

JOB 7:13  When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my
 complaints;

JOB 7:14  Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:

JOB 7:15  So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.

JOB 7:16  I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are
 vanity.

JOB 7:17  What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest
 set thine heart upon him?

JOB 7:18  And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every
 moment?

JOB 7:19  How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I
 swallow down my spittle?

JOB 7:20  I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?
 why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?

JOB 7:21  And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my
 iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the
 morning, but I shall not be.

JOB 8:1  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

JOB 8:2  How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of
 thy mouth be like a strong wind?

JOB 8:3  Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?

JOB 8:4  If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away
 for their transgression;

JOB 8:5  If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication
 to the Almighty;

JOB 8:6  If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and
 make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

JOB 8:7  Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly
 increase.

JOB 8:8  For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself
 to the search of their fathers:

JOB 8:9  (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon
 earth are a shadow:)

JOB 8:10  Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out
 of their heart?

JOB 8:11  Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?

JOB 8:12  Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth
 before any other herb.

JOB 8:13  So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope
 shall perish:

JOB 8:14  Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.

JOB 8:15  He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold
 it fast, but it shall not endure.

JOB 8:16  He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his
 garden.

JOB 8:17  His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.

JOB 8:18  If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I
 have not seen thee.

JOB 8:19  Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others
 grow.

JOB 8:20  Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help
 the evil doers:

JOB 8:21  Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.

JOB 8:22  They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling
 place of the wicked shall come to nought.

JOB 9:1  Then Job answered and said,

JOB 9:2  I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?

JOB 9:3  If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.

JOB 9:4  He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself
 against him, and hath prospered?

JOB 9:5  Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth
 them in his anger.

JOB 9:6  Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof
 tremble.

JOB 9:7  Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.

JOB 9:8  Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves
 of the sea.

JOB 9:9  Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the
 south.

JOB 9:10  Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without
 number.

JOB 9:11  Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I
 perceive him not.

JOB 9:12  Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him,
 What doest thou?

JOB 9:13  If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under
 him.

JOB 9:14  How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason
 with him?

JOB 9:15  Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would
 make supplication to my judge.

JOB 9:16  If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that
 he had hearkened unto my voice.

JOB 9:17  For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without
 cause.

JOB 9:18  He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
 bitterness.

JOB 9:19  If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who
 shall set me a time to plead?

JOB 9:20  If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am
 perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

JOB 9:21  Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise
 my life.

JOB 9:22  This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and
 the wicked.

JOB 9:23  If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the
 innocent.

JOB 9:24  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces
 of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?

JOB 9:25  Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no
 good.

JOB 9:26  They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth
 to the prey.

JOB 9:27  If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness,
 and comfort myself:

JOB 9:28  I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me
 innocent.

JOB 9:29  If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?

JOB 9:30  If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;

JOB 9:31  Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall
 abhor me.

JOB 9:32  For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should
 come together in judgment.

JOB 9:33  Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon
 us both.

JOB 9:34  Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:

JOB 9:35  Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.

JOB 10:1  My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I
 will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

JOB 10:2  I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
 contendest with me.

JOB 10:3  Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest
 despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?

JOB 10:4  Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?

JOB 10:5  Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,

JOB 10:6  That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?

JOB 10:7  Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver
 out of thine hand.

JOB 10:8  Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet
 thou dost destroy me.

JOB 10:9  Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and
 wilt thou bring me into dust again?

JOB 10:10  Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?

JOB 10:11  Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with
 bones and sinews.

JOB 10:12  Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
 preserved my spirit.

JOB 10:13  And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is
 with thee.

JOB 10:14  If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from
 mine iniquity.

JOB 10:15  If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not
 lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;

JOB 10:16  For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou
 shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

JOB 10:17  Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
 indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.

JOB 10:18  Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I
 had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!

JOB 10:19  I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been
 carried from the womb to the grave.

JOB 10:20  Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take
 comfort a little,

JOB 10:21  Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness
 and the shadow of death;

JOB 10:22  A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death,
 without any order, and where the light is as darkness.

JOB 11:1  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

JOB 11:2  Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full
 of talk be justified?

JOB 11:3  Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest,
 shall no man make thee ashamed?

JOB 11:4  For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine
 eyes.

JOB 11:5  But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;

JOB 11:6  And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are
 double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than
 thine iniquity deserveth.

JOB 11:7  Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
 Almighty unto perfection?

JOB 11:8  It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what
 canst thou know?

JOB 11:9  The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the
 sea.

JOB 11:10  If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder
 him?

JOB 11:11  For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then
 consider it?

JOB 11:12  For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's
 colt.

JOB 11:13  If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;

JOB 11:14  If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not
 wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

JOB 11:15  For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt
 be stedfast, and shalt not fear:

JOB 11:16  Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that
 pass away:

JOB 11:17  And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine
 forth, thou shalt be as the morning.

JOB 11:18  And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig
 about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

JOB 11:19  Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many
 shall make suit unto thee.

JOB 11:20  But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not
 escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.

JOB 12:1  And Job answered and said,

JOB 12:2  No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

JOB 12:3  But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you:
 yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

JOB 12:4  I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he
 answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.

JOB 12:5  He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the
 thought of him that is at ease.

JOB 12:6  The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are
 secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.

JOB 12:7  But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls
 of the air, and they shall tell thee:

JOB 12:8  Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the
 sea shall declare unto thee.

JOB 12:9  Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought
 this?

JOB 12:10  In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of
 all mankind.

JOB 12:11  Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

JOB 12:12  With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.

JOB 12:13  With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.

JOB 12:14  Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth
 up a man, and there can be no opening.

JOB 12:15  Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth
 them out, and they overturn the earth.

JOB 12:16  With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are
 his.

JOB 12:17  He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.

JOB 12:18  He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.

JOB 12:19  He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

JOB 12:20  He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
 understanding of the aged.

JOB 12:21  He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the
 mighty.

JOB 12:22  He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to
 light the shadow of death.

JOB 12:23  He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the
 nations, and straiteneth them again.

JOB 12:24  He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
 earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.

JOB 12:25  They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger
 like a drunken man.

JOB 13:1  Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood
 it.

JOB 13:2  What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.

JOB 13:3  Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with
 God.

JOB 13:4  But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.

JOB 13:5  O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your
 wisdom.

JOB 13:6  Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.

JOB 13:7  Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

JOB 13:8  Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?

JOB 13:9  Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh
 another, do ye so mock him?

JOB 13:10  He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.

JOB 13:11  Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon
 you?

JOB 13:12  Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of
 clay.

JOB 13:13  Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me
 what will.

JOB 13:14  Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine
 hand?

JOB 13:15  Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine
 own ways before him.

JOB 13:16  He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
 before him.

JOB 13:17  Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

JOB 13:18  Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be
 justified.

JOB 13:19  Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I
 shall give up the ghost.

JOB 13:20  Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from
 thee.

JOB 13:21  Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
 afraid.

JOB 13:22  Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou
 me.

JOB 13:23  How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
 transgression and my sin.

JOB 13:24  Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?

JOB 13:25  Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the
 dry stubble?

JOB 13:26  For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess
 the iniquities of my youth.

JOB 13:27  Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto
 all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.

JOB 13:28  And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth
 eaten.

JOB 14:1  Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.

JOB 14:2  He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a
 shadow, and continueth not.

JOB 14:3  And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into
 judgment with thee?

JOB 14:4  Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.

JOB 14:5  Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with
 thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;

JOB 14:6  Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an
 hireling, his day.

JOB 14:7  For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout
 again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.

JOB 14:8  Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof
 die in the ground;

JOB 14:9  Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs
 like a plant.

JOB 14:10  But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and
 where is he?

JOB 14:11  As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth
 up:

JOB 14:12  So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they
 shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

JOB 14:13  O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep
 me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set
 time, and remember me!

JOB 14:14  If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time
 will I wait, till my change come.

JOB 14:15  Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire
 to the work of thine hands.

JOB 14:16  For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?

JOB 14:17  My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine
 iniquity.

JOB 14:18  And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock is
 removed out of his place.

JOB 14:19  The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow
 out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.

JOB 14:20  Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest
 his countenance, and sendest him away.

JOB 14:21  His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought
 low, but he perceiveth it not of them.

JOB 14:22  But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him
 shall mourn.

JOB 15:1  Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,

JOB 15:2  Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the
 east wind?

JOB 15:3  Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith
 he can do no good?

JOB 15:4  Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.

JOB 15:5  For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue
 of the crafty.

JOB 15:6  Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips
 testify against thee.

JOB 15:7  Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the
 hills?

JOB 15:8  Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to
 thyself?

JOB 15:9  What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which
 is not in us?

JOB 15:10  With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than
 thy father.

JOB 15:11  Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret
 thing with thee?

JOB 15:12  Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,

JOB 15:13  That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go
 out of thy mouth?

JOB 15:14  What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a
 woman, that he should be righteous?

JOB 15:15  Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not
 clean in his sight.

JOB 15:16  How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity
 like water?

JOB 15:17  I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will
 declare;

JOB 15:18  Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:

JOB 15:19  Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among
 them.

JOB 15:20  The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of
 years is hidden to the oppressor.

JOB 15:21  A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall
 come upon him.

JOB 15:22  He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is
 waited for of the sword.

JOB 15:23  He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that
 the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

JOB 15:24  Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
 against him, as a king ready to the battle.

JOB 15:25  For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth
 himself against the Almighty.

JOB 15:26  He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his
 bucklers:

JOB 15:27  Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of
 fat on his flanks.

JOB 15:28  And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man
 inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.

JOB 15:29  He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither
 shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.

JOB 15:30  He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his
 branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.

JOB 15:31  Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be
 his recompence.

JOB 15:32  It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not
 be green.

JOB 15:33  He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off
 his flower as the olive.

JOB 15:34  For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall
 consume the tabernacles of bribery.

JOB 15:35  They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly
 prepareth deceit.

JOB 16:1  Then Job answered and said,

JOB 16:2  I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.

JOB 16:3  Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou
 answerest?

JOB 16:4  I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I
 could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.

JOB 16:5  But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips
 should asswage your grief.

JOB 16:6  Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what
 am I eased?

JOB 16:7  But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my
 company.

JOB 16:8  And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me:
 and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.

JOB 16:9  He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with
 his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

JOB 16:10  They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon
 the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.

JOB 16:11  God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the
 hands of the wicked.

JOB 16:12  I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me
 by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.

JOB 16:13  His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
 asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.

JOB 16:14  He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a
 giant.

JOB 16:15  I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the
 dust.

JOB 16:16  My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of
 death;

JOB 16:17  Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.

JOB 16:18  O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.

JOB 16:19  Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.

JOB 16:20  My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.

JOB 16:21  O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his
 neighbour!

JOB 16:22  When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall
 not return.

JOB 17:1  My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for
 me.

JOB 17:2  Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue
 in their provocation?

JOB 17:3  Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will
 strike hands with me?

JOB 17:4  For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt
 thou not exalt them.

JOB 17:5  He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his
 children shall fail.

JOB 17:6  He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a
 tabret.

JOB 17:7  Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a
 shadow.

JOB 17:8  Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up
 himself against the hypocrite.

JOB 17:9  The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean
 hands shall be stronger and stronger.

JOB 17:10  But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find
 one wise man among you.

JOB 17:11  My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of
 my heart.

JOB 17:12  They change the night into day: the light is short because of
 darkness.

JOB 17:13  If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the
 darkness.

JOB 17:14  I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art
 my mother, and my sister.

JOB 17:15  And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?

JOB 17:16  They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is
 in the dust.

JOB 18:1  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

JOB 18:2  How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards
 we will speak.

JOB 18:3  Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?

JOB 18:4  He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for
 thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

JOB 18:5  Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his
 fire shall not shine.

JOB 18:6  The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be
 put out with him.

JOB 18:7  The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel
 shall cast him down.

JOB 18:8  For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a
 snare.

JOB 18:9  The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail
 against him.

JOB 18:10  The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the
 way.

JOB 18:11  Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to
 his feet.

JOB 18:12  His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready
 at his side.

JOB 18:13  It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of
 death shall devour his strength.

JOB 18:14  His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall
 bring him to the king of terrors.

JOB 18:15  It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
 brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

JOB 18:16  His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be
 cut off.

JOB 18:17  His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no
 name in the street.

JOB 18:18  He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the
 world.

JOB 18:19  He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any
 remaining in his dwellings.

JOB 18:20  They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that
 went before were affrighted.

JOB 18:21  Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place
 of him that knoweth not God.

JOB 19:1  Then Job answered and said,

JOB 19:2  How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?

JOB 19:3  These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye
 make yourselves strange to me.

JOB 19:4  And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.

JOB 19:5  If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me
 my reproach:

JOB 19:6  Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his
 net.

JOB 19:7  Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but
 there is no judgment.

JOB 19:8  He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness
 in my paths.

JOB 19:9  He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.

JOB 19:10  He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope
 hath he removed like a tree.

JOB 19:11  He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto
 him as one of his enemies.

JOB 19:12  His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and
 encamp round about my tabernacle.

JOB 19:13  He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are
 verily estranged from me.

JOB 19:14  My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.

JOB 19:15  They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a
 stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

JOB 19:16  I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with
 my mouth.

JOB 19:17  My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the
 children's sake of mine own body.

JOB 19:18  Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.

JOB 19:19  All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned
 against me.

JOB 19:20  My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with
 the skin of my teeth.

JOB 19:21  Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand
 of God hath touched me.

JOB 19:22  Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?

JOB 19:23  Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a
 book!

JOB 19:24  That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for
 ever!

JOB 19:25  For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the
 latter day upon the earth:

JOB 19:26  And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh
 shall I see God:

JOB 19:27  Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not
 another; though my reins be consumed within me.

JOB 19:28  But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the
 matter is found in me?

JOB 19:29  Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the
 sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.

JOB 20:1  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

JOB 20:2  Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make
 haste.

JOB 20:3  I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
 understanding causeth me to answer.

JOB 20:4  Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,

JOB 20:5  That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
 hypocrite but for a moment?

JOB 20:6  Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach
 unto the clouds;

JOB 20:7  Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen
 him shall say, Where is he?

JOB 20:8  He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall
 be chased away as a vision of the night.

JOB 20:9  The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his
 place any more behold him.

JOB 20:10  His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall
 restore their goods.

JOB 20:11  His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down
 with him in the dust.

JOB 20:12  Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his
 tongue;

JOB 20:13  Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his
 mouth:

JOB 20:14  Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within
 him.

JOB 20:15  He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God
 shall cast them out of his belly.

JOB 20:16  He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.

JOB 20:17  He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and
 butter.

JOB 20:18  That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow
 it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall
 not rejoice therein.

JOB 20:19  Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he
 hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;

JOB 20:20  Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save
 of that which he desired.

JOB 20:21  There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look
 for his goods.

JOB 20:22  In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand
 of the wicked shall come upon him.

JOB 20:23  When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his
 wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.

JOB 20:24  He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall
 strike him through.

JOB 20:25  It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword
 cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.

JOB 20:26  All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown
 shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.

JOB 20:27  The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up
 against him.

JOB 20:28  The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow
 away in the day of his wrath.

JOB 20:29  This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
 appointed unto him by God.

JOB 21:1  But Job answered and said,

JOB 21:2  Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.

JOB 21:3  Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.

JOB 21:4  As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not
 my spirit be troubled?

JOB 21:5  Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.

JOB 21:6  Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my
 flesh.

JOB 21:7  Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?

JOB 21:8  Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their
 offspring before their eyes.

JOB 21:9  Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.

JOB 21:10  Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and
 casteth not her calf.

JOB 21:11  They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children
 dance.

JOB 21:12  They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the
 organ.

JOB 21:13  They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the
 grave.

JOB 21:14  Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the
 knowledge of thy ways.

JOB 21:15  What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit
 should we have, if we pray unto him?

JOB 21:16  Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is
 far from me.

JOB 21:17  How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh
 their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.

JOB 21:18  They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm
 carrieth away.

JOB 21:19  God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and
 he shall know it.

JOB 21:20  His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath
 of the Almighty.

JOB 21:21  For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of
 his months is cut off in the midst?

JOB 21:22  Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are
 high.

JOB 21:23  One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.

JOB 21:24  His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with
 marrow.

JOB 21:25  And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth
 with pleasure.

JOB 21:26  They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover
 them.

JOB 21:27  Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully
 imagine against me.

JOB 21:28  For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the
 dwelling places of the wicked?

JOB 21:29  Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their
 tokens,

JOB 21:30  That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be
 brought forth to the day of wrath.

JOB 21:31  Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what
 he hath done?

JOB 21:32  Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.

JOB 21:33  The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall
 draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.

JOB 21:34  How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there
 remaineth falsehood?

JOB 22:1  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

JOB 22:2  Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
 profitable unto himself?

JOB 22:3  Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it
 gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?

JOB 22:4  Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into
 judgment?

JOB 22:5  Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?

JOB 22:6  For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and
 stripped the naked of their clothing.

JOB 22:7  Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast
 withholden bread from the hungry.

JOB 22:8  But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man
 dwelt in it.

JOB 22:9  Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have
 been broken.

JOB 22:10  Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth
 thee;

JOB 22:11  Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover
 thee.

JOB 22:12  Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the
 stars, how high they are!

JOB 22:13  And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark
 cloud?

JOB 22:14  Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he
 walketh in the circuit of heaven.

JOB 22:15  Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?

JOB 22:16  Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with
 a flood:

JOB 22:17  Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do
 for them?

JOB 22:18  Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the
 wicked is far from me.

JOB 22:19  The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to
 scorn.

JOB 22:20  Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the
 fire consumeth.

JOB 22:21  Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall
 come unto thee.

JOB 22:22  Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words
 in thine heart.

JOB 22:23  If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt
 put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.

JOB 22:24  Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the
 stones of the brooks.

JOB 22:25  Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty
 of silver.

JOB 22:26  For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift
 up thy face unto God.

JOB 22:27  Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and
 thou shalt pay thy vows.

JOB 22:28  Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto
 thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.

JOB 22:29  When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up;
 and he shall save the humble person.

JOB 22:30  He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by
 the pureness of thine hands.

JOB 23:1  Then Job answered and said,

JOB 23:2  Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my
 groaning.

JOB 23:3  Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his
 seat!

JOB 23:4  I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.

JOB 23:5  I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what
 he would say unto me.

JOB 23:6  Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put
 strength in me.

JOB 23:7  There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered
 for ever from my judge.

JOB 23:8  Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot
 perceive him:

JOB 23:9  On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he
 hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:

JOB 23:10  But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall
 come forth as gold.

JOB 23:11  My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.

JOB 23:12  Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have
 esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.

JOB 23:13  But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul
 desireth, even that he doeth.

JOB 23:14  For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such
 things are with him.

JOB 23:15  Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am
 afraid of him.

JOB 23:16  For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:

JOB 23:17  Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he
 covered the darkness from my face.

JOB 24:1  Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know
 him not see his days?

JOB 24:2  Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed
 thereof.

JOB 24:3  They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox
 for a pledge.

JOB 24:4  They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
 themselves together.

JOB 24:5  Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work;
 rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for
 their children.

JOB 24:6  They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the
 vintage of the wicked.

JOB 24:7  They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no
 covering in the cold.

JOB 24:8  They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock
 for want of a shelter.

JOB 24:9  They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the
 poor.

JOB 24:10  They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the
 sheaf from the hungry;

JOB 24:11  Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and
 suffer thirst.

JOB 24:12  Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth
 out: yet God layeth not folly to them.

JOB 24:13  They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the
 ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

JOB 24:14  The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and
 in the night is as a thief.

JOB 24:15  The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No
 eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.

JOB 24:16  In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for
 themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.

JOB 24:17  For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know
 them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.

JOB 24:18  He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he
 beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

JOB 24:19  Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those
 which have sinned.

JOB 24:20  The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he
 shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.

JOB 24:21  He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good
 to the widow.

JOB 24:22  He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man
 is sure of life.

JOB 24:23  Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his
 eyes are upon their ways.

JOB 24:24  They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low;
 they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the
 ears of corn.

JOB 24:25  And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech
 nothing worth?

JOB 25:1  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

JOB 25:2  Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.

JOB 25:3  Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light
 arise?

JOB 25:4  How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that
 is born of a woman?

JOB 25:5  Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not
 pure in his sight.

JOB 25:6  How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a
 worm?

JOB 26:1  But Job answered and said,

JOB 26:2  How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the
 arm that hath no strength?

JOB 26:3  How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou
 plentifully declared the thing as it is?

JOB 26:4  To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?

JOB 26:5  Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants
 thereof.

JOB 26:6  Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

JOB 26:7  He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the
 earth upon nothing.

JOB 26:8  He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not
 rent under them.

JOB 26:9  He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon
 it.

JOB 26:10  He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night
 come to an end.

JOB 26:11  The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.

JOB 26:12  He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he
 smiteth through the proud.

JOB 26:13  By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed
 the crooked serpent.

JOB 26:14  Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard
 of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

JOB 27:1  Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

JOB 27:2  As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who
 hath vexed my soul;

JOB 27:3  All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my
 nostrils;

JOB 27:4  My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.

JOB 27:5  God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove
 mine integrity from me.

JOB 27:6  My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall
 not reproach me so long as I live.

JOB 27:7  Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as
 the unrighteous.

JOB 27:8  For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when
 God taketh away his soul?

JOB 27:9  Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?

JOB 27:10  Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon
 God?

JOB 27:11  I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty
 will I not conceal.

JOB 27:12  Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
 altogether vain?

JOB 27:13  This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of
 oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.

JOB 27:14  If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his
 offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

JOB 27:15  Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows
 shall not weep.

JOB 27:16  Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the
 clay;

JOB 27:17  He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent
 shall divide the silver.

JOB 27:18  He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper
 maketh.

JOB 27:19  The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he
 openeth his eyes, and he is not.

JOB 27:20  Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away
 in the night.

JOB 27:21  The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm
 hurleth him out of his place.

JOB 27:22  For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out
 of his hand.

JOB 27:23  Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his
 place.

JOB 28:1  Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where
 they fine it.

JOB 28:2  Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.

JOB 28:3  He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the
 stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.

JOB 28:4  The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten
 of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.

JOB 28:5  As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up
 as it were fire.

JOB 28:6  The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of
 gold.

JOB 28:7  There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye
 hath not seen:

JOB 28:8  The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by
 it.

JOB 28:9  He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains
 by the roots.

JOB 28:10  He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every
 precious thing.

JOB 28:11  He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid
 bringeth he forth to light.

JOB 28:12  But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of
 understanding?

JOB 28:13  Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land
 of the living.

JOB 28:14  The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with
 me.

JOB 28:15  It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for
 the price thereof.

JOB 28:16  It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx,
 or the sapphire.

JOB 28:17  The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it
 shall not be for jewels of fine gold.

JOB 28:18  No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of
 wisdom is above rubies.

JOB 28:19  The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued
 with pure gold.

JOB 28:20  Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?

JOB 28:21  Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from
 the fowls of the air.

JOB 28:22  Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our
 ears.

JOB 28:23  God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.

JOB 28:24  For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole
 heaven;

JOB 28:25  To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by
 measure.

JOB 28:26  When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning
 of the thunder:

JOB 28:27  Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and
 searched it out.

JOB 28:28  And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom;
 and to depart from evil is understanding.

JOB 29:1  Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

JOB 29:2  Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved
 me;

JOB 29:3  When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked
 through darkness;

JOB 29:4  As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my
 tabernacle;

JOB 29:5  When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;

JOB 29:6  When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers
 of oil;

JOB 29:7  When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat
 in the street!

JOB 29:8  The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and
 stood up.

JOB 29:9  The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.

JOB 29:10  The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof
 of their mouth.

JOB 29:11  When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me,
 it gave witness to me:

JOB 29:12  Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him
 that had none to help him.

JOB 29:13  The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I
 caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

JOB 29:14  I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe
 and a diadem.

JOB 29:15  I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.

JOB 29:16  I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I
 searched out.

JOB 29:17  And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his
 teeth.

JOB 29:18  Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as
 the sand.

JOB 29:19  My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon
 my branch.

JOB 29:20  My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

JOB 29:21  Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.

JOB 29:22  After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon
 them.

JOB 29:23  And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth
 wide as for the latter rain.

JOB 29:24  If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my
 countenance they cast not down.

JOB 29:25  I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the
 army, as one that comforteth the mourners.

JOB 30:1  But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose
 fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.

JOB 30:2  Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old
 age was perished?

JOB 30:3  For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness
 in former time desolate and waste.

JOB 30:4  Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.

JOB 30:5  They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as
 after a thief;)

JOB 30:6  To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and
 in the rocks.

JOB 30:7  Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered
 together.

JOB 30:8  They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were
 viler than the earth.

JOB 30:9  And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.

JOB 30:10  They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my
 face.

JOB 30:11  Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let
 loose the bridle before me.

JOB 30:12  Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they
 raise up against me the ways of their destruction.

JOB 30:13  They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.

JOB 30:14  They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation
 they rolled themselves upon me.

JOB 30:15  Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my
 welfare passeth away as a cloud.

JOB 30:16  And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have
 taken hold upon me.

JOB 30:17  My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take
 no rest.

JOB 30:18  By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth
 me about as the collar of my coat.

JOB 30:19  He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.

JOB 30:20  I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou
 regardest me not.

JOB 30:21  Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest
 thyself against me.

JOB 30:22  Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and
 dissolvest my substance.

JOB 30:23  For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house
 appointed for all living.

JOB 30:24  Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they
 cry in his destruction.

JOB 30:25  Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved
 for the poor?

JOB 30:26  When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited
 for light, there came darkness.

JOB 30:27  My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented
 me.

JOB 30:28  I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the
 congregation.

JOB 30:29  I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

JOB 30:30  My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

JOB 30:31  My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice
 of them that weep.

JOB 31:1  I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a
 maid?

JOB 31:2  For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance
 of the Almighty from on high?

JOB 31:3  Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the
 workers of iniquity?

JOB 31:4  Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

JOB 31:5  If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;

JOB 31:6  Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine
 integrity.

JOB 31:7  If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after
 mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;

JOB 31:8  Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted
 out.

JOB 31:9  If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait
 at my neighbour's door;

JOB 31:10  Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon
 her.

JOB 31:11  For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished
 by the judges.

JOB 31:12  For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out
 all mine increase.

JOB 31:13  If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant,
 when they contended with me;

JOB 31:14  What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what
 shall I answer him?

JOB 31:15  Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
 fashion us in the womb?

JOB 31:16  If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the
 eyes of the widow to fail;

JOB 31:17  Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not
 eaten thereof;

JOB 31:18  (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and
 I have guided her from my mother's womb;)

JOB 31:19  If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without
 covering;

JOB 31:20  If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the
 fleece of my sheep;

JOB 31:21  If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my
 help in the gate:

JOB 31:22  Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be
 broken from the bone.

JOB 31:23  For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his
 highness I could not endure.

JOB 31:24  If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art
 my confidence;

JOB 31:25  If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had
 gotten much;

JOB 31:26  If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in
 brightness;

JOB 31:27  And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my
 hand:

JOB 31:28  This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should
 have denied the God that is above.

JOB 31:29  If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up
 myself when evil found him:

JOB 31:30  Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his
 soul.

JOB 31:31  If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh!
 we cannot be satisfied.

JOB 31:32  The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors
 to the traveller.

JOB 31:33  If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in
 my bosom:

JOB 31:34  Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families
 terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?

JOB 31:35  Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty
 would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.

JOB 31:36  Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to
 me.

JOB 31:37  I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I
 go near unto him.

JOB 31:38  If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof
 complain;

JOB 31:39  If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the
 owners thereof to lose their life:

JOB 31:40  Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.
 The words of Job are ended.

JOB 32:1  So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in
 his own eyes.

JOB 32:2  Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite,
 of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he
 justified himself rather than God.

JOB 32:3  Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they
 had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

JOB 32:4  Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder
 than he.

JOB 32:5  When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three
 men, then his wrath was kindled.

JOB 32:6  And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am
 young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you
 mine opinion.

JOB 32:7  I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach
 wisdom.

JOB 32:8  But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty
 giveth them understanding.

JOB 32:9  Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand
 judgment.

JOB 32:10  Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.

JOB 32:11  Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst
 ye searched out what to say.

JOB 32:12  Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that
 convinced Job, or that answered his words:

JOB 32:13  Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him
 down, not man.

JOB 32:14  Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer
 him with your speeches.

JOB 32:15  They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.

JOB 32:16  When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and
 answered no more;)

JOB 32:17  I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.

JOB 32:18  For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

JOB 32:19  Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst
 like new bottles.

JOB 32:20  I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and
 answer.

JOB 32:21  Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give
 flattering titles unto man.

JOB 32:22  For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would
 soon take me away.

JOB 33:1  Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my
 words.

JOB 33:2  Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my
 mouth.

JOB 33:3  My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall
 utter knowledge clearly.

JOB 33:4  The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath
 given me life.

JOB 33:5  If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.

JOB 33:6  Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed
 out of the clay.

JOB 33:7  Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand
 be heavy upon thee.

JOB 33:8  Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice
 of thy words, saying,

JOB 33:9  I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there
 iniquity in me.

JOB 33:10  Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his
 enemy,

JOB 33:11  He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.

JOB 33:12  Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is
 greater than man.

JOB 33:13  Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any
 of his matters.

JOB 33:14  For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.

JOB 33:15  In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon
 men, in slumberings upon the bed;

JOB 33:16  Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,

JOB 33:17  That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.

JOB 33:18  He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing
 by the sword.

JOB 33:19  He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of
 his bones with strong pain:

JOB 33:20  So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.

JOB 33:21  His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones
 that were not seen stick out.

JOB 33:22  Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
 destroyers.

JOB 33:23  If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
 thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:

JOB 33:24  Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down
 to the pit: I have found a ransom.

JOB 33:25  His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the
 days of his youth:

JOB 33:26  He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he
 shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.

JOB 33:27  He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted
 that which was right, and it profited me not;

JOB 33:28  He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall
 see the light.

JOB 33:29  Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,

JOB 33:30  To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the
 light of the living.

JOB 33:31  Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.

JOB 33:32  If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to
 justify thee.

JOB 33:33  If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee
 wisdom.

JOB 34:1  Furthermore Elihu answered and said,

JOB 34:2  Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have
 knowledge.

JOB 34:3  For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.

JOB 34:4  Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is
 good.

JOB 34:5  For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my
 judgment.

JOB 34:6  Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without
 transgression.

JOB 34:7  What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?

JOB 34:8  Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with
 wicked men.

JOB 34:9  For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight
 himself with God.

JOB 34:10  Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from
 God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should
 commit iniquity.

JOB 34:11  For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man
 to find according to his ways.

JOB 34:12  Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty
 pervert judgment.

JOB 34:13  Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the
 whole world?

JOB 34:14  If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit
 and his breath;

JOB 34:15  All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.

JOB 34:16  If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of
 my words.

JOB 34:17  Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him
 that is most just?

JOB 34:18  Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are
 ungodly?

JOB 34:19  How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor
 regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his
 hands.

JOB 34:20  In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at
 midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.

JOB 34:21  For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.

JOB 34:22  There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of
 iniquity may hide themselves.

JOB 34:23  For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter
 into judgment with God.

JOB 34:24  He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others
 in their stead.

JOB 34:25  Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the
 night, so that they are destroyed.

JOB 34:26  He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;

JOB 34:27  Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his
 ways:

JOB 34:28  So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he
 heareth the cry of the afflicted.

JOB 34:29  When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he
 hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a
 nation, or against a man only:

JOB 34:30  That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.

JOB 34:31  Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I
 will not offend any more:

JOB 34:32  That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will
 do no more.

JOB 34:33  Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether
 thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou
 knowest.

JOB 34:34  Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto
 me.

JOB 34:35  Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without
 wisdom.

JOB 34:36  My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
 answers for wicked men.

JOB 34:37  For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among
 us, and multiplieth his words against God.

JOB 35:1  Elihu spake moreover, and said,

JOB 35:2  Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is
 more than God's?

JOB 35:3  For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What
 profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?

JOB 35:4  I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.

JOB 35:5  Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are
 higher than thou.

JOB 35:6  If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy
 transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?

JOB 35:7  If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of
 thine hand?

JOB 35:8  Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may
 profit the son of man.

JOB 35:9  By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to
 cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.

JOB 35:10  But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the
 night;

JOB 35:11  Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us
 wiser than the fowls of heaven?

JOB 35:12  There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil
 men.

JOB 35:13  Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard
 it.

JOB 35:14  Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before
 him; therefore trust thou in him.

JOB 35:15  But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he
 knoweth it not in great extremity:

JOB 35:16  Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words
 without knowledge.

JOB 36:1  Elihu also proceeded, and said,

JOB 36:2  Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on
 God's behalf.

JOB 36:3  I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness
 to my Maker.

JOB 36:4  For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in
 knowledge is with thee.

JOB 36:5  Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in
 strength and wisdom.

JOB 36:6  He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the
 poor.

JOB 36:7  He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are
 they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are
 exalted.

JOB 36:8  And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of
 affliction;

JOB 36:9  Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they
 have exceeded.

JOB 36:10  He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they
 return from iniquity.

JOB 36:11  If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in
 prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

JOB 36:12  But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall
 die without knowledge.

JOB 36:13  But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he
 bindeth them.

JOB 36:14  They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.

JOB 36:15  He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in
 oppression.

JOB 36:16  Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad
 place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy
 table should be full of fatness.

JOB 36:17  But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and
 justice take hold on thee.

JOB 36:18  Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
 stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

JOB 36:19  Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
 strength.

JOB 36:20  Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

JOB 36:21  Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather
 than affliction.

JOB 36:22  Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?

JOB 36:23  Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought
 iniquity?

JOB 36:24  Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.

JOB 36:25  Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.

JOB 36:26  Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of
 his years be searched out.

JOB 36:27  For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain
 according to the vapour thereof:

JOB 36:28  Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.

JOB 36:29  Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise
 of his tabernacle?

JOB 36:30  Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom
 of the sea.

JOB 36:31  For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.

JOB 36:32  With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by
 the cloud that cometh betwixt.

JOB 36:33  The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning
 the vapour.

JOB 37:1  At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.

JOB 37:2  Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out
 of his mouth.

JOB 37:3  He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the
 ends of the earth.

JOB 37:4  After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
 excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.

JOB 37:5  God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he,
 which we cannot comprehend.

JOB 37:6  For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small
 rain, and to the great rain of his strength.

JOB 37:7  He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.

JOB 37:8  Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.

JOB 37:9  Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.

JOB 37:10  By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters
 is straitened.

JOB 37:11  Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his
 bright cloud:

JOB 37:12  And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do
 whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.

JOB 37:13  He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or
 for mercy.

JOB 37:14  Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous
 works of God.

JOB 37:15  Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his
 cloud to shine?

JOB 37:16  Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of
 him which is perfect in knowledge?

JOB 37:17  How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south
 wind?

JOB 37:18  Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a
 molten looking glass?

JOB 37:19  Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech
 by reason of darkness.

JOB 37:20  Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall
 be swallowed up.

JOB 37:21  And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the
 wind passeth, and cleanseth them.

JOB 37:22  Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.

JOB 37:23  Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in
 power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.

JOB 37:24  Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of
 heart.

JOB 38:1  Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

JOB 38:2  Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

JOB 38:3  Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and
 answer thou me.

JOB 38:4  Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if
 thou hast understanding.

JOB 38:5  Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath
 stretched the line upon it?

JOB 38:6  Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the
 corner stone thereof;

JOB 38:7  When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted
 for joy?

JOB 38:8  Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had
 issued out of the womb?

JOB 38:9  When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a
 swaddlingband for it,

JOB 38:10  And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,

JOB 38:11  And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall
 thy proud waves be stayed?

JOB 38:12  Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the
 dayspring to know his place;

JOB 38:13  That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked
 might be shaken out of it?

JOB 38:14  It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.

JOB 38:15  And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm
 shall be broken.

JOB 38:16  Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked
 in the search of the depth?

JOB 38:17  Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the
 doors of the shadow of death?

JOB 38:18  Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou
 knowest it all.

JOB 38:19  Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is
 the place thereof,

JOB 38:20  That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou
 shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?

JOB 38:21  Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number
 of thy days is great?

JOB 38:22  Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen
 the treasures of the hail,

JOB 38:23  Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day
 of battle and war?

JOB 38:24  By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon
 the earth?

JOB 38:25  Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a
 way for the lightning of thunder;

JOB 38:26  To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the
 wilderness, wherein there is no man;

JOB 38:27  To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud
 of the tender herb to spring forth?

JOB 38:28  Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

JOB 38:29  Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who
 hath gendered it?

JOB 38:30  The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is
 frozen.

JOB 38:31  Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands
 of Orion?

JOB 38:32  Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide
 Arcturus with his sons?

JOB 38:33  Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion
 thereof in the earth?

JOB 38:34  Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters
 may cover thee?

JOB 38:35  Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here
 we are?

JOB 38:36  Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given
 understanding to the heart?

JOB 38:37  Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of
 heaven,

JOB 38:38  When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast
 together?

JOB 38:39  Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the
 young lions,

JOB 38:40  When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in
 wait?

JOB 38:41  Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto
 God, they wander for lack of meat.

JOB 39:1  Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or
 canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

JOB 39:2  Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the
 time when they bring forth?

JOB 39:3  They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out
 their sorrows.

JOB 39:4  Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go
 forth, and return not unto them.

JOB 39:5  Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands
 of the wild ass?

JOB 39:6  Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his
 dwellings.

JOB 39:7  He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the
 crying of the driver.

JOB 39:8  The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after
 every green thing.

JOB 39:9  Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?

JOB 39:10  Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he
 harrow the valleys after thee?

JOB 39:11  Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou
 leave thy labour to him?

JOB 39:12  Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather
 it into thy barn?

JOB 39:13  Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and
 feathers unto the ostrich?

JOB 39:14  Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,

JOB 39:15  And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast
 may break them.

JOB 39:16  She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not
 her's: her labour is in vain without fear;

JOB 39:17  Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to
 her understanding.

JOB 39:18  What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and
 his rider.

JOB 39:19  Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with
 thunder?

JOB 39:20  Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his
 nostrils is terrible.

JOB 39:21  He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on
 to meet the armed men.

JOB 39:22  He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back
 from the sword.

JOB 39:23  The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
 shield.

JOB 39:24  He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth
 he that it is the sound of the trumpet.

JOB 39:25  He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar
 off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.

JOB 39:26  Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the
 south?

JOB 39:27  Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?

JOB 39:28  She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and
 the strong place.

JOB 39:29  From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.

JOB 39:30  Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is
 she.

JOB 40:1  Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,

JOB 40:2  Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that
 reproveth God, let him answer it.

JOB 40:3  Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

JOB 40:4  Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand
 upon my mouth.

JOB 40:5  Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will
 proceed no further.

JOB 40:6  Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

JOB 40:7  Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare
 thou unto me.

JOB 40:8  Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou
 mayest be righteous?

JOB 40:9  Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like
 him?

JOB 40:10  Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with
 glory and beauty.

JOB 40:11  Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is
 proud, and abase him.

JOB 40:12  Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down
 the wicked in their place.

JOB 40:13  Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.

JOB 40:14  Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can
 save thee.

JOB 40:15  Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an
 ox.

JOB 40:16  Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel
 of his belly.

JOB 40:17  He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are
 wrapped together.

JOB 40:18  His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of
 iron.

JOB 40:19  He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his
 sword to approach unto him.

JOB 40:20  Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts
 of the field play.

JOB 40:21  He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.

JOB 40:22  The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the
 brook compass him about.

JOB 40:23  Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he
 can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

JOB 40:24  He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.

JOB 41:1  Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord
 which thou lettest down?

JOB 41:2  Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a
 thorn?

JOB 41:3  Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words
 unto thee?

JOB 41:4  Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant
 for ever?

JOB 41:5  Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy
 maidens?

JOB 41:6  Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among
 the merchants?

JOB 41:7  Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish
 spears?

JOB 41:8  Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

JOB 41:9  Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even
 at the sight of him?

JOB 41:10  None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand
 before me?

JOB 41:11  Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under
 the whole heaven is mine.

JOB 41:12  I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
 proportion.

JOB 41:13  Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him
 with his double bridle?

JOB 41:14  Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round
 about.

JOB 41:15  His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.

JOB 41:16  One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

JOB 41:17  They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they
 cannot be sundered.

JOB 41:18  By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the
 eyelids of the morning.

JOB 41:19  Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.

JOB 41:20  Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or
 caldron.

JOB 41:21  His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

JOB 41:22  In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before
 him.

JOB 41:23  The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm
 in themselves; they cannot be moved.

JOB 41:24  His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the
 nether millstone.

JOB 41:25  When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of
 breakings they purify themselves.

JOB 41:26  The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the
 dart, nor the habergeon.

JOB 41:27  He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

JOB 41:28  The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into
 stubble.

JOB 41:29  Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.

JOB 41:30  Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon
 the mire.

JOB 41:31  He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot
 of ointment.

JOB 41:32  He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be
 hoary.

JOB 41:33  Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

JOB 41:34  He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of
 pride.

JOB 42:1  Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

JOB 42:2  I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be
 withholden from thee.

JOB 42:3  Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I
 uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.

JOB 42:4  Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and
 declare thou unto me.

JOB 42:5  I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye
 seeth thee.

JOB 42:6  Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.

JOB 42:7  And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
 Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against
 thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing
 that is right, as my servant Job hath.

JOB 42:8  Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to
 my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant
 Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after
 your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like
 my servant Job.

JOB 42:9  So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
 Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also
 accepted Job.

JOB 42:10  And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
 friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.

JOB 42:11  Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and
 all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him
 in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that
 the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and
 every one an earring of gold.

JOB 42:12  So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning:
 for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand
 yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.

JOB 42:13  He had also seven sons and three daughters.

JOB 42:14  And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the
 second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.

JOB 42:15  And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of
 Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.

JOB 42:16  After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons,
 and his sons' sons, even four generations.

JOB 42:17  So Job died, being old and full of days.

PRO 1:1  The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

PRO 1:2  To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of
 understanding;

PRO 1:3  To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and
 equity;

PRO 1:4  To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
 discretion.

PRO 1:5  A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
 understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:

PRO 1:6  To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the
 wise, and their dark sayings.

PRO 1:7  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise
 wisdom and instruction.

PRO 1:8  My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of
 thy mother:

PRO 1:9  For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about
 thy neck.

PRO 1:10  My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

PRO 1:11  If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk
 privily for the innocent without cause:

PRO 1:12  Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that
 go down into the pit:

PRO 1:13  We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with
 spoil:

PRO 1:14  Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:

PRO 1:15  My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from
 their path:

PRO 1:16  For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

PRO 1:17  Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

PRO 1:18  And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their
 own lives.

PRO 1:19  So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh
 away the life of the owners thereof.

PRO 1:20  Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:

PRO 1:21  She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the
 gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,

PRO 1:22  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners
 delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

PRO 1:23  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I
 will make known my words unto you.

PRO 1:24  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
 hand, and no man regarded;

PRO 1:25  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
 reproof:

PRO 1:26  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear
 cometh;

PRO 1:27  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a
 whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.

PRO 1:28  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek
 me early, but they shall not find me:

PRO 1:29  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the
 LORD:

PRO 1:30  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.

PRO 1:31  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled
 with their own devices.

PRO 1:32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
 prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

PRO 1:33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet
 from fear of evil.

PRO 2:1  My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with
 thee;

PRO 2:2  So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to
 understanding;

PRO 2:3  Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for
 understanding;

PRO 2:4  If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid
 treasures;

PRO 2:5  Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the
 knowledge of God.

PRO 2:6  For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
 understanding.

PRO 2:7  He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them
 that walk uprightly.

PRO 2:8  He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his
 saints.

PRO 2:9  Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity;
 yea, every good path.

PRO 2:10  When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto
 thy soul;

PRO 2:11  Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:

PRO 2:12  To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that
 speaketh froward things;

PRO 2:13  Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;

PRO 2:14  Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;

PRO 2:15  Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:

PRO 2:16  To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which
 flattereth with her words;

PRO 2:17  Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant
 of her God.

PRO 2:18  For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.

PRO 2:19  None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the
 paths of life.

PRO 2:20  That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths
 of the righteous.

PRO 2:21  For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain
 in it.

PRO 2:22  But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors
 shall be rooted out of it.

PRO 3:1  My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:

PRO 3:2  For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.

PRO 3:3  Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write
 them upon the table of thine heart:

PRO 3:4  So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God
 and man.

PRO 3:5  Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
 understanding.

PRO 3:6  In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

PRO 3:7  Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.

PRO 3:8  It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

PRO 3:9  Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all
 thine increase:

PRO 3:10  So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst
 out with new wine.

PRO 3:11  My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of
 his correction:

PRO 3:12  For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in
 whom he delighteth.

PRO 3:13  Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
 understanding.

PRO 3:14  For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
 silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

PRO 3:15  She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst
 desire are not to be compared unto her.

PRO 3:16  Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and
 honour.

PRO 3:17  Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

PRO 3:18  She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is
 every one that retaineth her.

PRO 3:19  The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he
 established the heavens.

PRO 3:20  By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down
 the dew.

PRO 3:21  My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and
 discretion:

PRO 3:22  So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

PRO 3:23  Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
 stumble.

PRO 3:24  When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie
 down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

PRO 3:25  Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
 wicked, when it cometh.

PRO 3:26  For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from
 being taken.

PRO 3:27  Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the
 power of thine hand to do it.

PRO 3:28  Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will
 give; when thou hast it by thee.

PRO 3:29  Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by
 thee.

PRO 3:30  Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.

PRO 3:31  Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

PRO 3:32  For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with
 the righteous.

PRO 3:33  The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth
 the habitation of the just.

PRO 3:34  Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.

PRO 3:35  The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of
 fools.

PRO 4:1  Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know
 understanding.

PRO 4:2  For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

PRO 4:3  For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my
 mother.

PRO 4:4  He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words:
 keep my commandments, and live.

PRO 4:5  Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the
 words of my mouth.

PRO 4:6  Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall
 keep thee.

PRO 4:7  Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy
 getting get understanding.

PRO 4:8  Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour,
 when thou dost embrace her.

PRO 4:9  She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory
 shall she deliver to thee.

PRO 4:10  Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life
 shall be many.

PRO 4:11  I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right
 paths.

PRO 4:12  When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou
 runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

PRO 4:13  Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is
 thy life.

PRO 4:14  Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil
 men.

PRO 4:15  Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

PRO 4:16  For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep
 is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

PRO 4:17  For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.

PRO 4:18  But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more
 and more unto the perfect day.

PRO 4:19  The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they
 stumble.

PRO 4:20  My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

PRO 4:21  Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine
 heart.

PRO 4:22  For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their
 flesh.

PRO 4:23  Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of
 life.

PRO 4:24  Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from
 thee.

PRO 4:25  Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight
 before thee.

PRO 4:26  Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.

PRO 4:27  Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from
 evil.

PRO 5:1  My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:

PRO 5:2  That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep
 knowledge.

PRO 5:3  For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is
 smoother than oil:

PRO 5:4  But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

PRO 5:5  Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

PRO 5:6  Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable,
 that thou canst not know them.

PRO 5:7  Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of
 my mouth.

PRO 5:8  Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:

PRO 5:9  Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:

PRO 5:10  Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the
 house of a stranger;

PRO 5:11  And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,

PRO 5:12  And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;

PRO 5:13  And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear
 to them that instructed me!

PRO 5:14  I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and
 assembly.

PRO 5:15  Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of
 thine own well.

PRO 5:16  Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the
 streets.

PRO 5:17  Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

PRO 5:18  Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.

PRO 5:19  Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts
 satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.

PRO 5:20  And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and
 embrace the bosom of a stranger?

PRO 5:21  For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth
 all his goings.

PRO 5:22  His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be
 holden with the cords of his sins.

PRO 5:23  He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly
 he shall go astray.

PRO 6:1  My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy
 hand with a stranger,

PRO 6:2  Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the
 words of thy mouth.

PRO 6:3  Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the
 hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.

PRO 6:4  Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

PRO 6:5  Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird
 from the hand of the fowler.

PRO 6:6  Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

PRO 6:7  Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

PRO 6:8  Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the
 harvest.

PRO 6:9  How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy
 sleep?

PRO 6:10  Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands
 to sleep:

PRO 6:11  So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an
 armed man.

PRO 6:12  A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

PRO 6:13  He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with
 his fingers;

PRO 6:14  Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he
 soweth discord.

PRO 6:15  Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be
 broken without remedy.

PRO 6:16  These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination
 unto him:

PRO 6:17  A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,

PRO 6:18  An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in
 running to mischief,

PRO 6:19  A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among
 brethren.

PRO 6:20  My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy
 mother:

PRO 6:21  Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.

PRO 6:22  When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall
 keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

PRO 6:23  For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of
 instruction are the way of life:

PRO 6:24  To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of
 a strange woman.

PRO 6:25  Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee
 with her eyelids.

PRO 6:26  For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread:
 and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.

PRO 6:27  Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

PRO 6:28  Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

PRO 6:29  So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her
 shall not be innocent.

PRO 6:30  Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he
 is hungry;

PRO 6:31  But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the
 substance of his house.

PRO 6:32  But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he
 that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

PRO 6:33  A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be
 wiped away.

PRO 6:34  For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the
 day of vengeance.

PRO 6:35  He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though
 thou givest many gifts.

PRO 7:1  My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

PRO 7:2  Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.

PRO 7:3  Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.

PRO 7:4  Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy
 kinswoman:

PRO 7:5  That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger
 which flattereth with her words.

PRO 7:6  For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

PRO 7:7  And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a
 young man void of understanding,

PRO 7:8  Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her
 house,

PRO 7:9  In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

PRO 7:10  And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and
 subtil of heart.

PRO 7:11  (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

PRO 7:12  Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every
 corner.)

PRO 7:13  So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said
 unto him,

PRO 7:14  I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

PRO 7:15  Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and
 I have found thee.

PRO 7:16  I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works,
 with fine linen of Egypt.

PRO 7:17  I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

PRO 7:18  Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace
 ourselves with loves.

PRO 7:19  For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:

PRO 7:20  He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day
 appointed.

PRO 7:21  With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
 flattering of her lips she forced him.

PRO 7:22  He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or
 as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

PRO 7:23  Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the
 snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.

PRO 7:24  Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words
 of my mouth.

PRO 7:25  Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.

PRO 7:26  For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been
 slain by her.

PRO 7:27  Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.

PRO 8:1  Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

PRO 8:2  She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places
 of the paths.

PRO 8:3  She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at
 the doors.

PRO 8:4  Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.

PRO 8:5  O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an
 understanding heart.

PRO 8:6  Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips
 shall be right things.

PRO 8:7  For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my
 lips.

PRO 8:8  All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing
 froward or perverse in them.

PRO 8:9  They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that
 find knowledge.

PRO 8:10  Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than
 choice gold.

PRO 8:11  For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be
 desired are not to be compared to it.

PRO 8:12  I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty
 inventions.

PRO 8:13  The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the
 evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

PRO 8:14  Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have
 strength.

PRO 8:15  By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

PRO 8:16  By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.

PRO 8:17  I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.

PRO 8:18  Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.

PRO 8:19  My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue
 than choice silver.

PRO 8:20  I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of
 judgment:

PRO 8:21  That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will
 fill their treasures.

PRO 8:22  The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works
 of old.

PRO 8:23  I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth
 was.

PRO 8:24  When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no
 fountains abounding with water.

PRO 8:25  Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought
 forth:

PRO 8:26  While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the
 highest part of the dust of the world.

PRO 8:27  When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon
 the face of the depth:

PRO 8:28  When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the
 fountains of the deep:

PRO 8:29  When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass
 his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:

PRO 8:30  Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his
 delight, rejoicing always before him;

PRO 8:31  Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were
 with the sons of men.

PRO 8:32  Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they
 that keep my ways.

PRO 8:33  Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

PRO 8:34  Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates,
 waiting at the posts of my doors.

PRO 8:35  For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the
 LORD.

PRO 8:36  But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that
 hate me love death.

PRO 9:1  Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:

PRO 9:2  She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also
 furnished her table.

PRO 9:3  She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places
 of the city,

PRO 9:4  Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth
 understanding, she saith to him,

PRO 9:5  Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.

PRO 9:6  Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.

PRO 9:7  He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that
 rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.

PRO 9:8  Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he
 will love thee.

PRO 9:9  Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just
 man, and he will increase in learning.

PRO 9:10  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge
 of the holy is understanding.

PRO 9:11  For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life
 shall be increased.

PRO 9:12  If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou
 scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.

PRO 9:13  A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.

PRO 9:14  For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high
 places of the city,

PRO 9:15  To call passengers who go right on their ways:

PRO 9:16  Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth
 understanding, she saith to him,

PRO 9:17  Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.

PRO 9:18  But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are
 in the depths of hell.

PRO 10:1  The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a
 foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

PRO 10:2  Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth
 from death.

PRO 10:3  The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he
 casteth away the substance of the wicked.

PRO 10:4  He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the
 diligent maketh rich.

PRO 10:5  He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in
 harvest is a son that causeth shame.

PRO 10:6  Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the
 mouth of the wicked.

PRO 10:7  The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall
 rot.

PRO 10:8  The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall
 fall.

PRO 10:9  He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his
 ways shall be known.

PRO 10:10  He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool
 shall fall.

PRO 10:11  The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence
 covereth the mouth of the wicked.

PRO 10:12  Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.

PRO 10:13  In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a
 rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.

PRO 10:14  Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near
 destruction.

PRO 10:15  The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the
 poor is their poverty.

PRO 10:16  The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked
 to sin.

PRO 10:17  He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
 refuseth reproof erreth.

PRO 10:18  He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a
 slander, is a fool.

PRO 10:19  In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that
 refraineth his lips is wise.

PRO 10:20  The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked
 is little worth.

PRO 10:21  The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of
 wisdom.

PRO 10:22  The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow
 with it.

PRO 10:23  It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding
 hath wisdom.

PRO 10:24  The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire
 of the righteous shall be granted.

PRO 10:25  As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the
 righteous is an everlasting foundation.

PRO 10:26  As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the
 sluggard to them that send him.

PRO 10:27  The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked
 shall be shortened.

PRO 10:28  The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation
 of the wicked shall perish.

PRO 10:29  The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction
 shall be to the workers of iniquity.

PRO 10:30  The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not
 inhabit the earth.

PRO 10:31  The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue
 shall be cut out.

PRO 10:32  The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth
 of the wicked speaketh frowardness.

PRO 11:1  A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his
 delight.

PRO 11:2  When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.

PRO 11:3  The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness
 of transgressors shall destroy them.

PRO 11:4  Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth
 from death.

PRO 11:5  The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked
 shall fall by his own wickedness.

PRO 11:6  The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but
 transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.

PRO 11:7  When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope
 of unjust men perisheth.

PRO 11:8  The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in
 his stead.

PRO 11:9  An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through
 knowledge shall the just be delivered.

PRO 11:10  When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when
 the wicked perish, there is shouting.

PRO 11:11  By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is
 overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

PRO 11:12  He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of
 understanding holdeth his peace.

PRO 11:13  A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit
 concealeth the matter.

PRO 11:14  Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of
 counsellors there is safety.

PRO 11:15  He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that
 hateth suretiship is sure.

PRO 11:16  A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.

PRO 11:17  The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel
 troubleth his own flesh.

PRO 11:18  The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth
 righteousness shall be a sure reward.

PRO 11:19  As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth
 it to his own death.

PRO 11:20  They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD: but
 such as are upright in their way are his delight.

PRO 11:21  Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but
 the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

PRO 11:22  As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is
 without discretion.

PRO 11:23  The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the
 wicked is wrath.

PRO 11:24  There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that
 withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.

PRO 11:25  The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be
 watered also himself.

PRO 11:26  He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing
 shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.

PRO 11:27  He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that
 seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

PRO 11:28  He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall
 flourish as a branch.

PRO 11:29  He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool
 shall be servant to the wise of heart.

PRO 11:30  The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth
 souls is wise.

PRO 11:31  Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more
 the wicked and the sinner.

PRO 12:1  Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof
 is brutish.

PRO 12:2  A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices
 will he condemn.

PRO 12:3  A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the
 righteous shall not be moved.

PRO 12:4  A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh
 ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.

PRO 12:5  The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the
 wicked are deceit.

PRO 12:6  The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth
 of the upright shall deliver them.

PRO 12:7  The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the
 righteous shall stand.

PRO 12:8  A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a
 perverse heart shall be despised.

PRO 12:9  He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that
 honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

PRO 12:10  A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender
 mercies of the wicked are cruel.

PRO 12:11  He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that
 followeth vain persons is void of understanding.

 righteous yieldeth fruit.

PRO 12:13  The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just
 shall come out of trouble.

PRO 12:14  A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and
 the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.

PRO 12:15  The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth
 unto counsel is wise.

PRO 12:16  A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.

PRO 12:17  He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false
 witness deceit.

PRO 12:18  There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue
 of the wise is health.

PRO 12:19  The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue
 is but for a moment.

 counsellors of peace is joy.

 filled with mischief.

 his delight.

 proclaimeth foolishness.

 under tribute.

 maketh it glad.

PRO 12:26  The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way
 of the wicked seduceth them.

 substance of a diligent man is precious.

 there is no death.

PRO 13:1  A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth
 not rebuke.

PRO 13:2  A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the
 transgressors shall eat violence.

 his lips shall have destruction.

PRO 13:4  The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul
 of the diligent shall be made fat.

 cometh to shame.

 overthroweth the sinner.

 maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.

 rebuke.

 shall be put out.

 wisdom.

 by labour shall increase.

 is a tree of life.

 commandment shall be rewarded.

PRO 13:14  The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares
 of death.

 hard.

 folly.

PRO 13:17  A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador
 is health.

PRO 13:18  Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he
 that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.

PRO 13:19  The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination
 to fools to depart from evil.

PRO 13:20  He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of
 fools shall be destroyed.

PRO 13:21  Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.

PRO 13:22  A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and
 the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.

PRO 13:23  Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is
 destroyed for want of judgment.

PRO 13:24  He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him
 chasteneth him betimes.

 with her hands.

 perverse in his ways despiseth him.

 wise shall preserve them.

 strength of the ox.

PRO 14:5  A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.

PRO 14:6  A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy
 unto him that understandeth.

PRO 14:7  Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in
 him the lips of knowledge.

PRO 14:8  The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of
 fools is deceit.

 intermeddle with his joy.

 his going.

 rageth, and is confident.

 is hated.

 knowledge.

PRO 14:19  The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the
 righteous.

 friends.

PRO 14:21  He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on
 the poor, happy is he.

 to them that devise good.

 to penury.

 is folly.

 lies.

 have a place of refuge.

PRO 14:27  The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the
 snares of death.

PRO 14:28  In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of
 people is the destruction of the prince.

PRO 14:29  He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is
 hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

PRO 14:30  A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness
 of the bones.

 hope in his death.

 which is in the midst of fools is made known.

 people.

PRO 14:35  The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against
 him that causeth shame.

PRO 15:1  A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.

PRO 15:2  The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools
 poureth out foolishness.

PRO 15:3  The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the
 good.

PRO 15:4  A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a
 breach in the spirit.

PRO 15:5  A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth
 reproof is prudent.

PRO 15:6  In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues
 of the wicked is trouble.

 doeth not so.

 prayer of the upright is his delight.

 him that followeth after righteousness.

PRO 15:10  Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that
 hateth reproof shall die.

PRO 15:11  Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the
 hearts of the children of men?

PRO 15:12  A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto
 the wise.

PRO 15:13  A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the
 heart the spirit is broken.

 mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.

 heart hath a continual feast.

PRO 15:16  Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and
 trouble therewith.

PRO 15:17  Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and
 hatred therewith.

PRO 15:18  A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger
 appeaseth strife.

PRO 15:19  The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way
 of the righteous is made plain.

PRO 15:20  A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his
 mother.

PRO 15:21  Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of
 understanding walketh uprightly.

PRO 15:22  Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of
 counsellors they are established.

PRO 15:23  A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due
 season, how good is it!

PRO 15:24  The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell
 beneath.

PRO 15:25  The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish
 the border of the widow.

PRO 15:26  The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the
 words of the pure are pleasant words.

PRO 15:27  He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that
 hateth gifts shall live.

PRO 15:28  The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the
 wicked poureth out evil things.

PRO 15:29  The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the
 righteous.

PRO 15:30  The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh
 the bones fat.

PRO 15:31  The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.

PRO 15:32  He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that
 heareth reproof getteth understanding.

PRO 15:33  The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour
 is humility.

PRO 16:1  The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue,
 is from the LORD.

PRO 16:2  All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD
 weigheth the spirits.

PRO 16:3  Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be
 established.

PRO 16:4  The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for
 the day of evil.

PRO 16:5  Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD:
 though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

PRO 16:6  By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD
 men depart from evil.

PRO 16:7  When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be
 at peace with him.

PRO 16:8  Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without
 right.

PRO 16:9  A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.

PRO 16:10  A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth
 transgresseth not in judgment.

PRO 16:11  A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of the bag
 are his work.

PRO 16:12  It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne
 is established by righteousness.

PRO 16:13  Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that
 speaketh right.

PRO 16:14  The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will
 pacify it.

PRO 16:15  In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as
 a cloud of the latter rain.

PRO 16:16  How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get
 understanding rather to be chosen than silver!

PRO 16:17  The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth
 his way preserveth his soul.

PRO 16:18  Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.

PRO 16:19  Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
 divide the spoil with the proud.

PRO 16:20  He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth
 in the LORD, happy is he.

PRO 16:21  The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the
 lips increaseth learning.

PRO 16:22  Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the
 instruction of fools is folly.

PRO 16:23  The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his
 lips.

PRO 16:24  Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health
 to the bones.

PRO 16:25  There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof
 are the ways of death.

PRO 16:26  He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of
 him.

PRO 16:27  An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a
 burning fire.

PRO 16:28  A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief
 friends.

PRO 16:29  A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way
 that is not good.

PRO 16:30  He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he
 bringeth evil to pass.

PRO 16:31  The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of
 righteousness.

PRO 16:32  He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that
 ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

PRO 16:33  The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is
 of the LORD.

PRO 17:1  Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full
 of sacrifices with strife.

PRO 17:2  A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and
 shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.

PRO 17:3  The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD
 trieth the hearts.

PRO 17:4  A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a
 naughty tongue.

PRO 17:5  Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at
 calamities shall not be unpunished.

PRO 17:6  Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of
 children are their fathers.

PRO 17:7  Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a
 prince.

PRO 17:8  A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
 whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

PRO 17:9  He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth
 a matter separateth very friends.

PRO 17:10  A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into
 a fool.

PRO 17:11  An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger
 shall be sent against him.

PRO 17:12  Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in
 his folly.

PRO 17:13  Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.

PRO 17:14  The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore
 leave off contention, before it be meddled with.

PRO 17:15  He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even
 they both are abomination to the LORD.

PRO 17:16  Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom,
 seeing he hath no heart to it?

PRO 17:17  A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.

PRO 17:18  A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety
 in the presence of his friend.

PRO 17:19  He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his
 gate seeketh destruction.

PRO 17:20  He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a
 perverse tongue falleth into mischief.

PRO 17:21  He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a
 fool hath no joy.

PRO 17:22  A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth
 the bones.

PRO 17:23  A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of
 judgment.

PRO 17:24  Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool
 are in the ends of the earth.

PRO 17:25  A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that
 bare him.

PRO 17:26  Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for
 equity.

PRO 17:27  He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding
 is of an excellent spirit.

PRO 17:28  Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that
 shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

PRO 18:1  Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and
 intermeddleth with all wisdom.

PRO 18:2  A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may
 discover itself.

PRO 18:3  When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy
 reproach.

PRO 18:4  The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of
 wisdom as a flowing brook.

PRO 18:5  It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the
 righteous in judgment.

PRO 18:6  A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for
 strokes.

PRO 18:7  A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his
 soul.

PRO 18:8  The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the
 innermost parts of the belly.

PRO 18:9  He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a
 great waster.

PRO 18:10  The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into
 it, and is safe.

PRO 18:11  The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his
 own conceit.

PRO 18:12  Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is
 humility.

PRO 18:13  He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and
 shame unto him.

PRO 18:14  The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit
 who can bear?

PRO 18:15  The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise
 seeketh knowledge.

PRO 18:16  A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.

PRO 18:17  He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour
 cometh and searcheth him.

PRO 18:18  The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the
 mighty.

PRO 18:19  A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their
 contentions are like the bars of a castle.

PRO 18:20  A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and
 with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

PRO 18:21  Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it
 shall eat the fruit thereof.

PRO 18:22  Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour
 of the LORD.

PRO 18:23  The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.

PRO 18:24  A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a
 friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

PRO 19:1  Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is
 perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

PRO 19:2  Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that
 hasteth with his feet sinneth.

PRO 19:3  The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth
 against the LORD.

PRO 19:4  Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
 neighbour.

PRO 19:5  A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies
 shall not escape.

PRO 19:6  Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend
 to him that giveth gifts.

PRO 19:7  All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his
 friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to
 him.

PRO 19:8  He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth
 understanding shall find good.

PRO 19:9  A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies
 shall perish.

PRO 19:10  Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have
 rule over princes.

PRO 19:11  The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to
 pass over a transgression.

PRO 19:12  The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as
 dew upon the grass.

PRO 19:13  A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of
 a wife are a continual dropping.

PRO 19:14  House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife
 is from the LORD.

PRO 19:15  Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall
 suffer hunger.

PRO 19:16  He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that
 despiseth his ways shall die.

PRO 19:17  He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that
 which he hath given will he pay him again.

PRO 19:18  Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for
 his crying.

PRO 19:19  A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver
 him, yet thou must do it again.

PRO 19:20  Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in
 thy latter end.

PRO 19:21  There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel
 of the LORD, that shall stand.

PRO 19:22  The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a
 liar.

PRO 19:23  The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall
 abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.

PRO 19:24  A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as
 bring it to his mouth again.

PRO 19:25  Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that
 hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.

PRO 19:26  He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son
 that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

PRO 19:27  Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the
 words of knowledge.

PRO 19:28  An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked
 devoureth iniquity.

PRO 19:29  Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of
 fools.

PRO 20:1  Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived
 thereby is not wise.

PRO 20:2  The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him
 to anger sinneth against his own soul.

PRO 20:3  It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will
 be meddling.

PRO 20:4  The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he
 beg in harvest, and have nothing.

PRO 20:5  Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of
 understanding will draw it out.

PRO 20:6  Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man
 who can find?

PRO 20:7  The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after
 him.

PRO 20:8  A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all
 evil with his eyes.

PRO 20:9  Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?

PRO 20:10  Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike
 abomination to the LORD.

PRO 20:11  Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and
 whether it be right.

PRO 20:12  The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both
 of them.

PRO 20:13  Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou
 shalt be satisfied with bread.

PRO 20:14  It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his
 way, then he boasteth.

PRO 20:15  There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge
 are a precious jewel.

PRO 20:16  Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of
 him for a strange woman.

PRO 20:17  Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be
 filled with gravel.

PRO 20:18  Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make
 war.

PRO 20:19  He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore
 meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

PRO 20:20  Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in
 obscure darkness.

PRO 20:21  An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end
 thereof shall not be blessed.

PRO 20:22  Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he
 shall save thee.

PRO 20:23  Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance
 is not good.

PRO 20:24  Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own
 way?

PRO 20:25  It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after
 vows to make enquiry.

PRO 20:26  A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.

PRO 20:27  The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the
 inward parts of the belly.

PRO 20:28  Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by
 mercy.

PRO 20:29  The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men
 is the grey head.

PRO 20:30  The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the
 inward parts of the belly.

PRO 21:1  The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water:
 he turneth it whithersoever he will.

PRO 21:2  Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth
 the hearts.

PRO 21:3  To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than
 sacrifice.

PRO 21:4  An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is
 sin.

PRO 21:5  The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every
 one that is hasty only to want.

PRO 21:6  The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and
 fro of them that seek death.

PRO 21:7  The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to
 do judgment.

PRO 21:8  The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work
 is right.

PRO 21:9  It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a
 brawling woman in a wide house.

PRO 21:10  The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no
 favour in his eyes.

PRO 21:11  When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the
 wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

PRO 21:12  The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but
 God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.

PRO 21:13  Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry
 himself, but shall not be heard.

PRO 21:14  A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong
 wrath.

PRO 21:15  It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be
 to the workers of iniquity.

PRO 21:16  The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain
 in the congregation of the dead.

PRO 21:17  He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and
 oil shall not be rich.

PRO 21:18  The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor
 for the upright.

PRO 21:19  It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and
 an angry woman.

PRO 21:20  There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
 but a foolish man spendeth it up.

PRO 21:21  He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life,
 righteousness, and honour.

PRO 21:22  A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the
 strength of the confidence thereof.

PRO 21:23  Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
 troubles.

PRO 21:24  Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.

PRO 21:25  The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to
 labour.

PRO 21:26  He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and
 spareth not.

PRO 21:27  The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he
 bringeth it with a wicked mind?

PRO 21:28  A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh
 constantly.

PRO 21:29  A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he
 directeth his way.

PRO 21:30  There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.

PRO 21:31  The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is
 of the LORD.

PRO 22:1  A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving
 favour rather than silver and gold.

PRO 22:2  The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.

PRO 22:3  A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple
 pass on, and are punished.

PRO 22:4  By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and
 life.

PRO 22:5  Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep
 his soul shall be far from them.

PRO 22:6  Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will
 not depart from it.

PRO 22:7  The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the
 lender.

PRO 22:8  He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger
 shall fail.

PRO 22:9  He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his
 bread to the poor.

PRO 22:10  Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and
 reproach shall cease.

PRO 22:11  He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king
 shall be his friend.

PRO 22:12  The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the
 words of the transgressor.

PRO 22:13  The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain
 in the streets.

PRO 22:14  The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the
 LORD shall fall therein.

PRO 22:15  Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of
 correction shall drive it far from him.

PRO 22:16  He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that
 giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.

PRO 22:17  Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine
 heart unto my knowledge.

PRO 22:18  For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall
 withal be fitted in thy lips.

PRO 22:19  That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this
 day, even to thee.

PRO 22:20  Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and
 knowledge,

PRO 22:21  That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth;
 that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?

PRO 22:22  Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted
 in the gate:

PRO 22:23  For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those
 that spoiled them.

PRO 22:24  Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou
 shalt not go:

PRO 22:25  Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.

PRO 22:26  Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are
 sureties for debts.

PRO 22:27  If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from
 under thee?

PRO 22:28  Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.

PRO 22:29  Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before
 kings; he shall not stand before mean men.

PRO 23:1  When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is
 before thee:

PRO 23:2  And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.

PRO 23:3  Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.

PRO 23:4  Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

PRO 23:5  Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly
 make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.

PRO 23:6  Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire
 thou his dainty meats:

PRO 23:7  For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he
 to thee; but his heart is not with thee.

PRO 23:8  The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy
 sweet words.

PRO 23:9  Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of
 thy words.

PRO 23:10  Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the
 fatherless:

PRO 23:11  For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.

PRO 23:12  Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of
 knowledge.

PRO 23:13  Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with
 the rod, he shall not die.

PRO 23:14  Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from
 hell.

PRO 23:15  My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.

PRO 23:16  Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

PRO 23:17  Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the
 LORD all the day long.

PRO 23:18  For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut
 off.

PRO 23:19  Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.

PRO 23:20  Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

PRO 23:21  For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and
 drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.

PRO 23:22  Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother
 when she is old.

PRO 23:23  Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and
 understanding.

PRO 23:24  The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that
 begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.

PRO 23:25  Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee
 shall rejoice.

PRO 23:26  My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.

PRO 23:27  For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.

PRO 23:28  She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the
 transgressors among men.

PRO 23:29  Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath
 babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?

PRO 23:30  They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.

PRO 23:31  Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his
 colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

PRO 23:32  At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.

PRO 23:33  Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter
 perverse things.

PRO 23:34  Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or
 as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

PRO 23:35  They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have
 beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.

PRO 24:1  Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.

PRO 24:2  For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of
 mischief.

PRO 24:3  Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is
 established:

PRO 24:4  And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and
 pleasant riches.

PRO 24:5  A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.

PRO 24:6  For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of
 counsellors there is safety.

PRO 24:7  Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.

PRO 24:8  He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.

PRO 24:9  The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination
 to men.

PRO 24:10  If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.

PRO 24:11  If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those
 that are ready to be slain;

PRO 24:12  If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth
 the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and
 shall not he render to every man according to his works?

PRO 24:13  My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which
 is sweet to thy taste:

PRO 24:14  So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast
 found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut
 off.

PRO 24:15  Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;
 spoil not his resting place:

PRO 24:16  For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the
 wicked shall fall into mischief.

PRO 24:17  Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be
 glad when he stumbleth:

PRO 24:18  Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his
 wrath from him.

PRO 24:19  Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the
 wicked:

PRO 24:20  For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the
 wicked shall be put out.

PRO 24:21  My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them
 that are given to change:

PRO 24:22  For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin
 of them both?

PRO 24:23  These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect
 of persons in judgment.

PRO 24:24  He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall the
 people curse, nations shall abhor him:

PRO 24:25  But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing
 shall come upon them.

PRO 24:26  Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.

PRO 24:27  Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field;
 and afterwards build thine house.

PRO 24:28  Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive
 not with thy lips.

PRO 24:29  Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render
 to the man according to his work.

PRO 24:30  I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man
 void of understanding;

PRO 24:31  And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered
 the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.

PRO 24:32  Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received
 instruction.

PRO 24:33  Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands
 to sleep:

PRO 24:34  So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an
 armed man.

PRO 25:1  These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of
 Judah copied out.

PRO 25:2  It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is
 to search out a matter.

PRO 25:3  The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of
 kings is unsearchable.

PRO 25:4  Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a
 vessel for the finer.

PRO 25:5  Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be
 established in righteousness.

PRO 25:6  Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not
 in the place of great men:

PRO 25:7  For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that
 thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes
 have seen.

PRO 25:8  Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the
 end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.

PRO 25:9  Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a
 secret to another:

PRO 25:10  Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not
 away.

PRO 25:11  A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.

PRO 25:12  As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise
 reprover upon an obedient ear.

PRO 25:13  As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
 messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.

PRO 25:14  Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind
 without rain.

PRO 25:15  By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh
 the bone.

PRO 25:16  Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest
 thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.

PRO 25:17  Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary
 of thee, and so hate thee.

PRO 25:18  A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a
 maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.

PRO 25:19  Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken
 tooth, and a foot out of joint.

PRO 25:20  As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar
 upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.

PRO 25:21  If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be
 thirsty, give him water to drink:

PRO 25:22  For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall
 reward thee.

PRO 25:23  The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a
 backbiting tongue.

PRO 25:24  It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a
 brawling woman and in a wide house.

PRO 25:25  As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far
 country.

PRO 25:26  A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled
 fountain, and a corrupt spring.

PRO 25:27  It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own
 glory is not glory.

PRO 25:28  He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is
 broken down, and without walls.

PRO 26:1  As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly
 for a fool.

PRO 26:2  As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse
 causeless shall not come.

PRO 26:3  A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's
 back.

PRO 26:4  Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto
 him.

PRO 26:5  Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own
 conceit.

PRO 26:6  He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the
 feet, and drinketh damage.

PRO 26:7  The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of
 fools.

PRO 26:8  As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to
 a fool.

PRO 26:9  As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable
 in the mouths of fools.

PRO 26:10  The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and
 rewardeth transgressors.

PRO 26:11  As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly.

PRO 26:12  Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a
 fool than of him.

PRO 26:13  The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the
 streets.

PRO 26:14  As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his
 bed.

PRO 26:15  The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring
 it again to his mouth.

PRO 26:16  The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can
 render a reason.

PRO 26:17  He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him,
 is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.

PRO 26:18  As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,

PRO 26:19  So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in
 sport?

PRO 26:20  Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no
 talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

PRO 26:21  As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious
 man to kindle strife.

PRO 26:22  The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the
 innermost parts of the belly.

PRO 26:23  Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with
 silver dross.

PRO 26:24  He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit
 within him;

PRO 26:25  When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven
 abominations in his heart.

PRO 26:26  Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed
 before the whole congregation.

PRO 26:27  Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone,
 it will return upon him.

PRO 26:28  A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a
 flattering mouth worketh ruin.

PRO 27:1  Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
 bring forth.

PRO 27:2  Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and
 not thine own lips.

PRO 27:3  A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier
 than them both.

PRO 27:4  Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand
 before envy?

PRO 27:5  Open rebuke is better than secret love.

PRO 27:6  Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are
 deceitful.

PRO 27:7  The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every
 bitter thing is sweet.

PRO 27:8  As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth
 from his place.

PRO 27:9  Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a
 man's friend by hearty counsel.

PRO 27:10  Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go
 into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a
 neighbour that is near than a brother far off.

PRO 27:11  My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that
 reproacheth me.

PRO 27:12  A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple
 pass on, and are punished.

PRO 27:13  Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of
 him for a strange woman.

PRO 27:14  He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the
 morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

PRO 27:15  A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are
 alike.

PRO 27:16  Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right
 hand, which bewrayeth itself.

PRO 27:17  Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
 friend.

PRO 27:18  Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that
 waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

PRO 27:19  As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.

PRO 27:20  Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never
 satisfied.

PRO 27:21  As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man
 to his praise.

PRO 27:22  Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a
 pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

PRO 27:23  Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to
 thy herds.

PRO 27:24  For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every
 generation?

PRO 27:25  The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs
 of the mountains are gathered.

PRO 27:26  The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the
 field.

PRO 27:27  And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of
 thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.

PRO 28:1  The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a
 lion.

PRO 28:2  For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by
 a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.

PRO 28:3  A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which
 leaveth no food.

PRO 28:4  They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law
 contend with them.

PRO 28:5  Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD
 understand all things.

PRO 28:6  Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is
 perverse in his ways, though he be rich.

PRO 28:7  Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of
 riotous men shameth his father.

PRO 28:8  He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall
 gather it for him that will pity the poor.

PRO 28:9  He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer
 shall be abomination.

PRO 28:10  Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall
 fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in
 possession.

PRO 28:11  The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath
 understanding searcheth him out.

PRO 28:12  When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the
 wicked rise, a man is hidden.

PRO 28:13  He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth
 and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

PRO 28:14  Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart
 shall fall into mischief.

PRO 28:15  As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the
 poor people.

PRO 28:16  The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but
 he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.

PRO 28:17  A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee
 to the pit; let no man stay him.

PRO 28:18  Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in
 his ways shall fall at once.

PRO 28:19  He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that
 followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.

PRO 28:20  A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste
 to be rich shall not be innocent.

PRO 28:21  To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread
 that man will transgress.

PRO 28:22  He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not
 that poverty shall come upon him.

PRO 28:23  He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he
 that flattereth with the tongue.

PRO 28:24  Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no
 transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.

PRO 28:25  He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth
 his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

PRO 28:26  He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh
 wisely, he shall be delivered.

PRO 28:27  He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his
 eyes shall have many a curse.

PRO 28:28  When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the
 righteous increase.

PRO 29:1  He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be
 destroyed, and that without remedy.

PRO 29:2  When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the
 wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.

PRO 29:3  Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company
 with harlots spendeth his substance.

PRO 29:4  The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth
 gifts overthroweth it.

PRO 29:5  A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.

PRO 29:6  In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the
 righteous doth sing and rejoice.

PRO 29:7  The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked
 regardeth not to know it.

PRO 29:8  Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.

PRO 29:9  If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or
 laugh, there is no rest.

PRO 29:10  The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.

PRO 29:11  A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till
 afterwards.

PRO 29:12  If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.

PRO 29:13  The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth
 both their eyes.

PRO 29:14  The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be
 established for ever.

PRO 29:15  The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself
 bringeth his mother to shame.

PRO 29:16  When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the
 righteous shall see their fall.

PRO 29:17  Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give
 delight unto thy soul.

PRO 29:18  Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the
 law, happy is he.

PRO 29:19  A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand
 he will not answer.

PRO 29:20  Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a
 fool than of him.

PRO 29:21  He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have
 him become his son at the length.

PRO 29:22  An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in
 transgression.

PRO 29:23  A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the
 humble in spirit.

PRO 29:24  Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth
 cursing, and bewrayeth it not.

PRO 29:25  The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the
 LORD shall be safe.

PRO 29:26  Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from
 the LORD.

PRO 29:27  An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright
 in the way is abomination to the wicked.

PRO 30:1  The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake
 unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,

PRO 30:2  Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding
 of a man.

PRO 30:3  I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

PRO 30:4  Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the
 wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath
 established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his
 son's name, if thou canst tell?

PRO 30:5  Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their
 trust in him.

PRO 30:6  Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found
 a liar.

PRO 30:7  Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:

PRO 30:8  Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor
 riches; feed me with food convenient for me:

PRO 30:9  Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be
 poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.

PRO 30:10  Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou
 be found guilty.

PRO 30:11  There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless
 their mother.

PRO 30:12  There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is
 not washed from their filthiness.

PRO 30:13  There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids
 are lifted up.

PRO 30:14  There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw
 teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from
 among men.

PRO 30:15  The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are
 three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is
 enough:

PRO 30:16  The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with
 water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.

PRO 30:17  The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his
 mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles
 shall eat it.

PRO 30:18  There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four
 which I know not:

PRO 30:19  The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock;
 the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.

PRO 30:20  Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her
 mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

PRO 30:21  For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it
 cannot bear:

PRO 30:22  For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with
 meat;

PRO 30:23  For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is
 heir to her mistress.

PRO 30:24  There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are
 exceeding wise:

PRO 30:25  The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the
 summer;

PRO 30:26  The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the
 rocks;

PRO 30:27  The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;

PRO 30:28  The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.

PRO 30:29  There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:

PRO 30:30  A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for
 any;

PRO 30:31  A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no
 rising up.

PRO 30:32  If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast
 thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.

PRO 30:33  Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing
 of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth
 strife.

PRO 31:1  The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.

PRO 31:2  What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my
 vows?

PRO 31:3  Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which
 destroyeth kings.

PRO 31:4  It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor
 for princes strong drink:

PRO 31:5  Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any
 of the afflicted.

PRO 31:6  Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto
 those that be of heavy hearts.

PRO 31:7  Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no
 more.

PRO 31:8  Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed
 to destruction.

PRO 31:9  Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor
 and needy.

PRO 31:10  Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.

PRO 31:11  The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall
 have no need of spoil.

PRO 31:12  She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

PRO 31:13  She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.

PRO 31:14  She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.

PRO 31:15  She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her
 household, and a portion to her maidens.

PRO 31:16  She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands
 she planteth a vineyard.

PRO 31:17  She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.

PRO 31:18  She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not
 out by night.

PRO 31:19  She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.

PRO 31:20  She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her
 hands to the needy.

PRO 31:21  She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
 household are clothed with scarlet.

PRO 31:22  She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and
 purple.

PRO 31:23  Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders
 of the land.

PRO 31:24  She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto
 the merchant.

PRO 31:25  Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time
 to come.

PRO 31:26  She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of
 kindness.

PRO 31:27  She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the
 bread of idleness.

PRO 31:28  Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and
 he praiseth her.

PRO 31:29  Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.

PRO 31:30  Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth
 the LORD, she shall be praised.

PRO 31:31  Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her
 in the gates.

PSA 1:1  Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
 standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

PSA 1:2  But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he
 meditate day and night.

PSA 1:3  And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
 bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and
 whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

PSA 1:4  The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth
 away.

PSA 1:5  Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners
 in the congregation of the righteous.

PSA 1:6  For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the
 ungodly shall perish.

PSA 2:1  Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

PSA 2:2  The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
 together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,

PSA 2:3  Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.

PSA 2:4  He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them
 in derision.

PSA 2:5  Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore
 displeasure.

PSA 2:6  Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

PSA 2:7  I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my
 Son; this day have I begotten thee.

PSA 2:8  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
 inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

PSA 2:9  Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in
 pieces like a potter's vessel.

PSA 2:10  Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the
 earth.

PSA 2:11  Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

PSA 2:12  Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his
 wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in
 him.

PSA 3:1  Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise
 up against me.

PSA 3:2  Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God.
 Selah.

PSA 3:3  But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of
 mine head.

PSA 3:4  I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy
 hill. Selah.

PSA 3:5  I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

PSA 3:6  I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
 themselves against me round about.

PSA 3:7  Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine
 enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

PSA 3:8  Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people.
 Selah.

PSA 4:1  Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me
 when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.

PSA 4:2  O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long
 will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.

PSA 4:3  But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself:
 the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

PSA 4:4  Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your
 bed, and be still. Selah.

PSA 4:5  Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.

PSA 4:6  There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up
 the light of thy countenance upon us.

PSA 4:7  Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their
 corn and their wine increased.

PSA 4:8  I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only
 makest me dwell in safety.

PSA 5:1  Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

PSA 5:2  Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee
 will I pray.

PSA 5:3  My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I
 direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

PSA 5:4  For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall
 evil dwell with thee.

PSA 5:5  The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of
 iniquity.

PSA 5:6  Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the
 bloody and deceitful man.

PSA 5:7  But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy
 mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.

PSA 5:8  Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make
 thy way straight before my face.

PSA 5:9  For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very
 wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their
 tongue.

PSA 5:10  Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast
 them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled
 against thee.

PSA 5:11  But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever
 shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name
 be joyful in thee.

PSA 5:12  For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou
 compass him as with a shield.

PSA 6:1  O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot
 displeasure.

PSA 6:2  Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my
 bones are vexed.

PSA 6:3  My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

PSA 6:4  Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.

PSA 6:5  For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall
 give thee thanks?

PSA 6:6  I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I
 water my couch with my tears.

PSA 6:7  Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all
 mine enemies.

PSA 6:8  Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard
 the voice of my weeping.

PSA 6:9  The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.

PSA 6:10  Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and
 be ashamed suddenly.

PSA 7:1  O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that
 persecute me, and deliver me:

PSA 7:2  Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is
 none to deliver.

PSA 7:3  O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;

PSA 7:4  If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I
 have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

PSA 7:5  Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down
 my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.

PSA 7:6  Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of
 mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.

PSA 7:7  So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their
 sakes therefore return thou on high.

PSA 7:8  The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my
 righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.

PSA 7:9  Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the
 just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.

PSA 7:10  My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

PSA 7:11  God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every
 day.

PSA 7:12  If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and
 made it ready.

PSA 7:13  He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth
 his arrows against the persecutors.

PSA 7:14  Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and
 brought forth falsehood.

PSA 7:15  He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he
 made.

PSA 7:16  His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing
 shall come down upon his own pate.

PSA 7:17  I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing
 praise to the name of the LORD most high.

PSA 8:1  O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast
 set thy glory above the heavens.

PSA 8:2  Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength
 because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.

PSA 8:3  When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the
 stars, which thou hast ordained;

PSA 8:4  What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that
 thou visitest him?

PSA 8:5  For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast
 crowned him with glory and honour.

PSA 8:6  Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou
 hast put all things under his feet:

PSA 8:7  All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

PSA 8:8  The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth
 through the paths of the seas.

PSA 8:9  O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

PSA 9:1  I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all
 thy marvellous works.

PSA 9:2  I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O
 thou most High.

PSA 9:3  When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy
 presence.

PSA 9:4  For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the
 throne judging right.

PSA 9:5  Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou
 hast put out their name for ever and ever.

PSA 9:6  O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast
 destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.

PSA 9:7  But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for
 judgment.

PSA 9:8  And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister
 judgment to the people in uprightness.

PSA 9:9  The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of
 trouble.

PSA 9:10  And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou,
 LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

PSA 9:11  Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the
 people his doings.

PSA 9:12  When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
 forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

PSA 9:13  Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer
 of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:

PSA 9:14  That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of
 Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

PSA 9:15  The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which
 they hid is their own foot taken.

PSA 9:16  The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is
 snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.

PSA 9:17  The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget
 God.

PSA 9:18  For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the
 poor shall not perish for ever.

PSA 9:19  Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy
 sight.

PSA 9:20  Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be
 but men. Selah.

PSA 10:1  Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times
 of trouble?

PSA 10:2  The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken
 in the devices that they have imagined.

PSA 10:3  For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the
 covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.

PSA 10:4  The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after
 God: God is not in all his thoughts.

PSA 10:5  His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his
 sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

PSA 10:6  He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be
 in adversity.

PSA 10:7  His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue
 is mischief and vanity.

PSA 10:8  He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret
 places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the
 poor.

PSA 10:9  He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to
 catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.

PSA 10:10  He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his
 strong ones.

PSA 10:11  He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face;
 he will never see it.

PSA 10:12  Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.

PSA 10:13  Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart,
 Thou wilt not require it.

PSA 10:14  Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite
 it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper
 of the fatherless.

PSA 10:15  Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his
 wickedness till thou find none.

PSA 10:16  The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of
 his land.

PSA 10:17  LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare
 their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

PSA 10:18  To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth
 may no more oppress.

PSA 11:1  In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to
 your mountain?

PSA 11:2  For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon
 the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.

PSA 11:3  If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

PSA 11:4  The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his
 eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

PSA 11:5  The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth
 violence his soul hateth.

PSA 11:6  Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an
 horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.

PSA 11:7  For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth
 behold the upright.

PSA 12:1  Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from
 among the children of men.

PSA 12:2  They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips
 and with a double heart do they speak.

PSA 12:3  The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that
 speaketh proud things:

PSA 12:4  Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own:
 who is lord over us?

PSA 12:5  For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now
 will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth
 at him.

PSA 12:6  The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of
 earth, purified seven times.

PSA 12:7  Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this
 generation for ever.

PSA 12:8  The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.

PSA 13:1  How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou
 hide thy face from me?

PSA 13:2  How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart
 daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

PSA 13:3  Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep
 the sleep of death;

PSA 13:4  Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that
 trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

PSA 13:5  But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
 salvation.

PSA 13:6  I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.

PSA 14:1  The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
 corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.

PSA 14:2  The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
 there were any that did understand, and seek God.

PSA 14:3  They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there
 is none that doeth good, no, not one.

PSA 14:4  Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people
 as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

PSA 14:5  There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the
 righteous.

PSA 14:6  Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his
 refuge.

PSA 14:7  Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD
 bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel
 shall be glad.

PSA 15:1  Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy
 hill?

PSA 15:2  He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh
 the truth in his heart.

PSA 15:3  He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
 neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

PSA 15:4  In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that
 fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.

PSA 15:5  He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against
 the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.

PSA 16:1  Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

PSA 16:2  O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
 goodness extendeth not to thee;

PSA 16:3  But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in
 whom is all my delight.

PSA 16:4  Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god:
 their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into
 my lips.

PSA 16:5  The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou
 maintainest my lot.

PSA 16:6  The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
 heritage.

PSA 16:7  I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also
 instruct me in the night seasons.

PSA 16:8  I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand,
 I shall not be moved.

PSA 16:9  Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also
 shall rest in hope.

PSA 16:10  For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer
 thine Holy One to see corruption.

PSA 16:11  Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of
 joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

PSA 17:1  Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer,
 that goeth not out of feigned lips.

PSA 17:2  Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold
 the things that are equal.

PSA 17:3  Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou
 hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not
 transgress.

PSA 17:4  Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me
 from the paths of the destroyer.

PSA 17:5  Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

PSA 17:6  I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine
 ear unto me, and hear my speech.

PSA 17:7  Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right
 hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.

PSA 17:8  Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy
 wings,

PSA 17:9  From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass
 me about.

PSA 17:10  They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak
 proudly.

PSA 17:11  They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes
 bowing down to the earth;

PSA 17:12  Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young
 lion lurking in secret places.

PSA 17:13  Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from
 the wicked, which is thy sword:

PSA 17:14  From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which
 have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid
 treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance
 to their babes.

PSA 17:15  As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
 satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

PSA 18:1  I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

PSA 18:2  The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my
 strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and
 my high tower.

PSA 18:3  I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be
 saved from mine enemies.

PSA 18:4  The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made
 me afraid.

PSA 18:5  The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented
 me.

PSA 18:6  In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he
 heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his
 ears.

PSA 18:7  Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills
 moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

PSA 18:8  There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
 devoured: coals were kindled by it.

PSA 18:9  He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his
 feet.

PSA 18:10  And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the
 wings of the wind.

PSA 18:11  He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were
 dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

PSA 18:12  At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail
 stones and coals of fire.

PSA 18:13  The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his
 voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

PSA 18:14  Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out
 lightnings, and discomfited them.

PSA 18:15  Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the
 world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of
 thy nostrils.

PSA 18:16  He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

PSA 18:17  He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me:
 for they were too strong for me.

PSA 18:18  They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my
 stay.

PSA 18:19  He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
 because he delighted in me.

PSA 18:20  The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the
 cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

PSA 18:21  For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed
 from my God.

PSA 18:22  For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his
 statutes from me.

PSA 18:23  I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.

PSA 18:24  Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
 righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.

PSA 18:25  With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright
 man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

PSA 18:26  With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou
 wilt shew thyself froward.

PSA 18:27  For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high
 looks.

PSA 18:28  For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my
 darkness.

PSA 18:29  For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped
 over a wall.

PSA 18:30  As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is
 a buckler to all those that trust in him.

PSA 18:31  For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?

PSA 18:32  It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.

PSA 18:33  He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high
 places.

PSA 18:34  He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by
 mine arms.

PSA 18:35  Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right
 hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.

PSA 18:36  Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.

PSA 18:37  I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn
 again till they were consumed.

PSA 18:38  I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen
 under my feet.

PSA 18:39  For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast
 subdued under me those that rose up against me.

PSA 18:40  Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might
 destroy them that hate me.

PSA 18:41  They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but
 he answered them not.

PSA 18:42  Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast
 them out as the dirt in the streets.

PSA 18:43  Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou
 hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall
 serve me.

PSA 18:44  As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall
 submit themselves unto me.

PSA 18:45  The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close
 places.

PSA 18:46  The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
 salvation be exalted.

PSA 18:47  It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

PSA 18:48  He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above
 those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.

PSA 18:49  Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
 heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

PSA 18:50  Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his
 anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

PSA 19:1  The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his
 handywork.

PSA 19:2  Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.

PSA 19:3  There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

PSA 19:4  Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the
 end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

PSA 19:5  Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as
 a strong man to run a race.

PSA 19:6  His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto
 the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.

PSA 19:7  The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony
 of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

PSA 19:8  The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
 commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

PSA 19:9  The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments
 of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

PSA 19:10  More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
 sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

PSA 19:11  Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there
 is great reward.

PSA 19:12  Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.

PSA 19:13  Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have
 dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the
 great transgression.

PSA 19:14  Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
 acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.

PSA 20:1  The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of
 Jacob defend thee;

PSA 20:2  Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;

PSA 20:3  Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.

PSA 20:4  Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.

PSA 20:5  We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will
 set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

PSA 20:6  Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from
 his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.

PSA 20:7  Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
 name of the LORD our God.

PSA 20:8  They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
 upright.

PSA 20:9  Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

PSA 21:1  The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how
 greatly shall he rejoice!

PSA 21:2  Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the
 request of his lips. Selah.

PSA 21:3  For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest
 a crown of pure gold on his head.

PSA 21:4  He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days
 for ever and ever.

PSA 21:5  His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou
 laid upon him.

PSA 21:6  For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him
 exceeding glad with thy countenance.

PSA 21:7  For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most
 High he shall not be moved.

PSA 21:8  Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall
 find out those that hate thee.

PSA 21:9  Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the
 LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

PSA 21:10  Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from
 among the children of men.

PSA 21:11  For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous
 device, which they are not able to perform.

PSA 21:12  Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make
 ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.

PSA 21:13  Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and
 praise thy power.

PSA 22:1  My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from
 helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

PSA 22:2  O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the
 night season, and am not silent.

PSA 22:3  But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.

PSA 22:4  Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver
 them.

PSA 22:5  They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and
 were not confounded.

PSA 22:6  But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the
 people.

PSA 22:7  All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they
 shake the head, saying,

PSA 22:8  He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver
 him, seeing he delighted in him.

PSA 22:9  But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope
 when I was upon my mother's breasts.

PSA 22:10  I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's
 belly.

PSA 22:11  Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.

PSA 22:12  Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me
 round.

PSA 22:13  They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring
 lion.

PSA 22:14  I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my
 heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

PSA 22:15  My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to
 my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.

PSA 22:16  For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed
 me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

PSA 22:17  I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

PSA 22:18  They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.

PSA 22:19  But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to
 help me.

PSA 22:20  Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the
 dog.

PSA 22:21  Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns
 of the unicorns.

PSA 22:22  I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
 congregation will I praise thee.

PSA 22:23  Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify
 him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

PSA 22:24  For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
 afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him,
 he heard.

PSA 22:25  My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my
 vows before them that fear him.

PSA 22:26  The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that
 seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

PSA 22:27  All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and
 all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.

PSA 22:28  For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the
 nations.

PSA 22:29  All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that
 go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own
 soul.

PSA 22:30  A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
 generation.

PSA 22:31  They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people
 that shall be born, that he hath done this.

PSA 23:1  The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

PSA 23:2  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
 still waters.

PSA 23:3  He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for
 his name's sake.

PSA 23:4  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
 fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

PSA 23:5  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
 thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

PSA 23:6  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:
 and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

PSA 24:1  The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
 that dwell therein.

PSA 24:2  For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the
 floods.

PSA 24:3  Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his
 holy place?

PSA 24:4  He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up
 his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

PSA 24:5  He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from
 the God of his salvation.

PSA 24:6  This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O
 Jacob. Selah.

PSA 24:7  Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
 doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

PSA 24:8  Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD
 mighty in battle.

PSA 24:9  Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting
 doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

PSA 24:10  Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of
 glory. Selah.

PSA 25:1  Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

PSA 25:2  O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
 enemies triumph over me.

PSA 25:3  Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which
 transgress without cause.

PSA 25:4  Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

PSA 25:5  Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
 salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

PSA 25:6  Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for
 they have been ever of old.

PSA 25:7  Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according
 to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.

PSA 25:8  Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the
 way.

PSA 25:9  The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his
 way.

PSA 25:10  All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his
 covenant and his testimonies.

PSA 25:11  For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.

PSA 25:12  What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way
 that he shall choose.

PSA 25:13  His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.

PSA 25:14  The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew
 them his covenant.

PSA 25:15  Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out
 of the net.

PSA 25:16  Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and
 afflicted.

PSA 25:17  The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my
 distresses.

PSA 25:18  Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.

PSA 25:19  Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with
 cruel hatred.

PSA 25:20  O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my
 trust in thee.

PSA 25:21  Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

PSA 25:22  Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

PSA 26:1  Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted
 also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

PSA 26:2  Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

PSA 26:3  For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy
 truth.

PSA 26:4  I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
 dissemblers.

PSA 26:5  I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with
 the wicked.

PSA 26:6  I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O
 LORD:

PSA 26:7  That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all
 thy wondrous works.

PSA 26:8  LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where
 thine honour dwelleth.

PSA 26:9  Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

PSA 26:10  In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.

PSA 26:11  But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be
 merciful unto me.

PSA 26:12  My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless
 the LORD.

PSA 27:1  The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is
 the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

PSA 27:2  When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat
 up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

PSA 27:3  Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:
 though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.

PSA 27:4  One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I
 may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the
 beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.

PSA 27:5  For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the
 secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.

PSA 27:6  And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about
 me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing,
 yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

PSA 27:7  Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and
 answer me.

PSA 27:8  When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face,
 LORD, will I seek.

PSA 27:9  Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger:
 thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
 salvation.

PSA 27:10  When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me
 up.

PSA 27:11  Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of
 mine enemies.

PSA 27:12  Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
 witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.

PSA 27:13  I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD
 in the land of the living.

PSA 27:14  Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine
 heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

PSA 28:1  Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if
 thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.

PSA 28:2  Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift
 up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

PSA 28:3  Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity,
 which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.

PSA 28:4  Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness
 of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them
 their desert.

PSA 28:5  Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of
 his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.

PSA 28:6  Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
 supplications.

PSA 28:7  The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I
 am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I
 praise him.

PSA 28:8  The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his
 anointed.

PSA 28:9  Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and
 lift them up for ever.

PSA 29:1  Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
 strength.

PSA 29:2  Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD
 in the beauty of holiness.

PSA 29:3  The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
 thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.

PSA 29:4  The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of
 majesty.

PSA 29:5  The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the
 cedars of Lebanon.

PSA 29:6  He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a
 young unicorn.

PSA 29:7  The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.

PSA 29:8  The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the
 wilderness of Kadesh.

PSA 29:9  The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the
 forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.

PSA 29:10  The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for
 ever.

PSA 29:11  The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his
 people with peace.

PSA 30:1  I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not
 made my foes to rejoice over me.

PSA 30:2  O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

PSA 30:3  O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept
 me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

PSA 30:4  Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
 remembrance of his holiness.

PSA 30:5  For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping
 may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

PSA 30:6  And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

PSA 30:7  LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou
 didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

PSA 30:8  I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.

PSA 30:9  What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall
 the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

PSA 30:10  Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

PSA 30:11  Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off
 my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

PSA 30:12  To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent.
 O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

PSA 31:1  In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver
 me in thy righteousness.

PSA 31:2  Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong
 rock, for an house of defence to save me.

PSA 31:3  For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake
 lead me, and guide me.

PSA 31:4  Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou
 art my strength.

PSA 31:5  Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God
 of truth.

PSA 31:6  I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the
 LORD.

PSA 31:7  I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my
 trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

PSA 31:8  And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my
 feet in a large room.

PSA 31:9  Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed
 with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

PSA 31:10  For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
 strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.

PSA 31:11  I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my
 neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without
 fled from me.

PSA 31:12  I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.

PSA 31:13  For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while
 they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.

PSA 31:14  But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.

PSA 31:15  My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies,
 and from them that persecute me.

PSA 31:16  Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies'
 sake.

PSA 31:17  Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the
 wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.

PSA 31:18  Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things
 proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

PSA 31:19  Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that
 fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the
 sons of men!

PSA 31:20  Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of
 man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.

PSA 31:21  Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness
 in a strong city.

PSA 31:22  For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
 nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto
 thee.

PSA 31:23  O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the
 faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

PSA 31:24  Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that
 hope in the LORD.

PSA 32:1  Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

PSA 32:2  Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in
 whose spirit there is no guile.

PSA 32:3  When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the
 day long.

PSA 32:4  For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned
 into the drought of summer. Selah.

PSA 32:5  I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
 said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the
 iniquity of my sin. Selah.

PSA 32:6  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when
 thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not
 come nigh unto him.

PSA 32:7  Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou
 shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

PSA 32:8  I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I
 will guide thee with mine eye.

PSA 32:9  Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding:
 whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto
 thee.

PSA 32:10  Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the
 LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

PSA 32:11  Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy,
 all ye that are upright in heart.

PSA 33:1  Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the
 upright.

PSA 33:2  Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an
 instrument of ten strings.

PSA 33:3  Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

PSA 33:4  For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in
 truth.

PSA 33:5  He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
 goodness of the LORD.

PSA 33:6  By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host
 of them by the breath of his mouth.

PSA 33:7  He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up
 the depth in storehouses.

PSA 33:8  Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world
 stand in awe of him.

PSA 33:9  For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.

PSA 33:10  The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh
 the devices of the people of none effect.

PSA 33:11  The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart
 to all generations.

PSA 33:12  Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he
 hath chosen for his own inheritance.

PSA 33:13  The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.

PSA 33:14  From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants
 of the earth.

PSA 33:15  He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.

PSA 33:16  There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is
 not delivered by much strength.

PSA 33:17  An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by
 his great strength.

PSA 33:18  Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them
 that hope in his mercy;

PSA 33:19  To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.

PSA 33:20  Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.

PSA 33:21  For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his
 holy name.

PSA 33:22  Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.

PSA 34:1  I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be
 in my mouth.

PSA 34:2  My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear
 thereof, and be glad.

PSA 34:3  O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.

PSA 34:4  I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my
 fears.

PSA 34:5  They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
 ashamed.

PSA 34:6  This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all
 his troubles.

PSA 34:7  The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and
 delivereth them.

PSA 34:8  O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
 trusteth in him.

PSA 34:9  O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that
 fear him.

PSA 34:10  The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the
 LORD shall not want any good thing.

PSA 34:11  Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the
 LORD.

PSA 34:12  What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may
 see good?

PSA 34:13  Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

PSA 34:14  Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

PSA 34:15  The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open
 unto their cry.

PSA 34:16  The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the
 remembrance of them from the earth.

PSA 34:17  The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of
 all their troubles.

PSA 34:18  The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth
 such as be of a contrite spirit.

PSA 34:19  Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth
 him out of them all.

PSA 34:20  He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

PSA 34:21  Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall
 be desolate.

PSA 34:22  The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that
 trust in him shall be desolate.

PSA 35:1  Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against
 them that fight against me.

PSA 35:2  Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

PSA 35:3  Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute
 me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

PSA 35:4  Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let
 them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.

PSA 35:5  Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD
 chase them.

PSA 35:6  Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD
 persecute them.

PSA 35:7  For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which
 without cause they have digged for my soul.

PSA 35:8  Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he
 hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.

PSA 35:9  And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his
 salvation.

PSA 35:10  All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
 deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and
 the needy from him that spoileth him?

PSA 35:11  False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I
 knew not.

PSA 35:12  They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

PSA 35:13  But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I
 humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.

PSA 35:14  I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed
 down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.

PSA 35:15  But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
 together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I
 knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:

PSA 35:16  With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their
 teeth.

PSA 35:17  Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
 destructions, my darling from the lions.

PSA 35:18  I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise
 thee among much people.

PSA 35:19  Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
 neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.

PSA 35:20  For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against
 them that are quiet in the land.

PSA 35:21  Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha,
 our eye hath seen it.

PSA 35:22  This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far
 from me.

PSA 35:23  Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my
 God and my Lord.

PSA 35:24  Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let
 them not rejoice over me.

PSA 35:25  Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them
 not say, We have swallowed him up.

PSA 35:26  Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice
 at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify
 themselves against me.

PSA 35:27  Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause:
 yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure
 in the prosperity of his servant.

PSA 35:28  And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all
 the day long.

PSA 36:1  The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is
 no fear of God before his eyes.

PSA 36:2  For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be
 found to be hateful.

PSA 36:3  The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to
 be wise, and to do good.

PSA 36:4  He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that
 is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

PSA 36:5  Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth
 unto the clouds.

PSA 36:6  Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a
 great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

PSA 36:7  How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of
 men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

PSA 36:8  They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and
 thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.

PSA 36:9  For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see
 light.

PSA 36:10  O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy
 righteousness to the upright in heart.

PSA 36:11  Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand
 of the wicked remove me.

PSA 36:12  There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and
 shall not be able to rise.

PSA 37:1  Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
 against the workers of iniquity.

PSA 37:2  For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the
 green herb.

PSA 37:3  Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and
 verily thou shalt be fed.

PSA 37:4  Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires
 of thine heart.

PSA 37:5  Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring
 it to pass.

PSA 37:6  And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
 judgment as the noonday.

PSA 37:7  Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
 because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth
 wicked devices to pass.

PSA 37:8  Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to
 do evil.

PSA 37:9  For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
 LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

PSA 37:10  For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt
 diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

PSA 37:11  But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves
 in the abundance of peace.

PSA 37:12  The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his
 teeth.

PSA 37:13  The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.

PSA 37:14  The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to
 cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.

PSA 37:15  Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall
 be broken.

PSA 37:16  A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many
 wicked.

PSA 37:17  For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth
 the righteous.

PSA 37:18  The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance
 shall be for ever.

PSA 37:19  They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
 famine they shall be satisfied.

PSA 37:20  But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as
 the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.

PSA 37:21  The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
 sheweth mercy, and giveth.

PSA 37:22  For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that
 be cursed of him shall be cut off.

PSA 37:23  The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth
 in his way.

PSA 37:24  Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD
 upholdeth him with his hand.

PSA 37:25  I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous
 forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

PSA 37:26  He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

PSA 37:27  Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

PSA 37:28  For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are
 preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.

PSA 37:29  The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.

PSA 37:30  The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh
 of judgment.

PSA 37:31  The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.

PSA 37:32  The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

PSA 37:33  The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is
 judged.

PSA 37:34  Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
 inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.

PSA 37:35  I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a
 green bay tree.

PSA 37:36  Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he
 could not be found.

PSA 37:37  Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that
 man is peace.

PSA 37:38  But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the
 wicked shall be cut off.

PSA 37:39  But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
 strength in the time of trouble.

PSA 37:40  And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver
 them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.

PSA 38:1  O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot
 displeasure.

PSA 38:2  For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.

PSA 38:3  There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is
 there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

PSA 38:4  For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they
 are too heavy for me.

PSA 38:5  My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

PSA 38:6  I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day
 long.

PSA 38:7  For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no
 soundness in my flesh.

PSA 38:8  I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
 disquietness of my heart.

PSA 38:9  Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from
 thee.

PSA 38:10  My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine
 eyes, it also is gone from me.

PSA 38:11  My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen
 stand afar off.

PSA 38:12  They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that
 seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.

PSA 38:13  But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
 openeth not his mouth.

PSA 38:14  Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no
 reproofs.

PSA 38:15  For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

PSA 38:16  For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me:
 when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

PSA 38:17  For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.

PSA 38:18  For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

PSA 38:19  But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate
 me wrongfully are multiplied.

PSA 38:20  They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I
 follow the thing that good is.

PSA 38:21  Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

PSA 38:22  Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.

PSA 39:1  I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I
 will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.

PSA 39:2  I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my
 sorrow was stirred.

PSA 39:3  My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then
 spake I with my tongue,

PSA 39:4  LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it
 is: that I may know how frail I am.

PSA 39:5  Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as
 nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity.
 Selah.

PSA 39:6  Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted
 in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.

PSA 39:7  And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.

PSA 39:8  Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach
 of the foolish.

PSA 39:9  I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.

PSA 39:10  Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine
 hand.

PSA 39:11  When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest
 his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.

PSA 39:12  Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace
 at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my
 fathers were.

PSA 39:13  O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be
 no more.

PSA 40:1  I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard
 my cry.

PSA 40:2  He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
 clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

PSA 40:3  And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God:
 many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

PSA 40:4  Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth
 not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

PSA 40:5  Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
 done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in
 order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can
 be numbered.

PSA 40:6  Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou
 opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.

PSA 40:7  Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of
 me,

PSA 40:8  I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.

PSA 40:9  I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have
 not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

PSA 40:10  I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared
 thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness
 and thy truth from the great congregation.

PSA 40:11  Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
 lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

PSA 40:12  For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have
 taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the
 hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.

PSA 40:13  Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.

PSA 40:14  Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul
 to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me
 evil.

PSA 40:15  Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me,
 Aha, aha.

PSA 40:16  Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such
 as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.

PSA 40:17  But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my
 help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

PSA 41:1  Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in
 time of trouble.

PSA 41:2  The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be
 blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his
 enemies.

PSA 41:3  The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt
 make all his bed in his sickness.

PSA 41:4  I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned
 against thee.

PSA 41:5  Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
 perish?

PSA 41:6  And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth
 iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.

PSA 41:7  All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they
 devise my hurt.

PSA 41:8  An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he
 lieth he shall rise up no more.

PSA 41:9  Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my
 bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

PSA 41:10  But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may
 requite them.

PSA 41:11  By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not
 triumph over me.

PSA 41:12  And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me
 before thy face for ever.

PSA 41:13  Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
 everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

PSA 42:1  As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after
 thee, O God.

PSA 42:2  My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and
 appear before God?

PSA 42:3  My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say
 unto me, Where is thy God?

PSA 42:4  When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had
 gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice
 of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.

PSA 42:5  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me?
 hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.

PSA 42:6  O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember
 thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.

PSA 42:7  Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves
 and thy billows are gone over me.

PSA 42:8  Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and
 in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my
 life.

PSA 42:9  I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I
 mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

PSA 42:10  As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they
 say daily unto me, Where is thy God?

PSA 42:11  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
 within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of
 my countenance, and my God.

PSA 43:1  Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O
 deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

PSA 43:2  For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why
 go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

PSA 43:3  O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring
 me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

PSA 43:4  Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea,
 upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

PSA 43:5  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within
 me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my
 countenance, and my God.

PSA 44:1  We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what
 work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

PSA 44:2  How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst
 them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.

PSA 44:3  For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither
 did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light
 of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.

PSA 44:4  Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

PSA 44:5  Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we
 tread them under that rise up against us.

PSA 44:6  For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.

PSA 44:7  But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame
 that hated us.

PSA 44:8  In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.
 Selah.

PSA 44:9  But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with
 our armies.

PSA 44:10  Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us
 spoil for themselves.

PSA 44:11  Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered
 us among the heathen.

PSA 44:12  Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth
 by their price.

PSA 44:13  Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision
 to them that are round about us.

PSA 44:14  Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head
 among the people.

PSA 44:15  My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath
 covered me,

PSA 44:16  For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason
 of the enemy and avenger.

PSA 44:17  All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither
 have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

PSA 44:18  Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from
 thy way;

PSA 44:19  Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered
 us with the shadow of death.

PSA 44:20  If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands
 to a strange god;

PSA 44:21  Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the
 heart.

PSA 44:22  Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as
 sheep for the slaughter.

PSA 44:23  Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.

PSA 44:24  Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and
 our oppression?

PSA 44:25  For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
 earth.

PSA 44:26  Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.

PSA 45:1  My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I
 have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

PSA 45:2  Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy
 lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

PSA 45:3  Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy
 majesty.

PSA 45:4  And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness
 and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.

PSA 45:5  Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby
 the people fall under thee.

PSA 45:6  Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom
 is a right sceptre.

PSA 45:7  Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy
 God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

PSA 45:8  All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the
 ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

PSA 45:9  Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand
 did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

PSA 45:10  Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget
 also thine own people, and thy father's house;

PSA 45:11  So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and
 worship thou him.

PSA 45:12  And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich
 among the people shall intreat thy favour.

PSA 45:13  The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
 wrought gold.

PSA 45:14  She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the
 virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.

PSA 45:15  With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter
 into the king's palace.

PSA 45:16  Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make
 princes in all the earth.

PSA 45:17  I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore
 shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

PSA 46:1  God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

PSA 46:2  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though
 the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

PSA 46:3  Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains
 shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

PSA 46:4  There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of
 God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

PSA 46:5  God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help
 her, and that right early.

PSA 46:6  The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the
 earth melted.

PSA 46:7  The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

PSA 46:8  Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made
 in the earth.

PSA 46:9  He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the
 bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.

PSA 46:10  Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
 heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

PSA 46:11  The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

PSA 47:1  O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of
 triumph.

PSA 47:2  For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the
 earth.

PSA 47:3  He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.

PSA 47:4  He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom
 he loved. Selah.

PSA 47:5  God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.

PSA 47:6  Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing
 praises.

PSA 47:7  For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
 understanding.

PSA 47:8  God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his
 holiness.

PSA 47:9  The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people
 of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is
 greatly exalted.

PSA 48:1  Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God,
 in the mountain of his holiness.

PSA 48:2  Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion,
 on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

PSA 48:3  God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

PSA 48:4  For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

PSA 48:5  They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted
 away.

PSA 48:6  Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

PSA 48:7  Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

PSA 48:8  As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts,
 in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.

PSA 48:9  We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy
 temple.

PSA 48:10  According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the
 earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

PSA 48:11  Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because
 of thy judgments.

PSA 48:12  Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.

PSA 48:13  Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it
 to the generation following.

PSA 48:14  For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even
 unto death.

PSA 49:1  Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:

PSA 49:2  Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

PSA 49:3  My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall
 be of understanding.

PSA 49:4  I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon
 the harp.

PSA 49:5  Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my
 heels shall compass me about?

PSA 49:6  They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
 multitude of their riches;

PSA 49:7  None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a
 ransom for him:

PSA 49:8  (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for
 ever:)

PSA 49:9  That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

PSA 49:10  For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish
 person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

PSA 49:11  Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
 ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands
 after their own names.

PSA 49:12  Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts
 that perish.

PSA 49:13  This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their
 sayings. Selah.

PSA 49:14  Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and
 the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty
 shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.

PSA 49:15  But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he
 shall receive me. Selah.

PSA 49:16  Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his
 house is increased;

PSA 49:17  For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not
 descend after him.

PSA 49:18  Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee,
 when thou doest well to thyself.

PSA 49:19  He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see
 light.

PSA 49:20  Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts
 that perish.

PSA 50:1  The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from
 the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

PSA 50:2  Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

PSA 50:3  Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour
 before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.

PSA 50:4  He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he
 may judge his people.

PSA 50:5  Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant
 with me by sacrifice.

PSA 50:6  And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge
 himself. Selah.

PSA 50:7  Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify
 against thee: I am God, even thy God.

PSA 50:8  I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to
 have been continually before me.

PSA 50:9  I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy
 folds.

PSA 50:10  For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
 thousand hills.

PSA 50:11  I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the
 field are mine.

PSA 50:12  If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and
 the fulness thereof.

PSA 50:13  Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

PSA 50:14  Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:

PSA 50:15  And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and
 thou shalt glorify me.

PSA 50:16  But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my
 statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?

PSA 50:17  Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee.

PSA 50:18  When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast
 been partaker with adulterers.

PSA 50:19  Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

PSA 50:20  Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine
 own mother's son.

PSA 50:21  These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
 that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
 set them in order before thine eyes.

PSA 50:22  Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces,
 and there be none to deliver.

PSA 50:23  Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his
 conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

PSA 51:1  Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according
 unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.

PSA 51:2  Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

PSA 51:3  For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.

PSA 51:4  Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
 sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when
 thou judgest.

PSA 51:5  Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive
 me.

PSA 51:6  Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden
 part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

PSA 51:7  Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be
 whiter than snow.

PSA 51:8  Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast
 broken may rejoice.

PSA 51:9  Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

PSA 51:10  Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
 me.

PSA 51:11  Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit
 from me.

PSA 51:12  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
 free spirit.

PSA 51:13  Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
 converted unto thee.

PSA 51:14  Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation:
 and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.

PSA 51:15  O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.

PSA 51:16  For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
 delightest not in burnt offering.

PSA 51:17  The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite
 heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

PSA 51:18  Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of
 Jerusalem.

PSA 51:19  Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
 with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks
 upon thine altar.

PSA 52:1  Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of
 God endureth continually.

PSA 52:2  The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
 deceitfully.

PSA 52:3  Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak
 righteousness. Selah.

PSA 52:4  Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

PSA 52:5  God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
 away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land
 of the living. Selah.

PSA 52:6  The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:

PSA 52:7  Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted
 in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.

PSA 52:8  But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the
 mercy of God for ever and ever.

PSA 52:9  I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will
 wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.

PSA 53:1  The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
 they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.

PSA 53:2  God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there
 were any that did understand, that did seek God.

PSA 53:3  Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy;
 there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

PSA 53:4  Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as
 they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

PSA 53:5  There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
 scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to
 shame, because God hath despised them.

PSA 53:6  Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God
 bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel
 shall be glad.

PSA 54:1  Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

PSA 54:2  Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

PSA 54:3  For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my
 soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

PSA 54:4  Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my
 soul.

PSA 54:5  He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.

PSA 54:6  I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD;
 for it is good.

PSA 54:7  For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen
 his desire upon mine enemies.

PSA 55:1  Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
 supplication.

PSA 55:2  Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a
 noise;

PSA 55:3  Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the
 wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.

PSA 55:4  My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are
 fallen upon me.

PSA 55:5  Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
 overwhelmed me.

PSA 55:6  And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly
 away, and be at rest.

PSA 55:7  Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.

PSA 55:8  I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

PSA 55:9  Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence
 and strife in the city.

PSA 55:10  Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also
 and sorrow are in the midst of it.

PSA 55:11  Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from
 her streets.

PSA 55:12  For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne
 it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then
 I would have hid myself from him:

PSA 55:13  But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.

PSA 55:14  We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in
 company.

PSA 55:15  Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
 wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

PSA 55:16  As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

PSA 55:17  Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and
 he shall hear my voice.

PSA 55:18  He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against
 me: for there were many with me.

PSA 55:19  God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
 Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.

PSA 55:20  He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he
 hath broken his covenant.

PSA 55:21  The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his
 heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.

PSA 55:22  Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall
 never suffer the righteous to be moved.

PSA 55:23  But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
 bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust
 in thee.

PSA 56:1  Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting
 daily oppresseth me.

PSA 56:2  Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight
 against me, O thou most High.

PSA 56:3  What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

PSA 56:4  In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not
 fear what flesh can do unto me.

PSA 56:5  Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for
 evil.

PSA 56:6  They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my
 steps, when they wait for my soul.

PSA 56:7  Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O
 God.

PSA 56:8  Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are
 they not in thy book?

PSA 56:9  When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know;
 for God is for me.

PSA 56:10  In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.

PSA 56:11  In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do
 unto me.

PSA 56:12  Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

PSA 56:13  For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my
 feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?

PSA 57:1  Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth
 in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these
 calamities be overpast.

PSA 57:2  I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things
 for me.

PSA 57:3  He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that
 would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.

PSA 57:4  My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on
 fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their
 tongue a sharp sword.

PSA 57:5  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all
 the earth.

PSA 57:6  They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they
 have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen
 themselves. Selah.

PSA 57:7  My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give
 praise.

PSA 57:8  Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake
 early.

PSA 57:9  I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee
 among the nations.

PSA 57:10  For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the
 clouds.

PSA 57:11  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above
 all the earth.

PSA 58:1  Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
 uprightly, O ye sons of men?

PSA 58:2  Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands
 in the earth.

PSA 58:3  The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as
 they be born, speaking lies.

PSA 58:4  Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf
 adder that stoppeth her ear;

PSA 58:5  Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so
 wisely.

PSA 58:6  Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth
 of the young lions, O LORD.

PSA 58:7  Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth
 his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.

PSA 58:8  As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the
 untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.

PSA 58:9  Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with
 a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

PSA 58:10  The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall
 wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

PSA 58:11  So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous:
 verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

PSA 59:1  Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise
 up against me.

PSA 59:2  Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.

PSA 59:3  For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered
 against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

PSA 59:4  They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help
 me, and behold.

PSA 59:5  Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to
 visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.

PSA 59:6  They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round
 about the city.

PSA 59:7  Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips:
 for who, say they, doth hear?

PSA 59:8  But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
 heathen in derision.

PSA 59:9  Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.

PSA 59:10  The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire
 upon mine enemies.

PSA 59:11  Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and
 bring them down, O Lord our shield.

PSA 59:12  For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even
 be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.

PSA 59:13  Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let
 them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.

PSA 59:14  And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a
 dog, and go round about the city.

PSA 59:15  Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not
 satisfied.

PSA 59:16  But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy
 in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
 trouble.

PSA 59:17  Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and
 the God of my mercy.

PSA 60:1  O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been
 displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

PSA 60:2  Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the
 breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

PSA 60:3  Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink
 the wine of astonishment.

PSA 60:4  Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
 displayed because of the truth. Selah.

PSA 60:5  That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear
 me.

PSA 60:6  God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
 Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

PSA 60:7  Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of
 mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

PSA 60:8  Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia,
 triumph thou because of me.

PSA 60:9  Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?

PSA 60:10  Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God,
 which didst not go out with our armies?

PSA 60:11  Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

PSA 60:12  Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread
 down our enemies.

PSA 61:1  Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

PSA 61:2  From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
 overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

PSA 61:3  For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the
 enemy.

PSA 61:4  I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert
 of thy wings. Selah.

PSA 61:5  For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage
 of those that fear thy name.

PSA 61:6  Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.

PSA 61:7  He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which
 may preserve him.

PSA 61:8  So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
 perform my vows.

PSA 62:1  Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.

PSA 62:2  He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be
 greatly moved.

PSA 62:3  How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain
 all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.

PSA 62:4  They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight
 in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.

PSA 62:5  My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.

PSA 62:6  He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be
 moved.

PSA 62:7  In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my
 refuge, is in God.

PSA 62:8  Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him:
 God is a refuge for us. Selah.

PSA 62:9  Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a
 lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.

PSA 62:10  Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches
 increase, set not your heart upon them.

PSA 62:11  God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth
 unto God.

PSA 62:12  Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every
 man according to his work.

PSA 63:1  O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for
 thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;

PSA 63:2  To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
 sanctuary.

PSA 63:3  Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise
 thee.

PSA 63:4  Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy
 name.

PSA 63:5  My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth
 shall praise thee with joyful lips:

PSA 63:6  When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night
 watches.

PSA 63:7  Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings
 will I rejoice.

PSA 63:8  My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.

PSA 63:9  But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower
 parts of the earth.

PSA 63:10  They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.

PSA 63:11  But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him
 shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.

PSA 64:1  Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the
 enemy.

PSA 64:2  Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection
 of the workers of iniquity:

PSA 64:3  Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot
 their arrows, even bitter words:

PSA 64:4  That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot
 at him, and fear not.

PSA 64:5  They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying
 snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

PSA 64:6  They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both
 the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.

PSA 64:7  But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be
 wounded.

PSA 64:8  So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that
 see them shall flee away.

PSA 64:9  And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they
 shall wisely consider of his doing.

PSA 64:10  The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and
 all the upright in heart shall glory.

PSA 65:1  Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow
 be performed.

PSA 65:2  O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

PSA 65:3  Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt
 purge them away.

PSA 65:4  Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto
 thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the
 goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.

PSA 65:5  By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our
 salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them
 that are afar off upon the sea:

PSA 65:6  Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with
 power:

PSA 65:7  Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and
 the tumult of the people.

PSA 65:8  They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens:
 thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.

PSA 65:9  Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it
 with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when
 thou hast so provided for it.

PSA 65:10  Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
 furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the
 springing thereof.

PSA 65:11  Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
 fatness.

PSA 65:12  They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills
 rejoice on every side.

PSA 65:13  The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered
 over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

PSA 66:1  Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

PSA 66:2  Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

PSA 66:3  Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
 greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.

PSA 66:4  All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they
 shall sing to thy name. Selah.

PSA 66:5  Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the
 children of men.

PSA 66:6  He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot:
 there did we rejoice in him.

PSA 66:7  He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not
 the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

PSA 66:8  O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be
 heard:

PSA 66:9  Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be
 moved.

PSA 66:10  For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is
 tried.

PSA 66:11  Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our
 loins.

PSA 66:12  Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire
 and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.

PSA 66:13  I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my
 vows,

PSA 66:14  Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in
 trouble.

PSA 66:15  I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
 incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

PSA 66:16  Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath
 done for my soul.

PSA 66:17  I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.

PSA 66:18  If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

PSA 66:19  But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my
 prayer.

PSA 66:20  Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy
 from me.

PSA 67:1  God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine
 upon us; Selah.

PSA 67:2  That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all
 nations.

PSA 67:3  Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.

PSA 67:4  O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the
 people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.

PSA 67:5  Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.

PSA 67:6  Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God,
 shall bless us.

PSA 67:7  God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.

PSA 68:1  Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate
 him flee before him.

PSA 68:2  As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before
 the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.

PSA 68:3  But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let
 them exceedingly rejoice.

PSA 68:4  Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon
 the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

PSA 68:5  A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his
 holy habitation.

PSA 68:6  God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are
 bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.

PSA 68:7  O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst
 march through the wilderness; Selah:

PSA 68:8  The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God:
 even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

PSA 68:9  Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm
 thine inheritance, when it was weary.

PSA 68:10  Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of
 thy goodness for the poor.

PSA 68:11  The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that
 published it.

PSA 68:12  Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided
 the spoil.

PSA 68:13  Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of
 a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.

PSA 68:14  When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in
 Salmon.

PSA 68:15  The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill
 of Bashan.

PSA 68:16  Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to
 dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.

PSA 68:17  The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels:
 the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.

PSA 68:18  Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou
 hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God
 might dwell among them.

PSA 68:19  Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the
 God of our salvation. Selah.

PSA 68:20  He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord
 belong the issues from death.

PSA 68:21  But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of
 such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

PSA 68:22  The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
 people again from the depths of the sea:

PSA 68:23  That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the
 tongue of thy dogs in the same.

PSA 68:24  They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my
 King, in the sanctuary.

PSA 68:25  The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after;
 among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.

PSA 68:26  Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain
 of Israel.

PSA 68:27  There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and
 their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.

PSA 68:28  Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which
 thou hast wrought for us.

PSA 68:29  Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto
 thee.

PSA 68:30  Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the
 calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver:
 scatter thou the people that delight in war.

PSA 68:31  Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her
 hands unto God.

PSA 68:32  Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the
 Lord; Selah:

PSA 68:33  To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old;
 lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

PSA 68:34  Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his
 strength is in the clouds.

PSA 68:35  O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel
 is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.

PSA 69:1  Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.

PSA 69:2  I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep
 waters, where the floods overflow me.

PSA 69:3  I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I
 wait for my God.

PSA 69:4  They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine
 head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty:
 then I restored that which I took not away.

PSA 69:5  O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from
 thee.

PSA 69:6  Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for
 my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of
 Israel.

PSA 69:7  Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my
 face.

PSA 69:8  I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
 mother's children.

PSA 69:9  For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches
 of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

PSA 69:10  When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my
 reproach.

PSA 69:11  I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.

PSA 69:12  They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
 of the drunkards.

PSA 69:13  But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable
 time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy
 salvation.

PSA 69:14  Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered
 from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

PSA 69:15  Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me
 up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

PSA 69:16  Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
 according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

PSA 69:17  And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me
 speedily.

PSA 69:18  Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine
 enemies.

PSA 69:19  Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine
 adversaries are all before thee.

PSA 69:20  Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I
 looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I
 found none.

PSA 69:21  They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me
 vinegar to drink.

PSA 69:22  Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should
 have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

PSA 69:23  Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins
 continually to shake.

PSA 69:24  Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger
 take hold of them.

PSA 69:25  Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.

PSA 69:26  For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the
 grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

PSA 69:27  Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy
 righteousness.

PSA 69:28  Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
 written with the righteous.

PSA 69:29  But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on
 high.

PSA 69:30  I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with
 thanksgiving.

PSA 69:31  This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that
 hath horns and hoofs.

PSA 69:32  The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live
 that seek God.

PSA 69:33  For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.

PSA 69:34  Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that
 moveth therein.

PSA 69:35  For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that
 they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

PSA 69:36  The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love
 his name shall dwell therein.

PSA 70:1  MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.

PSA 70:2  Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them
 be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

PSA 70:3  Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha,
 aha.

PSA 70:4  Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let
 such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

PSA 70:5  But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help
 and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

PSA 71:1  In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.

PSA 71:2  Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline
 thine ear unto me, and save me.

PSA 71:3  Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
 thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.

PSA 71:4  Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand
 of the unrighteous and cruel man.

PSA 71:5  For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.

PSA 71:6  By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me
 out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.

PSA 71:7  I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.

PSA 71:8  Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the
 day.

PSA 71:9  Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
 strength faileth.

PSA 71:10  For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my
 soul take counsel together,

PSA 71:11  Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is
 none to deliver him.

PSA 71:12  O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

PSA 71:13  Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul;
 let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.

PSA 71:14  But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.

PSA 71:15  My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all
 the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.

PSA 71:16  I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of
 thy righteousness, even of thine only.

PSA 71:17  O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
 declared thy wondrous works.

PSA 71:18  Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until
 I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one
 that is to come.

PSA 71:19  Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great
 things: O God, who is like unto thee!

PSA 71:20  Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me
 again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

PSA 71:21  Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.

PSA 71:22  I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God:
 unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.

PSA 71:23  My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul,
 which thou hast redeemed.

PSA 71:24  My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for
 they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.

PSA 72:1  Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the
 king's son.

PSA 72:2  He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with
 judgment.

PSA 72:3  The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills,
 by righteousness.

PSA 72:4  He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children
 of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.

PSA 72:5  They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout
 all generations.

PSA 72:6  He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that
 water the earth.

PSA 72:7  In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so
 long as the moon endureth.

PSA 72:8  He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto
 the ends of the earth.

PSA 72:9  They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his
 enemies shall lick the dust.

PSA 72:10  The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the
 kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

PSA 72:11  Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve
 him.

PSA 72:12  For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and
 him that hath no helper.

PSA 72:13  He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the
 needy.

PSA 72:14  He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious
 shall their blood be in his sight.

PSA 72:15  And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba:
 prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.

PSA 72:16  There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the
 mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city
 shall flourish like grass of the earth.

PSA 72:17  His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long
 as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him
 blessed.

PSA 72:18  Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous
 things.

PSA 72:19  And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth
 be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

PSA 72:20  The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

PSA 73:1  Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.

PSA 73:2  But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh
 slipped.

PSA 73:3  For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the
 wicked.

PSA 73:4  For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.

PSA 73:5  They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like
 other men.

PSA 73:6  Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth
 them as a garment.

PSA 73:7  Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could
 wish.

PSA 73:8  They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they
 speak loftily.

PSA 73:9  They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh
 through the earth.

PSA 73:10  Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are
 wrung out to them.

PSA 73:11  And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most
 High?

PSA 73:12  Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
 increase in riches.

PSA 73:13  Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in
 innocency.

PSA 73:14  For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
 morning.

PSA 73:15  If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the
 generation of thy children.

PSA 73:16  When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

PSA 73:17  Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.

PSA 73:18  Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them
 down into destruction.

PSA 73:19  How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
 utterly consumed with terrors.

PSA 73:20  As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou
 shalt despise their image.

PSA 73:21  Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

PSA 73:22  So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.

PSA 73:23  Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my
 right hand.

PSA 73:24  Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to
 glory.

PSA 73:25  Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I
 desire beside thee.

PSA 73:26  My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
 heart, and my portion for ever.

PSA 73:27  For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
 destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

PSA 73:28  But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
 in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

PSA 74:1  O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke
 against the sheep of thy pasture?

PSA 74:2  Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod
 of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou
 hast dwelt.

PSA 74:3  Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the
 enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

PSA 74:4  Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up
 their ensigns for signs.

PSA 74:5  A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick
 trees.

PSA 74:6  But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and
 hammers.

PSA 74:7  They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting
 down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

PSA 74:8  They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have
 burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

PSA 74:9  We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there
 among us any that knoweth how long.

PSA 74:10  O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
 blaspheme thy name for ever?

PSA 74:11  Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of
 thy bosom.

PSA 74:12  For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the
 earth.

PSA 74:13  Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads
 of the dragons in the waters.

PSA 74:14  Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be
 meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

PSA 74:15  Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty
 rivers.

PSA 74:16  The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the
 light and the sun.

PSA 74:17  Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer
 and winter.

PSA 74:18  Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the
 foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

PSA 74:19  O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the
 wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

PSA 74:20  Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are
 full of the habitations of cruelty.

PSA 74:21  O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
 praise thy name.

PSA 74:22  Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
 reproacheth thee daily.

PSA 74:23  Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise
 up against thee increaseth continually.

PSA 75:1  Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for
 that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

PSA 75:2  When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

PSA 75:3  The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up
 the pillars of it. Selah.

PSA 75:4  I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift
 not up the horn:

PSA 75:5  Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.

PSA 75:6  For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor
 from the south.

PSA 75:7  But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.

PSA 75:8  For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it
 is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof,
 all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.

PSA 75:9  But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

PSA 75:10  All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
 of the righteous shall be exalted.

PSA 76:1  In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.

PSA 76:2  In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.

PSA 76:3  There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and
 the battle. Selah.

PSA 76:4  Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.

PSA 76:5  The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none
 of the men of might have found their hands.

PSA 76:6  At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast
 into a dead sleep.

PSA 76:7  Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight
 when once thou art angry?

PSA 76:8  Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
 feared, and was still,

PSA 76:9  When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

PSA 76:10  Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath
 shalt thou restrain.

PSA 76:11  Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him
 bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

PSA 76:12  He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings
 of the earth.

PSA 77:1  I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he
 gave ear unto me.

PSA 77:2  In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
 night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

PSA 77:3  I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was
 overwhelmed. Selah.

PSA 77:4  Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

PSA 77:5  I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

PSA 77:6  I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own
 heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

PSA 77:7  Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?

PSA 77:8  Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?

PSA 77:9  Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his
 tender mercies? Selah.

PSA 77:10  And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years
 of the right hand of the most High.

PSA 77:11  I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy
 wonders of old.

PSA 77:12  I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

PSA 77:13  Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our
 God?

PSA 77:14  Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength
 among the people.

PSA 77:15  Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and
 Joseph. Selah.

PSA 77:16  The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid:
 the depths also were troubled.

PSA 77:17  The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine
 arrows also went abroad.

PSA 77:18  The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened
 the world: the earth trembled and shook.

PSA 77:19  Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy
 footsteps are not known.

PSA 77:20  Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

PSA 78:1  Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of
 my mouth.

PSA 78:2  I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:

PSA 78:3  Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

PSA 78:4  We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation
 to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works
 that he hath done.

PSA 78:5  For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in
 Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known
 to their children:

PSA 78:6  That the generation to come might know them, even the children which
 should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:

PSA 78:7  That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of
 God, but keep his commandments:

PSA 78:8  And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
 generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit
 was not stedfast with God.

PSA 78:9  The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back
 in the day of battle.

PSA 78:10  They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;

PSA 78:11  And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

PSA 78:12  Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land
 of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

PSA 78:13  He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the
 waters to stand as an heap.

PSA 78:14  In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with
 a light of fire.

PSA 78:15  He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out
 of the great depths.

PSA 78:16  He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run
 down like rivers.

PSA 78:17  And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High
 in the wilderness.

PSA 78:18  And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.

PSA 78:19  Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table
 in the wilderness?

PSA 78:20  Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
 streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his
 people?

PSA 78:21  Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled
 against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

PSA 78:22  Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:

PSA 78:23  Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors
 of heaven,

PSA 78:24  And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
 of the corn of heaven.

PSA 78:25  Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

PSA 78:26  He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he
 brought in the south wind.

PSA 78:27  He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as
 the sand of the sea:

PSA 78:28  And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their
 habitations.

PSA 78:29  So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own
 desire;

PSA 78:30  They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was
 yet in their mouths,

PSA 78:31  The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and
 smote down the chosen men of Israel.

PSA 78:32  For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous
 works.

PSA 78:33  Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in
 trouble.

PSA 78:34  When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
 enquired early after God.

PSA 78:35  And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their
 redeemer.

PSA 78:36  Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied
 unto him with their tongues.

PSA 78:37  For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast
 in his covenant.

PSA 78:38  But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
 destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not
 stir up all his wrath.

PSA 78:39  For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth
 away, and cometh not again.

PSA 78:40  How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
 in the desert!

PSA 78:41  Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of
 Israel.

PSA 78:42  They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them
 from the enemy.

PSA 78:43  How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field
 of Zoan.

PSA 78:44  And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they
 could not drink.

PSA 78:45  He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and
 frogs, which destroyed them.

PSA 78:46  He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour
 unto the locust.

PSA 78:47  He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with
 frost.

PSA 78:48  He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot
 thunderbolts.

PSA 78:49  He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
 indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.

PSA 78:50  He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but
 gave their life over to the pestilence;

PSA 78:51  And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength
 in the tabernacles of Ham:

PSA 78:52  But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them
 in the wilderness like a flock.

PSA 78:53  And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea
 overwhelmed their enemies.

PSA 78:54  And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this
 mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

PSA 78:55  He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
 inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

PSA 78:56  Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his
 testimonies:

PSA 78:57  But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they
 were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

PSA 78:58  For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him
 to jealousy with their graven images.

PSA 78:59  When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:

PSA 78:60  So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
 placed among men;

PSA 78:61  And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the
 enemy's hand.

PSA 78:62  He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his
 inheritance.

PSA 78:63  The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given
 to marriage.

PSA 78:64  Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
 lamentation.

PSA 78:65  Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that
 shouteth by reason of wine.

PSA 78:66  And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
 perpetual reproach.

PSA 78:67  Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
 tribe of Ephraim:

PSA 78:68  But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

PSA 78:69  And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which
 he hath established for ever.

PSA 78:70  He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:

PSA 78:71  From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed
 Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

PSA 78:72  So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided
 them by the skilfulness of his hands.

PSA 79:1  O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple
 have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

PSA 79:2  The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the
 fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.

PSA 79:3  Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and
 there was none to bury them.

PSA 79:4  We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision
 to them that are round about us.

PSA 79:5  How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn
 like fire?

PSA 79:6  Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and
 upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

PSA 79:7  For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.

PSA 79:8  O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies
 speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

PSA 79:9  Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and
 deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.

PSA 79:10  Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be
 known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy
 servants which is shed.

PSA 79:11  Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the
 greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;

PSA 79:12  And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their
 reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

PSA 79:13  So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for
 ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.

PSA 80:1  Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a
 flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.

PSA 80:2  Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and
 come and save us.

PSA 80:3  Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be
 saved.

PSA 80:4  O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer
 of thy people?

PSA 80:5  Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to
 drink in great measure.

PSA 80:6  Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh
 among themselves.

PSA 80:7  Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we
 shall be saved.

PSA 80:8  Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
 heathen, and planted it.

PSA 80:9  Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep
 root, and it filled the land.

PSA 80:10  The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof
 were like the goodly cedars.

PSA 80:11  She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the
 river.

PSA 80:12  Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which
 pass by the way do pluck her?

PSA 80:13  The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the
 field doth devour it.

PSA 80:14  Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and
 behold, and visit this vine;

PSA 80:15  And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch
 that thou madest strong for thyself.

PSA 80:16  It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of
 thy countenance.

PSA 80:17  Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man
 whom thou madest strong for thyself.

PSA 80:18  So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon
 thy name.

PSA 80:19  Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we
 shall be saved.

PSA 81:1  Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of
 Jacob.

PSA 81:2  Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with
 the psaltery.

PSA 81:3  Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our
 solemn feast day.

PSA 81:4  For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.

PSA 81:5  This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through
 the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.

PSA 81:6  I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from
 the pots.

PSA 81:7  Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee
 in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah.
 Selah.

PSA 81:8  Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou
 wilt hearken unto me;

PSA 81:9  There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any
 strange god.

PSA 81:10  I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt:
 open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

PSA 81:11  But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none
 of me.

PSA 81:12  So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked
 in their own counsels.

PSA 81:13  Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my
 ways!

PSA 81:14  I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against
 their adversaries.

PSA 81:15  The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him:
 but their time should have endured for ever.

PSA 81:16  He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with
 honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

PSA 82:1  God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the
 gods.

PSA 82:2  How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
 wicked? Selah.

PSA 82:3  Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and
 needy.

PSA 82:4  Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.

PSA 82:5  They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
 darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

PSA 82:6  I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most
 High.

PSA 82:7  But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

PSA 82:8  Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.

PSA 83:1  Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O
 God.

PSA 83:2  For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have
 lifted up the head.

PSA 83:3  They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted
 against thy hidden ones.

PSA 83:4  They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;
 that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

PSA 83:5  For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
 confederate against thee:

PSA 83:6  The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
 Hagarenes;

PSA 83:7  Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of
 Tyre;

PSA 83:8  Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot.
 Selah.

PSA 83:9  Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at
 the brook of Kison:

PSA 83:10  Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.

PSA 83:11  Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes
 as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

PSA 83:12  Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.

PSA 83:13  O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.

PSA 83:14  As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains
 on fire;

PSA 83:15  So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy
 storm.

PSA 83:16  Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.

PSA 83:17  Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put
 to shame, and perish:

PSA 83:18  That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the
 most high over all the earth.

PSA 84:1  How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

PSA 84:2  My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my
 heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

PSA 84:3  Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for
 herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my
 King, and my God.

PSA 84:4  Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising
 thee. Selah.

PSA 84:5  Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the
 ways of them.

PSA 84:6  Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also
 filleth the pools.

PSA 84:7  They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
 appeareth before God.

PSA 84:8  O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

PSA 84:9  Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.

PSA 84:10  For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a
 doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

PSA 84:11  For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and
 glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.

PSA 84:12  O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

PSA 85:1  Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back
 the captivity of Jacob.

PSA 85:2  Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all
 their sin. Selah.

PSA 85:3  Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the
 fierceness of thine anger.

PSA 85:4  Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to
 cease.

PSA 85:5  Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger
 to all generations?

PSA 85:6  Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?

PSA 85:7  Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

PSA 85:8  I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace
 unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.

PSA 85:9  Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell
 in our land.

PSA 85:10  Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
 kissed each other.

PSA 85:11  Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look
 down from heaven.

PSA 85:12  Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall
 yield her increase.

PSA 85:13  Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of
 his steps.

PSA 86:1  Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

PSA 86:2  Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that
 trusteth in thee.

PSA 86:3  Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

PSA 86:4  Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up
 my soul.

PSA 86:5  For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in
 mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

PSA 86:6  Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my
 supplications.

PSA 86:7  In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer
 me.

PSA 86:8  Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are
 there any works like unto thy works.

PSA 86:9  All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O
 Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

PSA 86:10  For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.

PSA 86:11  Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart
 to fear thy name.

PSA 86:12  I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will
 glorify thy name for evermore.

PSA 86:13  For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul
 from the lowest hell.

PSA 86:14  O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent
 men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.

PSA 86:15  But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, long
 suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

PSA 86:16  O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy
 servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

PSA 86:17  Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be
 ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.

PSA 87:1  His foundation is in the holy mountains.

PSA 87:2  The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
 Jacob.

PSA 87:3  Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

PSA 87:4  I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold
 Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.

PSA 87:5  And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and
 the highest himself shall establish her.

PSA 87:6  The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man
 was born there. Selah.

PSA 87:7  As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all
 my springs are in thee.

PSA 88:1  O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:

PSA 88:2  Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;

PSA 88:3  For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the
 grave.

PSA 88:4  I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that
 hath no strength:

PSA 88:5  Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou
 rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.

PSA 88:6  Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.

PSA 88:7  Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy
 waves. Selah.

PSA 88:8  Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me
 an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.

PSA 88:9  Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily
 upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

PSA 88:10  Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise
 thee? Selah.

PSA 88:11  Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
 faithfulness in destruction?

PSA 88:12  Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the
 land of forgetfulness?

PSA 88:13  But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my
 prayer prevent thee.

PSA 88:14  LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from
 me?

PSA 88:15  I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy
 terrors I am distracted.

PSA 88:16  Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

PSA 88:17  They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about
 together.

PSA 88:18  Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance
 into darkness.

PSA 89:1  I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I
 make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

PSA 89:2  For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness
 shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

PSA 89:3  I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my
 servant,

PSA 89:4  Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all
 generations. Selah.

PSA 89:5  And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness
 also in the congregation of the saints.

PSA 89:6  For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the
 sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

PSA 89:7  God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be
 had in reverence of all them that are about him.

PSA 89:8  O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy
 faithfulness round about thee?

PSA 89:9  Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou
 stillest them.

PSA 89:10  Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast
 scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.

PSA 89:11  The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and
 the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

PSA 89:12  The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon
 shall rejoice in thy name.

PSA 89:13  Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right
 hand.

PSA 89:14  Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and
 truth shall go before thy face.

PSA 89:15  Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O
 LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

PSA 89:16  In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness
 shall they be exalted.

PSA 89:17  For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn
 shall be exalted.

PSA 89:18  For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.

PSA 89:19  Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid
 help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.

PSA 89:20  I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:

PSA 89:21  With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
 strengthen him.

PSA 89:22  The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
 afflict him.

PSA 89:23  And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that
 hate him.

PSA 89:24  But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name
 shall his horn be exalted.

PSA 89:25  I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
 rivers.

PSA 89:26  He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my
 salvation.

PSA 89:27  Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the
 earth.

PSA 89:28  My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall
 stand fast with him.

PSA 89:29  His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the
 days of heaven.

PSA 89:30  If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

PSA 89:31  If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

PSA 89:32  Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
 iniquity with stripes.

PSA 89:33  Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor
 suffer my faithfulness to fail.

PSA 89:34  My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out
 of my lips.

PSA 89:35  Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.

PSA 89:36  His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.

PSA 89:37  It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful
 witness in heaven. Selah.

PSA 89:38  But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine
 anointed.

PSA 89:39  Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned
 his crown by casting it to the ground.

PSA 89:40  Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong
 holds to ruin.

PSA 89:41  All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
 neighbours.

PSA 89:42  Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made
 all his enemies to rejoice.

PSA 89:43  Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him
 to stand in the battle.

PSA 89:44  Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the
 ground.

PSA 89:45  The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him
 with shame. Selah.

PSA 89:46  How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath
 burn like fire?

PSA 89:47  Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in
 vain?

PSA 89:48  What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
 deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

PSA 89:49  Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto
 David in thy truth?

PSA 89:50  Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my
 bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

PSA 89:51  Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have
 reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

PSA 89:52  Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

PSA 90:1  Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

PSA 90:2  Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed
 the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.

PSA 90:3  Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of
 men.

PSA 90:4  For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
 past, and as a watch in the night.

PSA 90:5  Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the
 morning they are like grass which groweth up.

PSA 90:6  In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is
 cut down, and withereth.

PSA 90:7  For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.

PSA 90:8  Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the
 light of thy countenance.

PSA 90:9  For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as
 a tale that is told.

PSA 90:10  The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason
 of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow;
 for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

PSA 90:11  Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so
 is thy wrath.

PSA 90:12  So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto
 wisdom.

PSA 90:13  Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy
 servants.

PSA 90:14  O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad
 all our days.

PSA 90:15  Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,
 and the years wherein we have seen evil.

PSA 90:16  Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their
 children.

PSA 90:17  And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish
 thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou
 it.

PSA 91:1  He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
 under the shadow of the Almighty.

PSA 91:2  I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in
 him will I trust.

PSA 91:3  Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from
 the noisome pestilence.

PSA 91:4  He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou
 trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

PSA 91:5  Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow
 that flieth by day;

PSA 91:6  Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
 destruction that wasteth at noonday.

PSA 91:7  A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right
 hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

PSA 91:8  Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
 wicked.

PSA 91:9  Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most
 High, thy habitation;

PSA 91:10  There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh
 thy dwelling.

PSA 91:11  For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all
 thy ways.

PSA 91:12  They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
 against a stone.

PSA 91:13  Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
 dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

PSA 91:14  Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
 I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

PSA 91:15  He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in
 trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

PSA 91:16  With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

PSA 92:1  IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES
 UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:

PSA 92:2  To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness
 every night,

PSA 92:3  Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the
 harp with a solemn sound.

PSA 92:4  For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph
 in the works of thy hands.

PSA 92:5  O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.

PSA 92:6  A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.

PSA 92:7  When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of
 iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:

PSA 92:8  But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.

PSA 92:9  For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish;
 all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

PSA 92:10  But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be
 anointed with fresh oil.

PSA 92:11  Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears
 shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.

PSA 92:12  The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like
 a cedar in Lebanon.

PSA 92:13  Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the
 courts of our God.

PSA 92:14  They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and
 flourishing;

PSA 92:15  To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no
 unrighteousness in him.

PSA 93:1  The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed
 with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is
 stablished, that it cannot be moved.

PSA 93:2  Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.

PSA 93:3  The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their
 voice; the floods lift up their waves.

PSA 93:4  The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than
 the mighty waves of the sea.

PSA 93:5  Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD,
 for ever.

PSA 94:1  O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance
 belongeth, shew thyself.

PSA 94:2  Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the
 proud.

PSA 94:3  LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?

PSA 94:4  How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers
 of iniquity boast themselves?

PSA 94:5  They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.

PSA 94:6  They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.

PSA 94:7  Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob
 regard it.

PSA 94:8  Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye
 be wise?

PSA 94:9  He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye,
 shall he not see?

PSA 94:10  He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
 teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?

PSA 94:11  The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

PSA 94:12  Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him
 out of thy law;

PSA 94:13  That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the
 pit be digged for the wicked.

PSA 94:14  For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake
 his inheritance.

PSA 94:15  But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in
 heart shall follow it.

PSA 94:16  Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up
 for me against the workers of iniquity?

PSA 94:17  Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
 silence.

PSA 94:18  When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.

PSA 94:19  In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my
 soul.

PSA 94:20  Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
 frameth mischief by a law?

PSA 94:21  They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
 and condemn the innocent blood.

PSA 94:22  But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.

PSA 94:23  And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them
 off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.

PSA 95:1  O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the
 rock of our salvation.

PSA 95:2  Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful
 noise unto him with psalms.

PSA 95:3  For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

PSA 95:4  In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the
 hills is his also.

PSA 95:5  The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.

PSA 95:6  O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our
 maker.

PSA 95:7  For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the
 sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

PSA 95:8  Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of
 temptation in the wilderness:

PSA 95:9  When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

PSA 95:10  Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is
 a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:

PSA 95:11  Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my
 rest.

PSA 96:1  O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.

PSA 96:2  Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day
 to day.

PSA 96:3  Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.

PSA 96:4  For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared
 above all gods.

PSA 96:5  For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the
 heavens.

PSA 96:6  Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his
 sanctuary.

PSA 96:7  Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD
 glory and strength.

PSA 96:8  Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
 offering, and come into his courts.

PSA 96:9  O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all
 the earth.

PSA 96:10  Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall
 be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people
 righteously.

PSA 96:11  Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea
 roar, and the fulness thereof.

PSA 96:12  Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the
 trees of the wood rejoice

PSA 96:13  Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he
 shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.

PSA 97:1  The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles
 be glad thereof.

PSA 97:2  Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment
 are the habitation of his throne.

PSA 97:3  A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.

PSA 97:4  His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.

PSA 97:5  The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
 presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

PSA 97:6  The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his
 glory.

PSA 97:7  Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
 themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.

PSA 97:8  Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because
 of thy judgments, O LORD.

PSA 97:9  For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far
 above all gods.

PSA 97:10  Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his
 saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

PSA 97:11  Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
 heart.

PSA 97:12  Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
 remembrance of his holiness.

PSA 98:1  O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things:
 his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.

PSA 98:2  The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he
 openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

PSA 98:3  He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
 Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

PSA 98:4  Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
 noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

PSA 98:5  Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a
 psalm.

PSA 98:6  With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the
 LORD, the King.

PSA 98:7  Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that
 dwell therein.

PSA 98:8  Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together

PSA 98:9  Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness
 shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.

PSA 99:1  The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the
 cherubims; let the earth be moved.

PSA 99:2  The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.

PSA 99:3  Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

PSA 99:4  The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity,
 thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

PSA 99:5  Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is
 holy.

PSA 99:6  Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call
 upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.

PSA 99:7  He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies,
 and the ordinance that he gave them.

PSA 99:8  Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest
 them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.

PSA 99:9  Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD
 our God is holy.

PSA 100:1  Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

PSA 100:2  Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.

PSA 100:3  Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not
 we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

PSA 100:4  Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
 praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

PSA 100:5  For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
 endureth to all generations.

PSA 101:1  I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.

PSA 101:2  I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come
 unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.

PSA 101:3  I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them
 that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

PSA 101:4  A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
 person.

PSA 101:5  Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that
 hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.

PSA 101:6  Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may
 dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.

PSA 101:7  He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that
 telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

PSA 101:8  I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off
 all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

PSA 102:1  Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

PSA 102:2  Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline
 thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.

PSA 102:3  For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an
 hearth.

PSA 102:4  My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to
 eat my bread.

PSA 102:5  By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.

PSA 102:6  I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
 desert.

PSA 102:7  I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

PSA 102:8  Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against
 me are sworn against me.

PSA 102:9  For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
 weeping.

PSA 102:10  Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me
 up, and cast me down.

PSA 102:11  My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like
 grass.

PSA 102:12  But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto
 all generations.

PSA 102:13  Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour
 her, yea, the set time, is come.

PSA 102:14  For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust
 thereof.

PSA 102:15  So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings
 of the earth thy glory.

PSA 102:16  When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.

PSA 102:17  He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their
 prayer.

PSA 102:18  This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people
 which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

PSA 102:19  For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
 heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

PSA 102:20  To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
 appointed to death;

PSA 102:21  To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
 Jerusalem;

PSA 102:22  When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve
 the LORD.

PSA 102:23  He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

PSA 102:24  I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy
 years are throughout all generations.

PSA 102:25  Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens
 are the work of thy hands.

PSA 102:26  They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall
 wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall
 be changed:

PSA 102:27  But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

PSA 102:28  The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall
 be established before thee.

PSA 103:1  Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy
 name.

PSA 103:2  Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

PSA 103:3  Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;

PSA 103:4  Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with
 lovingkindness and tender mercies;

PSA 103:5  Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is
 renewed like the eagle's.

PSA 103:6  The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
 oppressed.

PSA 103:7  He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of
 Israel.

PSA 103:8  The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in
 mercy.

PSA 103:9  He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.

PSA 103:10  He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according
 to our iniquities.

PSA 103:11  For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy
 toward them that fear him.

PSA 103:12  As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
 transgressions from us.

PSA 103:13  Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them
 that fear him.

PSA 103:14  For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

PSA 103:15  As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he
 flourisheth.

PSA 103:16  For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof
 shall know it no more.

PSA 103:17  But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon
 them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;

PSA 103:18  To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
 commandments to do them.

PSA 103:19  The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom
 ruleth over all.

PSA 103:20  Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his
 commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

PSA 103:21  Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do
 his pleasure.

PSA 103:22  Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless
 the LORD, O my soul.

PSA 104:1  Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou
 art clothed with honour and majesty.

PSA 104:2  Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest
 out the heavens like a curtain:

PSA 104:3  Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the
 clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:

PSA 104:4  Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

PSA 104:5  Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed
 for ever.

PSA 104:6  Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood
 above the mountains.

PSA 104:7  At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted
 away.

PSA 104:8  They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the
 place which thou hast founded for them.

PSA 104:9  Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn
 not again to cover the earth.

PSA 104:10  He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.

PSA 104:11  They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench
 their thirst.

PSA 104:12  By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which
 sing among the branches.

PSA 104:13  He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied
 with the fruit of thy works.

PSA 104:14  He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
 service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

PSA 104:15  And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his
 face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.

PSA 104:16  The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which
 he hath planted;

PSA 104:17  Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees
 are her house.

PSA 104:18  The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for
 the conies.

PSA 104:19  He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.

PSA 104:20  Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
 of the forest do creep forth.

PSA 104:21  The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from
 God.

PSA 104:22  The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down
 in their dens.

PSA 104:23  Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.

PSA 104:24  O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them
 all: the earth is full of thy riches.

PSA 104:25  So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
 innumerable, both small and great beasts.

PSA 104:26  There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to
 play therein.

PSA 104:27  These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in
 due season.

PSA 104:28  That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they
 are filled with good.

PSA 104:29  Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their
 breath, they die, and return to their dust.

PSA 104:30  Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest
 the face of the earth.

PSA 104:31  The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice
 in his works.

PSA 104:32  He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills,
 and they smoke.

PSA 104:33  I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to
 my God while I have my being.

PSA 104:34  My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.

PSA 104:35  Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be
 no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.

PSA 105:1  O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his
 deeds among the people.

PSA 105:2  Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous
 works.

PSA 105:3  Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek
 the LORD.

PSA 105:4  Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

PSA 105:5  Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and
 the judgments of his mouth;

PSA 105:6  O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.

PSA 105:7  He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.

PSA 105:8  He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
 commanded to a thousand generations.

PSA 105:9  Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

PSA 105:10  And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an
 everlasting covenant:

PSA 105:11  Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your
 inheritance:

PSA 105:12  When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
 strangers in it.

PSA 105:13  When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
 another people;

PSA 105:14  He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for
 their sakes;

PSA 105:15  Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

PSA 105:16  Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole
 staff of bread.

PSA 105:17  He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:

PSA 105:18  Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

PSA 105:19  Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.

PSA 105:20  The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let
 him go free.

PSA 105:21  He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

PSA 105:22  To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.

PSA 105:23  Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of
 Ham.

PSA 105:24  And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than
 their enemies.

PSA 105:25  He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his
 servants.

PSA 105:26  He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

PSA 105:27  They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

PSA 105:28  He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against
 his word.

PSA 105:29  He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

PSA 105:30  Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers
 of their kings.

PSA 105:31  He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all
 their coasts.

PSA 105:32  He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

PSA 105:33  He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees
 of their coasts.

PSA 105:34  He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without
 number,

PSA 105:35  And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit
 of their ground.

PSA 105:36  He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all
 their strength.

PSA 105:37  He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not
 one feeble person among their tribes.

PSA 105:38  Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon
 them.

PSA 105:39  He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the
 night.

PSA 105:40  The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with
 the bread of heaven.

PSA 105:41  He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry
 places like a river.

PSA 105:42  For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

PSA 105:43  And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
 gladness:

PSA 105:44  And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
 labour of the people;

PSA 105:45  That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye
 the LORD.

PSA 106:1  Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for
 his mercy endureth for ever.

PSA 106:2  Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all
 his praise?

PSA 106:3  Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness
 at all times.

PSA 106:4  Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy
 people: O visit me with thy salvation;

PSA 106:5  That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the
 gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.

PSA 106:6  We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have
 done wickedly.

PSA 106:7  Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not
 the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red
 sea.

PSA 106:8  Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make
 his mighty power to be known.

PSA 106:9  He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them
 through the depths, as through the wilderness.

PSA 106:10  And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
 redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

PSA 106:11  And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them
 left.

PSA 106:12  Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

PSA 106:13  They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

PSA 106:14  But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the
 desert.

PSA 106:15  And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.

PSA 106:16  They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
 LORD.

PSA 106:17  The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of
 Abiram.

PSA 106:18  And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the
 wicked.

PSA 106:19  They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

PSA 106:20  Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that
 eateth grass.

PSA 106:21  They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
 Egypt;

PSA 106:22  Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red
 sea.

PSA 106:23  Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his
 chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should
 destroy them.

PSA 106:24  Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:

PSA 106:25  But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
 of the LORD.

PSA 106:26  Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them
 in the wilderness:

PSA 106:27  To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them
 in the lands.

PSA 106:28  They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices
 of the dead.

PSA 106:29  Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
 plague brake in upon them.

PSA 106:30  Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague
 was stayed.

PSA 106:31  And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
 generations for evermore.

PSA 106:32  They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill
 with Moses for their sakes:

PSA 106:33  Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with
 his lips.

PSA 106:34  They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
 commanded them:

PSA 106:35  But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

PSA 106:36  And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

PSA 106:37  Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,

PSA 106:38  And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their
 daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was
 polluted with blood.

PSA 106:39  Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring
 with their own inventions.

PSA 106:40  Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
 insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

PSA 106:41  And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated
 them ruled over them.

PSA 106:42  Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
 subjection under their hand.

PSA 106:43  Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their
 counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

PSA 106:44  Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:

PSA 106:45  And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according
 to the multitude of his mercies.

PSA 106:46  He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
 captives.

PSA 106:47  Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to
 give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.

PSA 106:48  Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting:
 and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.

PSA 107:1  O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth
 for ever.

PSA 107:2  Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the
 hand of the enemy;

PSA 107:3  And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the
 west, from the north, and from the south.

PSA 107:4  They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no
 city to dwell in.

PSA 107:5  Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

PSA 107:6  Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered
 them out of their distresses.

PSA 107:7  And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city
 of habitation.

PSA 107:8  Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
 wonderful works to the children of men!

PSA 107:9  For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with
 goodness.

PSA 107:10  Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in
 affliction and iron;

PSA 107:11  Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the
 counsel of the most High:

PSA 107:12  Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
 down, and there was none to help.

PSA 107:13  Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them
 out of their distresses.

PSA 107:14  He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake
 their bands in sunder.

PSA 107:15  Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
 wonderful works to the children of men!

PSA 107:16  For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in
 sunder.

PSA 107:17  Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
 iniquities, are afflicted.

PSA 107:18  Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto
 the gates of death.

PSA 107:19  Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them
 out of their distresses.

PSA 107:20  He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their
 destructions.

PSA 107:21  Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
 wonderful works to the children of men!

PSA 107:22  And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare
 his works with rejoicing.

PSA 107:23  They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great
 waters;

PSA 107:24  These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

PSA 107:25  For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up
 the waves thereof.

PSA 107:26  They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
 their soul is melted because of trouble.

PSA 107:27  They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at
 their wit's end.

PSA 107:28  Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them
 out of their distresses.

PSA 107:29  He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.

PSA 107:30  Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto
 their desired haven.

PSA 107:31  Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
 wonderful works to the children of men!

PSA 107:32  Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
 praise him in the assembly of the elders.

PSA 107:33  He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry
 ground;

PSA 107:34  A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that
 dwell therein.

PSA 107:35  He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground
 into watersprings.

PSA 107:36  And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a
 city for habitation;

PSA 107:37  And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of
 increase.

PSA 107:38  He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and
 suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

PSA 107:39  Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
 affliction, and sorrow.

PSA 107:40  He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the
 wilderness, where there is no way.

PSA 107:41  Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him
 families like a flock.

PSA 107:42  The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall
 stop her mouth.

PSA 107:43  Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
 understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.

PSA 108:1  O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my
 glory.

PSA 108:2  Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

PSA 108:3  I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
 praises unto thee among the nations.

PSA 108:4  For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth
 unto the clouds.

PSA 108:5  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all
 the earth;

PSA 108:6  That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and
 answer me.

PSA 108:7  God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
 Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

PSA 108:8  Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of
 mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

PSA 108:9  Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
 Philistia will I triumph.

PSA 108:10  Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?

PSA 108:11  Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O
 God, go forth with our hosts?

PSA 108:12  Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

PSA 108:13  Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread
 down our enemies.

PSA 109:1  Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

PSA 109:2  For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
 opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.

PSA 109:3  They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
 against me without a cause.

PSA 109:4  For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.

PSA 109:5  And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

PSA 109:6  Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right
 hand.

PSA 109:7  When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer
 become sin.

PSA 109:8  Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

PSA 109:9  Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

PSA 109:10  Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek
 their bread also out of their desolate places.

PSA 109:11  Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers
 spoil his labour.

PSA 109:12  Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be
 any to favour his fatherless children.

PSA 109:13  Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let
 their name be blotted out.

PSA 109:14  Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and
 let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

PSA 109:15  Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the
 memory of them from the earth.

PSA 109:16  Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the
 poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.

PSA 109:17  As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not
 in blessing, so let it be far from him.

PSA 109:18  As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let
 it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

PSA 109:19  Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a
 girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

PSA 109:20  Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
 of them that speak evil against my soul.

PSA 109:21  But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because
 thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

PSA 109:22  For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

PSA 109:23  I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and
 down as the locust.

PSA 109:24  My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.

PSA 109:25  I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they
 shaked their heads.

PSA 109:26  Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

PSA 109:27  That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast
 done it.

PSA 109:28  Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
 ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

PSA 109:29  Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
 themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

PSA 109:30  I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise
 him among the multitude.

PSA 109:31  For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from
 those that condemn his soul.

PSA 110:1  The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make
 thine enemies thy footstool.

PSA 110:2  The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou
 in the midst of thine enemies.

PSA 110:3  Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties
 of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.

PSA 110:4  The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever
 after the order of Melchizedek.

PSA 110:5  The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of
 his wrath.

PSA 110:6  He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the
 dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.

PSA 110:7  He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up
 the head.

PSA 111:1  Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart,
 in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.

PSA 111:2  The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have
 pleasure therein.

PSA 111:3  His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth
 for ever.

PSA 111:4  He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
 gracious and full of compassion.

PSA 111:5  He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful
 of his covenant.

PSA 111:6  He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give
 them the heritage of the heathen.

PSA 111:7  The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments
 are sure.

PSA 111:8  They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
 uprightness.

PSA 111:9  He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant
 for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

PSA 111:10  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
 understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for
 ever.

PSA 112:1  Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that
 delighteth greatly in his commandments.

PSA 112:2  His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright
 shall be blessed.

PSA 112:3  Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
 endureth for ever.

PSA 112:4  Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
 gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

PSA 112:5  A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs
 with discretion.

PSA 112:6  Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in
 everlasting remembrance.

PSA 112:7  He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting
 in the LORD.

PSA 112:8  His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his
 desire upon his enemies.

PSA 112:9  He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
 endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.

PSA 112:10  The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his
 teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.

PSA 113:1  Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the
 name of the LORD.

PSA 113:2  Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
 evermore.

PSA 113:3  From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
 LORD's name is to be praised.

PSA 113:4  The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.

PSA 113:5  Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

PSA 113:6  Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and
 in the earth!

PSA 113:7  He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out
 of the dunghill;

PSA 113:8  That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
 people.

PSA 113:9  He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother
 of children. Praise ye the LORD.

PSA 114:1  When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of
 strange language;

PSA 114:2  Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

PSA 114:3  The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

PSA 114:4  The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.

PSA 114:5  What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that
 thou wast driven back?

PSA 114:6  Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like
 lambs?

PSA 114:7  Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence
 of the God of Jacob;

PSA 114:8  Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
 fountain of waters.

PSA 115:1  Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for
 thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

PSA 115:2  Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?

PSA 115:3  But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
 pleased.

PSA 115:4  Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

PSA 115:5  They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see
 not:

PSA 115:6  They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell
 not:

PSA 115:7  They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk
 not: neither speak they through their throat.

PSA 115:8  They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
 trusteth in them.

PSA 115:9  O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.

PSA 115:10  O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their
 shield.

PSA 115:11  Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
 their shield.

PSA 115:12  The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless
 the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.

PSA 115:13  He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

PSA 115:14  The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.

PSA 115:15  Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.

PSA 115:16  The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he
 given to the children of men.

PSA 115:17  The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
 silence.

PSA 115:18  But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.
 Praise the LORD.

PSA 116:1  I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
 supplications.

PSA 116:2  Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon
 him as long as I live.

PSA 116:3  The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold
 upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

PSA 116:4  Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee,
 deliver my soul.

PSA 116:5  Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.

PSA 116:6  The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.

PSA 116:7  Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully
 with thee.

PSA 116:8  For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears,
 and my feet from falling.

PSA 116:9  I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

PSA 116:10  I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

PSA 116:11  I said in my haste, All men are liars.

PSA 116:12  What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?

PSA 116:13  I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the
 LORD.

PSA 116:14  I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
 people.

PSA 116:15  Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.

PSA 116:16  O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of
 thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

PSA 116:17  I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call
 upon the name of the LORD.

PSA 116:18  I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
 people.

PSA 116:19  In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O
 Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

PSA 117:1  O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.

PSA 117:2  For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the
 LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.

PSA 118:1  O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
 endureth for ever.

PSA 118:2  Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

PSA 118:3  Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

PSA 118:4  Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for
 ever.

PSA 118:5  I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me
 in a large place.

PSA 118:6  The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?

PSA 118:7  The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I
 see my desire upon them that hate me.

PSA 118:8  It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.

PSA 118:9  It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.

PSA 118:10  All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I
 destroy them.

PSA 118:11  They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the
 name of the LORD I will destroy them.

PSA 118:12  They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of
 thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

PSA 118:13  Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped
 me.

PSA 118:14  The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

PSA 118:15  The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the
 righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

PSA 118:16  The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD
 doeth valiantly.

PSA 118:17  I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

PSA 118:18  The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto
 death.

PSA 118:19  Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I
 will praise the LORD:

PSA 118:20  This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

PSA 118:21  I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
 salvation.

PSA 118:22  The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
 of the corner.

PSA 118:23  This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.

PSA 118:24  This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be
 glad in it.

PSA 118:25  Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now
 prosperity.

PSA 118:26  Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed
 you out of the house of the LORD.

PSA 118:27  God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice
 with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

PSA 118:28  Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will
 exalt thee.

PSA 118:29  O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth
 for ever.

PSA 119:1  Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
 LORD.

PSA 119:2  Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with
 the whole heart.

PSA 119:3  They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.

PSA 119:4  Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.

PSA 119:5  O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!

PSA 119:6  Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
 commandments.

PSA 119:7  I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have
 learned thy righteous judgments.

PSA 119:8  I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.

PSA 119:9  Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
 thereto according to thy word.

PSA 119:10  With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from
 thy commandments.

PSA 119:11  Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against
 thee.

PSA 119:12  Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.

PSA 119:13  With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.

PSA 119:14  I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all
 riches.

PSA 119:15  I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.

PSA 119:16  I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.

PSA 119:17  Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy
 word.

PSA 119:18  Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy
 law.

PSA 119:19  I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.

PSA 119:20  My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at
 all times.

PSA 119:21  Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy
 commandments.

PSA 119:22  Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
 testimonies.

PSA 119:23  Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
 meditate in thy statutes.

PSA 119:24  Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.leth.

PSA 119:25  My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy
 word.

PSA 119:26  I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
 statutes.

PSA 119:27  Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of
 thy wondrous works.

PSA 119:28  My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto
 thy word.

PSA 119:29  Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.

PSA 119:30  I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before
 me.

PSA 119:31  I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.

PSA 119:32  I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my
 heart.

PSA 119:33  Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto
 the end.

PSA 119:34  Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
 observe it with my whole heart.

PSA 119:35  Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I
 delight.

PSA 119:36  Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.

PSA 119:37  Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in
 thy way.

PSA 119:38  Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.

PSA 119:39  Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.

PSA 119:40  Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
 righteousness.

PSA 119:41  Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
 according to thy word.

PSA 119:42  So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I
 trust in thy word.

PSA 119:43  And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have
 hoped in thy judgments.

PSA 119:44  So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.

PSA 119:45  And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.

PSA 119:46  I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be
 ashamed.

PSA 119:47  And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.

PSA 119:48  My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have
 loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

PSA 119:49  Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me
 to hope.

PSA 119:50  This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened
 me.

PSA 119:51  The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined
 from thy law.

PSA 119:52  I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
 myself.

PSA 119:53  Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake
 thy law.

PSA 119:54  Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.

PSA 119:55  I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy
 law.

PSA 119:56  This I had, because I kept thy precepts.

PSA 119:57  Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
 words.

PSA 119:58  I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me
 according to thy word.

PSA 119:59  I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

PSA 119:60  I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

PSA 119:61  The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten
 thy law.

PSA 119:62  At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy
 righteous judgments.

PSA 119:63  I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep
 thy precepts.

PSA 119:64  The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.

PSA 119:65  Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy
 word.

PSA 119:66  Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
 commandments.

PSA 119:67  Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.

PSA 119:68  Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

PSA 119:69  The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
 precepts with my whole heart.

PSA 119:70  Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.

PSA 119:71  It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn
 thy statutes.

PSA 119:72  The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and
 silver.

PSA 119:73  Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding,
 that I may learn thy commandments.

PSA 119:74  They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have
 hoped in thy word.

PSA 119:75  I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
 faithfulness hast afflicted me.

PSA 119:76  Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
 according to thy word unto thy servant.

PSA 119:77  Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law
 is my delight.

PSA 119:78  Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without
 a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.

PSA 119:79  Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known
 thy testimonies.

PSA 119:80  Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.

PSA 119:81  My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.

PSA 119:82  Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?

PSA 119:83  For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy
 statutes.

PSA 119:84  How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
 judgment on them that persecute me?

PSA 119:85  The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.

PSA 119:86  All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully;
 help thou me.

PSA 119:87  They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
 precepts.

PSA 119:88  Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony
 of thy mouth.

PSA 119:89  For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

PSA 119:90  Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the
 earth, and it abideth.

PSA 119:91  They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are
 thy servants.

PSA 119:92  Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in
 mine affliction.

PSA 119:93  I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened
 me.

PSA 119:94  I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.

PSA 119:95  The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider
 thy testimonies.

PSA 119:96  I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
 exceeding broad.

PSA 119:97  O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.

PSA 119:98  Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies:
 for they are ever with me.

PSA 119:99  I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies
 are my meditation.

PSA 119:100  I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.

PSA 119:101  I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep
 thy word.

PSA 119:102  I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.

PSA 119:103  How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to
 my mouth!

PSA 119:104  Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every
 false way.

PSA 119:105  Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

PSA 119:106  I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
 righteous judgments.

PSA 119:107  I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy
 word.

PSA 119:108  Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
 LORD, and teach me thy judgments.

PSA 119:109  My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.

PSA 119:110  The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
 precepts.

PSA 119:111  Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are
 the rejoicing of my heart.

PSA 119:112  I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
 unto the end.

PSA 119:113  I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.

PSA 119:114  Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.

PSA 119:115  Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of
 my God.

PSA 119:116  Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not
 be ashamed of my hope.

PSA 119:117  Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto
 thy statutes continually.

PSA 119:118  Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for
 their deceit is falsehood.

PSA 119:119  Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
 therefore I love thy testimonies.

PSA 119:120  My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
 judgments.

PSA 119:121  I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.

PSA 119:122  Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.

PSA 119:123  Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
 righteousness.

PSA 119:124  Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy
 statutes.

PSA 119:125  I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
 testimonies.

PSA 119:126  It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy
 law.

PSA 119:127  Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
 gold.

PSA 119:128  Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be
 right; and I hate every false way.

PSA 119:129  Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.

PSA 119:130  The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding
 unto the simple.

PSA 119:131  I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.

PSA 119:132  Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do
 unto those that love thy name.

PSA 119:133  Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion
 over me.

PSA 119:134  Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
 precepts.

PSA 119:135  Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
 statutes.

PSA 119:136  Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
 law.

PSA 119:137  Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.

PSA 119:138  Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very
 faithful.

PSA 119:139  My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy
 words.

PSA 119:140  Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.

PSA 119:141  I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.

PSA 119:142  Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is
 the truth.

PSA 119:143  Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments
 are my delights.

PSA 119:144  The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
 understanding, and I shall live.

PSA 119:145  I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
 statutes.

PSA 119:146  I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.

PSA 119:147  I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy
 word.

PSA 119:148  Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy
 word.

PSA 119:149  Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken
 me according to thy judgment.

PSA 119:150  They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy
 law.

PSA 119:151  Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.

PSA 119:152  Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
 founded them for ever.

PSA 119:153  Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy
 law.

PSA 119:154  Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.

PSA 119:155  Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.

PSA 119:156  Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy
 judgments.

PSA 119:157  Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
 from thy testimonies.

PSA 119:158  I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not
 thy word.

PSA 119:159  Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to
 thy lovingkindness.

PSA 119:160  Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
 righteous judgments endureth for ever.

PSA 119:161  Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth
 in awe of thy word.

PSA 119:162  I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.

PSA 119:163  I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.

PSA 119:164  Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
 judgments.

PSA 119:165  Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend
 them.

PSA 119:166  LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.

PSA 119:167  My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.

PSA 119:168  I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are
 before thee.

PSA 119:169  Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding
 according to thy word.

PSA 119:170  Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy
 word.

PSA 119:171  My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.

PSA 119:172  My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are
 righteousness.

PSA 119:173  Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.

PSA 119:174  I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
 delight.

PSA 119:175  Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments
 help me.

PSA 119:176  I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do
 not forget thy commandments.

PSA 120:1  In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.

PSA 120:2  Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
 tongue.

PSA 120:3  What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou
 false tongue?

PSA 120:4  Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

PSA 120:5  Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of
 Kedar!

PSA 120:6  My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.

PSA 120:7  I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.

PSA 121:1  I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.

PSA 121:2  My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.

PSA 121:3  He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will
 not slumber.

PSA 121:4  Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.

PSA 121:5  The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.

PSA 121:6  The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

PSA 121:7  The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy
 soul.

PSA 121:8  The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this
 time forth, and even for evermore.

PSA 122:1  I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the
 LORD.

PSA 122:2  Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

PSA 122:3  Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

PSA 122:4  Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony
 of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

PSA 122:5  For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of
 David.

PSA 122:6  Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.

PSA 122:7  Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

PSA 122:8  For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be
 within thee.

PSA 122:9  Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.

PSA 123:1  Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.

PSA 123:2  Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters,
 and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait
 upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.

PSA 123:3  Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
 exceedingly filled with contempt.

PSA 123:4  Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are
 at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

PSA 124:1  If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;

PSA 124:2  If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up
 against us:

PSA 124:3  Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled
 against us:

PSA 124:4  Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our
 soul:

PSA 124:5  Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

PSA 124:6  Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.

PSA 124:7  Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the
 snare is broken, and we are escaped.

PSA 124:8  Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.

PSA 125:1  They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be
 removed, but abideth for ever.

PSA 125:2  As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round
 about his people from henceforth even for ever.

PSA 125:3  For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
 righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.

PSA 125:4  Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
 upright in their hearts.

PSA 125:5  As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall
 lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.

PSA 126:1  When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them
 that dream.

PSA 126:2  Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
 singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things
 for them.

PSA 126:3  The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

PSA 126:4  Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

PSA 126:5  They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

PSA 126:6  He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
 doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.

PSA 127:1  Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it:
 except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.

PSA 127:2  It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the
 bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

PSA 127:3  Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb
 is his reward.

PSA 127:4  As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the
 youth.

PSA 127:5  Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not
 be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.

PSA 128:1  Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his
 ways.

PSA 128:2  For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou
 be, and it shall be well with thee.

PSA 128:3  Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house:
 thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

PSA 128:4  Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.

PSA 128:5  The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good
 of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

PSA 128:6  Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.

PSA 129:1  Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now
 say:

PSA 129:2  Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not
 prevailed against me.

PSA 129:3  The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

PSA 129:4  The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.

PSA 129:5  Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

PSA 129:6  Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore
 it groweth up:

PSA 129:7  Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
 sheaves his bosom.

PSA 129:8  Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon
 you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

PSA 130:1  Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

PSA 130:2  Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my
 supplications.

PSA 130:3  If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?

PSA 130:4  But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.

PSA 130:5  I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.

PSA 130:6  My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
 morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

PSA 130:7  Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and
 with him is plenteous redemption.

PSA 130:8  And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

PSA 131:1  Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I
 exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.

PSA 131:2  Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned
 of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

PSA 131:3  Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.

PSA 132:1  Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:

PSA 132:2  How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;

PSA 132:3  Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up
 into my bed;

PSA 132:4  I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,

PSA 132:5  Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty
 God of Jacob.

PSA 132:6  Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the
 wood.

PSA 132:7  We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.

PSA 132:8  Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.

PSA 132:9  Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints
 shout for joy.

PSA 132:10  For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
 anointed.

PSA 132:11  The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it;
 Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

PSA 132:12  If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall
 teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.

PSA 132:13  For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
 habitation.

PSA 132:14  This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.

PSA 132:15  I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with
 bread.

PSA 132:16  I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall
 shout aloud for joy.

PSA 132:17  There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp
 for mine anointed.

PSA 132:18  His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his
 crown flourish.

PSA 133:1  Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
 together in unity!

PSA 133:2  It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon
 the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;

PSA 133:3  As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
 mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for
 evermore.

PSA 134:1  Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by
 night stand in the house of the LORD.

PSA 134:2  Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.

PSA 134:3  The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.

PSA 135:1  Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye
 servants of the LORD.

PSA 135:2  Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house
 of our God.

PSA 135:3  Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name;
 for it is pleasant.

PSA 135:4  For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his
 peculiar treasure.

PSA 135:5  For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all
 gods.

PSA 135:6  Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth,
 in the seas, and all deep places.

PSA 135:7  He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he
 maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.

PSA 135:8  Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

PSA 135:9  Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon
 Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

PSA 135:10  Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

PSA 135:11  Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
 kingdoms of Canaan:

PSA 135:12  And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his
 people.

PSA 135:13  Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD,
 throughout all generations.

PSA 135:14  For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself
 concerning his servants.

PSA 135:15  The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's
 hands.

PSA 135:16  They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see
 not;

PSA 135:17  They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath
 in their mouths.

PSA 135:18  They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that
 trusteth in them.

PSA 135:19  Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of
 Aaron:

PSA 135:20  Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the
 LORD.

PSA 135:21  Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
 Praise ye the LORD.

PSA 136:1  O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth
 for ever.

PSA 136:2  O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.

PSA 136:3  O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.

PSA 136:4  To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for
 ever.

PSA 136:5  To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for
 ever.

PSA 136:6  To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy
 endureth for ever.

PSA 136:7  To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:

PSA 136:8  The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:

PSA 136:9  The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for
 ever.

PSA 136:10  To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth
 for ever:

PSA 136:11  And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for
 ever:

PSA 136:12  With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy
 endureth for ever.

PSA 136:13  To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth
 for ever:

PSA 136:14  And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy
 endureth for ever:

PSA 136:15  But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy
 endureth for ever.

PSA 136:16  To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy
 endureth for ever.

PSA 136:17  To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:

PSA 136:18  And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:

PSA 136:19  Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:

PSA 136:20  And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:

PSA 136:21  And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for
 ever:

PSA 136:22  Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth
 for ever.

PSA 136:23  Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for
 ever:

PSA 136:24  And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for
 ever.

PSA 136:25  Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.

PSA 136:26  O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for
 ever.

PSA 137:1  By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we
 remembered Zion.

PSA 137:2  We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

PSA 137:3  For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song;
 and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the
 songs of Zion.

PSA 137:4  How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

PSA 137:5  If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.

PSA 137:6  If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my
 mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

PSA 137:7  Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who
 said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.

PSA 137:8  O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be,
 that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

PSA 137:9  Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against
 the stones.

PSA 138:1  I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing
 praise unto thee.

PSA 138:2  I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy
 lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all
 thy name.

PSA 138:3  In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me
 with strength in my soul.

PSA 138:4  All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear
 the words of thy mouth.

PSA 138:5  Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory
 of the LORD.

PSA 138:6  Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the
 proud he knoweth afar off.

PSA 138:7  Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou
 shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy
 right hand shall save me.

PSA 138:8  The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD,
 endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.

PSA 139:1  O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.

PSA 139:2  Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my
 thought afar off.

PSA 139:3  Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with
 all my ways.

PSA 139:4  For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest
 it altogether.

PSA 139:5  Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.

PSA 139:6  Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain
 unto it.

PSA 139:7  Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy
 presence?

PSA 139:8  If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in
 hell, behold, thou art there.

PSA 139:9  If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts
 of the sea;

PSA 139:10  Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold
 me.

PSA 139:11  If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall
 be light about me.

PSA 139:12  Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as
 the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

PSA 139:13  For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
 mother's womb.

PSA 139:14  I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
 marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

PSA 139:15  My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and
 curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

PSA 139:16  Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy
 book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when
 as yet there was none of them.

PSA 139:17  How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the
 sum of them!

PSA 139:18  If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when
 I awake, I am still with thee.

PSA 139:19  Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore,
 ye bloody men.

PSA 139:20  For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy
 name in vain.

PSA 139:21  Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved
 with those that rise up against thee?

PSA 139:22  I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

PSA 139:23  Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:

PSA 139:24  And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
 everlasting.

PSA 140:1  Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent
 man;

PSA 140:2  Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they
 gathered together for war.

PSA 140:3  They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is
 under their lips. Selah.

PSA 140:4  Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the
 violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.

PSA 140:5  The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net
 by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

PSA 140:6  I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my
 supplications, O LORD.

PSA 140:7  O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my
 head in the day of battle.

PSA 140:8  Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked
 device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

PSA 140:9  As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief
 of their own lips cover them.

PSA 140:10  Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire;
 into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

PSA 140:11  Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall
 hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

PSA 140:12  I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and
 the right of the poor.

PSA 140:13  Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright
 shall dwell in thy presence.

PSA 141:1  Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice,
 when I cry unto thee.

PSA 141:2  Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting
 up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

PSA 141:3  Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.

PSA 141:4  Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works
 with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.

PSA 141:5  Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him
 reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for
 yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.

PSA 141:6  When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my
 words; for they are sweet.

PSA 141:7  Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth
 and cleaveth wood upon the earth.

PSA 141:8  But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust;
 leave not my soul destitute.

PSA 141:9  Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins
 of the workers of iniquity.

PSA 141:10  Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal
 escape.

PSA 142:1  I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did
 I make my supplication.

PSA 142:2  I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
 trouble.

PSA 142:3  When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path.
 In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.

PSA 142:4  I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that
 would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.

PSA 142:5  I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion
 in the land of the living.

PSA 142:6  Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my
 persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

PSA 142:7  Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the
 righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.

PSA 143:1  Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
 faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.

PSA 143:2  And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall
 no man living be justified.

PSA 143:3  For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down
 to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been
 long dead.

PSA 143:4  Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is
 desolate.

PSA 143:5  I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on
 the work of thy hands.

PSA 143:6  I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as
 a thirsty land. Selah.

PSA 143:7  Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from
 me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

PSA 143:8  Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I
 trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul
 unto thee.

PSA 143:9  Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.

PSA 143:10  Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good;
 lead me into the land of uprightness.

PSA 143:11  Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness'
 sake bring my soul out of trouble.

PSA 143:12  And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that
 afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.

PSA 144:1  Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and
 my fingers to fight:

PSA 144:2  My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my
 shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.

PSA 144:3  LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of
 man, that thou makest account of him!

PSA 144:4  Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.

PSA 144:5  Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and
 they shall smoke.

PSA 144:6  Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and
 destroy them.

PSA 144:7  Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great
 waters, from the hand of strange children;

PSA 144:8  Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of
 falsehood.

PSA 144:9  I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an
 instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

PSA 144:10  It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his
 servant from the hurtful sword.

PSA 144:11  Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose
 mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:

PSA 144:12  That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our
 daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:

PSA 144:13  That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that
 our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:

PSA 144:14  That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking
 in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.

PSA 144:15  Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that
 people, whose God is the LORD.

PSA 145:1  I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for
 ever and ever.

PSA 145:2  Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and
 ever.

PSA 145:3  Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is
 unsearchable.

PSA 145:4  One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare
 thy mighty acts.

PSA 145:5  I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy
 wondrous works.

PSA 145:6  And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will
 declare thy greatness.

PSA 145:7  They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and
 shall sing of thy righteousness.

PSA 145:8  The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of
 great mercy.

PSA 145:9  The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his
 works.

PSA 145:10  All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless
 thee.

PSA 145:11  They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
 power;

PSA 145:12  To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious
 majesty of his kingdom.

PSA 145:13  Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth
 throughout all generations.

PSA 145:14  The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be
 bowed down.

PSA 145:15  The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in
 due season.

PSA 145:16  Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living
 thing.

PSA 145:17  The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.

PSA 145:18  The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call
 upon him in truth.

PSA 145:19  He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear
 their cry, and will save them.

PSA 145:20  The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will
 he destroy.

PSA 145:21  My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh
 bless his holy name for ever and ever.

PSA 146:1  Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

PSA 146:2  While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God
 while I have any being.

PSA 146:3  Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there
 is no help.

PSA 146:4  His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day
 his thoughts perish.

PSA 146:5  Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is
 in the LORD his God:

PSA 146:6  Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is:
 which keepeth truth for ever:

PSA 146:7  Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the
 hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

PSA 146:8  The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that
 are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:

PSA 146:9  The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and
 widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

PSA 146:10  The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
 generations. Praise ye the LORD.

PSA 147:1  Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for
 it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

PSA 147:2  The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts
 of Israel.

PSA 147:3  He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

PSA 147:4  He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their
 names.

PSA 147:5  Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
 infinite.

PSA 147:6  The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the
 ground.

PSA 147:7  Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto
 our God:

PSA 147:8  Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the
 earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

PSA 147:9  He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.

PSA 147:10  He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
 pleasure in the legs of a man.

PSA 147:11  The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope
 in his mercy.

PSA 147:12  Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

PSA 147:13  For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy
 children within thee.

PSA 147:14  He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest
 of the wheat.

PSA 147:15  He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very
 swiftly.

PSA 147:16  He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.

PSA 147:17  He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his
 cold?

PSA 147:18  He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to
 blow, and the waters flow.

PSA 147:19  He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto
 Israel.

PSA 147:20  He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments,
 they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.

PSA 148:1  Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him
 in the heights.

PSA 148:2  Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

PSA 148:3  Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.

PSA 148:4  Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the
 heavens.

PSA 148:5  Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they
 were created.

PSA 148:6  He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a
 decree which shall not pass.

PSA 148:7  Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:

PSA 148:8  Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word:

PSA 148:9  Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

PSA 148:10  Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

PSA 148:11  Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the
 earth:

PSA 148:12  Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

PSA 148:13  Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
 excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

PSA 148:14  He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
 saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the
 LORD.

PSA 149:1  Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise
 in the congregation of saints.

PSA 149:2  Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be
 joyful in their King.

PSA 149:3  Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto
 him with the timbrel and harp.

PSA 149:4  For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the
 meek with salvation.

PSA 149:5  Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their
 beds.

PSA 149:6  Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword
 in their hand;

PSA 149:7  To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the
 people;

PSA 149:8  To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of
 iron;

PSA 149:9  To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his
 saints. Praise ye the LORD.

PSA 150:1  Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the
 firmament of his power.

PSA 150:2  Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his
 excellent greatness.

PSA 150:3  Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the
 psaltery and harp.

PSA 150:4  Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed
 instruments and organs.

PSA 150:5  Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding
 cymbals.

PSA 150:6  Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the
 LORD.

SON 1:1  The song of songs, which is Solomon's.

SON 1:2  Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better
 than wine.

SON 1:3  Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment
 poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

SON 1:4  Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his
 chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more
 than wine: the upright love thee.

SON 1:5  I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of
 Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

SON 1:6  Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon
 me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the
 vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.

SON 1:7  Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou
 makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth
 aside by the flocks of thy companions?

SON 1:8  If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the
 footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.

SON 1:9  I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's
 chariots.

SON 1:10  Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of
 gold.

SON 1:11  We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

SON 1:12  While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the
 smell thereof.

SON 1:13  A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night
 betwixt my breasts.

SON 1:14  My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of
 Engedi.

SON 1:15  Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast
 doves' eyes.

SON 1:16  Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is
 green.

SON 1:17  The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.

SON 2:1  I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.

SON 2:2  As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

SON 2:3  As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among
 the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was
 sweet to my taste.

SON 2:4  He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was
 love.

SON 2:5  Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.

SON 2:6  His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.

SON 2:7  I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the
 hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.

SON 2:8  The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains,
 skipping upon the hills.

SON 2:9  My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind
 our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the
 lattice.

SON 2:10  My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair
 one, and come away.

SON 2:11  For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;

SON 2:12  The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is
 come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;

SON 2:13  The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the
 tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

SON 2:14  O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places
 of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet
 is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.

SON 2:15  Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our
 vines have tender grapes.

SON 2:16  My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

SON 2:17  Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and
 be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.

SON 3:1  By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but
 I found him not.

SON 3:2  I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the
 broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him
 not.

SON 3:3  The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye
 him whom my soul loveth?

SON 3:4  It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my
 soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him
 into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.

SON 3:5  I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the
 hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.

SON 3:6  Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke,
 perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?

SON 3:7  Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about
 it, of the valiant of Israel.

SON 3:8  They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword
 upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

SON 3:9  King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

SON 3:10  He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of
 gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love,
 for the daughters of Jerusalem.

SON 3:11  Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the
 crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and
 in the day of the gladness of his heart.

SON 4:1  Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast
 doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear
 from mount Gilead.

SON 4:2  Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up
 from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among
 them.

SON 4:3  Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy
 temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.

SON 4:4  Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon
 there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.

SON 4:5  Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed
 among the lilies.

SON 4:6  Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the
 mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

SON 4:7  Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.

SON 4:8  Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from
 the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens,
 from the mountains of the leopards.

SON 4:9  Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished
 my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.

SON 4:10  How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy
 love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!

SON 4:11  Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are
 under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.

SON 4:12  A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a
 fountain sealed.

SON 4:13  Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;
 camphire, with spikenard,

SON 4:14  Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of
 frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

SON 4:15  A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from
 Lebanon.

SON 4:16  Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that
 the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat
 his pleasant fruits.

SON 5:1  I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my
 myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my
 wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

SON 5:2  I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that
 knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for
 my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.

SON 5:3  I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet;
 how shall I defile them?

SON 5:4  My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were
 moved for him.

SON 5:5  I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and
 my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.

SON 5:6  I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was
 gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I
 called him, but he gave me no answer.

SON 5:7  The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they
 wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.

SON 5:8  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye
 tell him, that I am sick of love.

SON 5:9  What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among
 women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so
 charge us?

SON 5:10  My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.

SON 5:11  His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as
 a raven.

SON 5:12  His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed
 with milk, and fitly set.

SON 5:13  His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like
 lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

SON 5:14  His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as
 bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.

SON 5:15  His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his
 countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

SON 5:16  His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my
 beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

SON 6:1  Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is
 thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.

SON 6:2  My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to
 feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

SON 6:3  I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the
 lilies.

SON 6:4  Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem,
 terrible as an army with banners.

SON 6:5  Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is
 as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

SON 6:6  Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing,
 whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.

SON 6:7  As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.

SON 6:8  There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins
 without number.

SON 6:9  My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother,
 she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and
 blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.

SON 6:10  Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear
 as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?

SON 6:11  I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the
 valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.

SON 6:12  Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.

SON 6:13  Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon
 thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two
 armies.

SON 7:1  How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints
 of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.

SON 7:2  Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly
 is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

SON 7:3  Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

SON 7:4  Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in
 Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which
 looketh toward Damascus.

SON 7:5  Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like
 purple; the king is held in the galleries.

SON 7:6  How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

SON 7:7  This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters
 of grapes.

SON 7:8  I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs
 thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell
 of thy nose like apples;

SON 7:9  And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that
 goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.

SON 7:10  I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.

SON 7:11  Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the
 villages.

SON 7:12  Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine
 flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth:
 there will I give thee my loves.

SON 7:13  The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of
 pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.

SON 8:1  O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!
 when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be
 despised.

SON 8:2  I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would
 instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my
 pomegranate.

SON 8:3  His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should
 embrace me.

SON 8:4  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake
 my love, until he please.

SON 8:5  Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her
 beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee
 forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.

SON 8:6  Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love
 is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are
 coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.

SON 8:7  Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a
 man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be
 contemned.

SON 8:8  We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for
 our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

SON 8:9  If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if
 she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.

SON 8:10  I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as
 one that found favour.

SON 8:11  Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto
 keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of
 silver.

SON 8:12  My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have
 a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.

SON 8:13  Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy
 voice: cause me to hear it.

SON 8:14  Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart
 upon the mountains of spices.
