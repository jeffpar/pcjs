## Information about "OPUS 1 BRAIN TEASERS TRIVIA GAME"

    Have you worn out your edition of Trivial Pursuit?  Wish you could have
    more than six categories to test your brain cells?  OPUS 1 BRAIN TEASERS
    fill this need.
    
    OPUS 1 is a trivia-oriented game for up to four people.  There are 25
    different categories to choose from.  A few of the diverse categories
    are:  body talk, tv & film, 1-2-3, two-way words, books, and plays.
    
    The game is played much like you would play Charades, with the clues
    brought up as a graphic clue.  For example, The Graduate has the clue
    ``GRADUUUUUUUU'' (Grad + eight U's = Grad-u-eight).  Have fun!
