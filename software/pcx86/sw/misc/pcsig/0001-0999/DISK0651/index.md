## Information about "TURBO CALC"

    Turbo Calc is a spreadsheet program of about medium size; 512 rows by
    64 columns. It is relatively easy to use and supports the usual
    range of functions, as well as text entries. Commands are by
    letter entry and there is on screen display of command choices.
    
    AsEasyAs is a refined spreadsheet program supporting 52 columns and 200
    rows. Worksheet extension is .wks and files are compatible with another
    popular spreadsheet program. Function keys are utilized, and operation
    is by use of complete on-screen menus. AsEasyAs creates x-y
    graphs and bar charts as well.
    
    System Requirements:  256K, two floppy drives and a monochrome display;
    AsEasyAs requires a graphics option for its x-y graphs and bar charts.
    
    How to Start:  Consult all documentation files before starting either
    program (they are marked with filename.DOC).  While the TurboCalc
    program can be run immediately, you must use the ARC utility to un-
    archive the AsEasyAs program.  Once done, either may be started from
    the DOS prompt.
