## Information about "PRESENT"

    This diskette contains the complete set of PRESENT programs (version

    manual slide projector. But this slide projector is special, it has
    fades,  color changes, picture "piecing", and other things that a
    computer can do to video.
    
    System Requirements:  128K RAM, color graphics, and joysticks.
    
    How to Start:  Load DOS and type PRESENT to enter the main program.
    Consult PRESENT.DOC for program documentation.
