## Information about "THE BIBLE 3-7 (766,767,769,770,771,772)"

    This disk is part of a seven-disk set with the entire King James version
    of the Bible.  It is in text file format, making it easy to locate
    verses, add passages into documents, or prepare manuscript studies.
    
    Since it is all ASCII text files, each book is a separate file.  When
    you get the disks, the files are archived, or ``squeezed'', so you must
    first unsqueeze them onto either 19 other 360K floppies or onto your
    hard drive.  Be advised that some books of the Bible are too long to fit
    into some wordprocessors that limit the size of documents to the amount
    of available RAM.
    
    To view or search these files, you need to use a wordprocessor or some
    kind of viewing shell.  No such program is provided on this disk.

 quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of old.

CH1 4:41  And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of
 Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and
 destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their rooms: because there
 was pasture there for their flocks.

 dwelt there unto this day.

CH1 5:1  Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the
 firstborn; but forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was
 given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to
 be reckoned after the birthright.

CH1 5:2  For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief
 ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)

 captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.

CH1 5:7  And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their
 generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,

CH1 5:8  And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt
 in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:

CH1 5:9  And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from
 the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of
 Gilead.

CH1 5:10  And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by
 their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east land of
 Gilead.

CH1 5:11  And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of
 Bashan unto Salcah:

CH1 5:12  Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in

 threescore, that went out to the war.

CH1 5:19  And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and
 Nodab.

CH1 5:20  And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered
 into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the
 battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him.

CH1 5:21  And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and
 of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of
 men an hundred thousand.

CH1 5:22  For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they
 dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

CH1 5:23  And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land:
 they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon.

CH1 5:24  And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even
 Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and
 Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and heads of the house of their
 fathers.

CH1 5:25  And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a
 whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before
 them.

CH1 5:26  And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of
 Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried
 them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of
 Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river
 Gozan, unto this day.

CH1 9:16  And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of
 Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the
 villages of the Netophathites.

CH1 9:17  And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and
 their brethren: Shallum was the chief;

CH1 9:18  Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were porters
 in the companies of the children of Levi.

CH1 9:19  And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of
 Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over
 the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their
 fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.

CH1 9:20  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time
 past, and the LORD was with him.

CH1 9:21  And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation.

CH1 9:22  All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two
 hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages,
 whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.

CH1 9:23  So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the
 house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.

CH1 9:24  In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and
 south.

CH1 9:25  And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after
 seven days from time to time with them.

CH1 9:26  For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set
 office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.

CH1 9:27  And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was
 upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them.

CH1 9:28  And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that
 they should bring them in and out by tale.

CH1 9:29  Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the
 instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the
 oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

CH1 9:30  And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.

CH1 9:31  And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum
 the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.

CH1 9:32  And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over
 the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.

CH1 9:33  And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who
 remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day
 and night.

CH1 9:34  These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their
 generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.

CH1 9:35  And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name
 was Maachah:

CH1 9:36  And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and
 Ner, and Nadab.

CH1 9:37  And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.

CH1 9:38  And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at
 Jerusalem, over against their brethren.

CH1 9:39  And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and
 Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

CH1 9:40  And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat Micah.

CH1 9:41  And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz.

CH1 9:42  And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and
 Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;

CH1 9:43  And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his
 son.

CH1 9:44  And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and
 Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.

CH1 10:1  Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled
 from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

CH1 10:2  And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and
 the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of
 Saul.

CH1 10:3  And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and
 he was wounded of the archers.

CH1 10:4  Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me
 through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his
 armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and
 fell upon it.

CH1 10:5  And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on
 the sword, and died.

CH1 10:6  So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.

CH1 10:7  And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they
 fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities,
 and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

CH1 10:8  And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip
 the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

CH1 10:9  And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his
 armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry
 tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

CH1 10:10  And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his
 head in the temple of Dagon.

CH1 10:11  And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to
 Saul,

CH1 10:12  They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and
 the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones
 under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

CH1 10:13  So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the
 LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for
 asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it;

CH1 10:14  And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the
 kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

CH1 11:1  Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying,
 Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

CH1 11:2  And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that
 leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee,
 Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people
 Israel.

CH1 11:3  Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and
 David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed
 David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.

CH1 11:4  And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the
 Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.

CH1 11:5  And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come
 hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of
 David.

CH1 11:6  And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief
 and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.

CH1 11:7  And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of
 David.

CH1 11:8  And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and
 Joab repaired the rest of the city.

CH1 11:9  So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with
 him.

CH1 11:10  These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who
 strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make
 him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.

CH1 11:11  And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam,
 an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against
 three hundred slain by him at one time.

CH1 11:12  And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one
 of the three mighties.

CH1 11:13  He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were
 gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and
 the people fled from before the Philistines.

CH1 11:14  And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered
 it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.

CH1 11:15  Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David,
 into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the
 valley of Rephaim.

CH1 11:16  And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was
 then at Bethlehem.

CH1 11:17  And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the
 water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!

CH1 11:18  And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew
 water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and
 brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out
 to the LORD.

CH1 11:19  And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I
 drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with
 the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it.
 These things did these three mightiest.

CH1 11:20  And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for
 lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name
 among the three.

CH1 11:21  Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their
 captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.

CH1 11:22  Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel,
 who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down
 and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.

CH1 11:23  And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high;
 and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down
 to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and
 slew him with his own spear.

CH1 11:24  These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among
 the three mighties.

CH1 11:25  Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the
 first three: and David set him over his guard.

CH1 11:26  Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab,
 Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

CH1 11:27  Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

CH1 11:28  Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,

CH1 11:29  Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

CH1 11:30  Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,

CH1 11:31  Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the children of
 Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

CH1 11:32  Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

CH1 11:33  Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

CH1 11:34  The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the
 Hararite,

CH1 11:35  Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,

CH1 11:36  Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

CH1 11:37  Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,

CH1 11:38  Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,

CH1 11:39  Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab
 the son of Zeruiah,

CH1 11:40  Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

CH1 11:41  Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

CH1 11:42  Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the
 Reubenites, and thirty with him,

CH1 11:43  Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,

CH1 11:44  Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the
 Aroerite,

CH1 11:45  Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,

CH1 11:46  Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of
 Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

CH1 11:47  Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.

CH1 12:1  Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept
 himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty
 men, helpers of the war.

CH1 12:2  They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the
 left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's
 brethren of Benjamin.

CH1 12:3  The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
 Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and
 Jehu the Antothite.

CH1 12:4  And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over
 the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the
 Gederathite,

CH1 12:5  Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the
 Haruphite,

CH1 12:6  Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the
 Korhites,

CH1 12:7  And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

CH1 12:8  And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the
 hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that
 could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions,
 and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;

CH1 12:9  Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

CH1 12:10  Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

CH1 12:11  Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

CH1 12:12  Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

CH1 12:13  Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.

CH1 12:14  These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the
 least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.

CH1 12:15  These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had
 overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both
 toward the east, and toward the west.

CH1 12:16  And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold
 unto David.

CH1 12:17  And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If
 ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you:
 but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in
 mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.

CH1 12:18  Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and
 he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace,
 peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee.
 Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.

CH1 12:19  And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the
 Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords
 of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his
 master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.

CH1 12:20  As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and
 Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai,
 captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.

CH1 12:21  And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were
 all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.

CH1 12:22  For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until
 it was a great host, like the host of God.

CH1 12:23  And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the
 war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him,
 according to the word of the LORD.

CH1 12:24  The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand
 and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.

CH1 12:25  Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven
 thousand and one hundred.

CH1 12:26  Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.

CH1 12:27  And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were
 three thousand and seven hundred;

CH1 12:28  And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house
 twenty and two captains.

CH1 12:29  And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
 thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the
 house of Saul.

CH1 12:30  And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred,
 mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.

CH1 12:31  And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were
 expressed by name, to come and make David king.

CH1 12:32  And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had
 understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads
 of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.

CH1 12:33  Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all
 instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of
 double heart.

CH1 12:34  And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and
 spear thirty and seven thousand.

CH1 12:35  And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six
 hundred.

CH1 12:36  And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty
 thousand.

CH1 12:37  And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the
 Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of
 war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.

CH1 12:38  All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect
 heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of
 Israel were of one heart to make David king.

CH1 12:39  And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for
 their brethren had prepared for them.

CH1 12:40  Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun
 and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on
 oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and
 oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

CH1 13:1  And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and
 with every leader.

CH1 13:2  And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good
 unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our
 brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them
 also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that
 they may gather themselves unto us:

CH1 13:3  And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not
 at it in the days of Saul.

CH1 13:4  And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing
 was right in the eyes of all the people.

CH1 13:5  So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto
 the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.

CH1 13:6  And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to
 Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the
 LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.

CH1 13:7  And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of
 Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

CH1 13:8  And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and
 with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and
 with cymbals, and with trumpets.

CH1 13:9  And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth
 his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

CH1 13:10  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote
 him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.

CH1 13:11  And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon
 Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.

CH1 13:12  And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the
 ark of God home to me?

CH1 13:13  So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David,
 but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

CH1 13:14  And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house
 three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he
 had.

CH1 14:1  Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of
 cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.

CH1 14:2  And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel,
 for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.

CH1 14:3  And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and
 daughters.

CH1 14:4  Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem;
 Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

CH1 14:5  And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

CH1 14:6  And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

CH1 14:7  And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

CH1 14:8  And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all
 Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and
 went out against them.

CH1 14:9  And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of
 Rephaim.

CH1 14:10  And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
 Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said
 unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.

CH1 14:11  So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then
 David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the
 breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place
 Baalperazim.

CH1 14:12  And when they had left their gods there, David gave a
 commandment, and they were burned with fire.

CH1 14:13  And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
 valley.

CH1 14:14  Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not
 up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the
 mulberry trees.

CH1 14:15  And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops
 of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone
 forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.

CH1 14:16  David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host
 of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

CH1 14:17  And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought
 the fear of him upon all nations.

CH1 15:1  And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place
 for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

CH1 15:2  Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites:
 for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto
 him for ever.

CH1 15:3  And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the
 ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.

CH1 15:4  And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

CH1 15:5  Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred
 and twenty:

CH1 15:6  Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred
 and twenty:

CH1 15:7  Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an hundred
 and thirty:

CH1 15:8  Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two
 hundred:

CH1 15:9  Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:

CH1 15:10  Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an
 hundred and twelve.

CH1 15:11  And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the
 Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,

CH1 15:12  And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites:
 sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark
 of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.

CH1 15:13  For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a
 breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.

CH1 15:14  So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the
 ark of the LORD God of Israel.

CH1 15:15  And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
 shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word
 of the LORD.

CH1 15:16  And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
 brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps
 and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.

CH1 15:17  So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren,
 Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan
 the son of Kushaiah;

CH1 15:18  And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah,
 Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and
 Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and
 Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

CH1 15:19  So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound
 with cymbals of brass;

CH1 15:20  And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and
 Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;

CH1 15:21  And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and
 Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.

CH1 15:22  And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed
 about the song, because he was skilful.

CH1 15:23  And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

CH1 15:24  And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
 Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets
 before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

CH1 15:25  So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands,
 went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of
 Obededom with joy.

CH1 15:26  And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark
 of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.

CH1 15:27  And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites
 that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with
 the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.

CH1 15:28  Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with
 shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals,
 making a noise with psalteries and harps.

CH1 15:29  And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came
 to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at a
 window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.

CH1 16:1  So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent
 that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace
 offerings before God.

CH1 16:2  And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and
 the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.

CH1 16:3  And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one
 a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.

CH1 16:4  And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark
 of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:

CH1 16:5  Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and
 Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and
 Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound
 with cymbals;

CH1 16:6  Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually
 before the ark of the covenant of God.

CH1 16:7  Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD
 into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

CH1 16:8  Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds
 among the people.

CH1 16:9  Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous
 works.

CH1 16:10  Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek
 the LORD.

CH1 16:11  Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

CH1 16:12  Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and
 the judgments of his mouth;

CH1 16:13  O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen
 ones.

CH1 16:14  He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

CH1 16:15  Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to
 a thousand generations;

CH1 16:16  Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath
 unto Isaac;

CH1 16:17  And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an
 everlasting covenant,

CH1 16:18  Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your
 inheritance;

CH1 16:19  When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

CH1 16:20  And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to
 another people;

CH1 16:21  He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for
 their sakes,

CH1 16:22  Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

CH1 16:23  Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his
 salvation.

CH1 16:24  Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all
 nations.

CH1 16:25  For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be
 feared above all gods.

CH1 16:26  For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the
 heavens.

CH1 16:27  Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in
 his place.

CH1 16:28  Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD
 glory and strength.

CH1 16:29  Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
 offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.

CH1 16:30  Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that
 it be not moved.

CH1 16:31  Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say
 among the nations, The LORD reigneth.

CH1 16:32  Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
 rejoice, and all that is therein.

CH1 16:33  Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the
 LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.

CH1 16:34  O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth
 for ever.

CH1 16:35  And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
 together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy
 holy name, and glory in thy praise.

CH1 16:36  Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the
 people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

CH1 16:37  So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph
 and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work
 required:

CH1 16:38  And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom
 also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:

CH1 16:39  And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the
 tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,

CH1 16:40  To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt
 offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is
 written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;

CH1 16:41  And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who
 were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy
 endureth for ever;

CH1 16:42  And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those
 that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons
 of Jeduthun were porters.

CH1 16:43  And all the people departed every man to his house: and David
 returned to bless his house.

CH1 17:1  Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to
 Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the
 covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains.

CH1 17:2  Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God
 is with thee.

CH1 17:3  And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to
 Nathan, saying,

CH1 17:4  Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not
 build me an house to dwell in:

CH1 17:5  For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up
 Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one
 tabernacle to another.

CH1 17:6  Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any
 of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have
 ye not built me an house of cedars?

CH1 17:7  Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith
 the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the
 sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:

CH1 17:8  And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have
 cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like
 the name of the great men that are in the earth.

CH1 17:9  Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant
 them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more;
 neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the
 beginning,

CH1 17:10  And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people
 Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee
 that the LORD will build thee an house.

CH1 17:11  And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must
 go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which
 shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.

CH1 17:12  He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.

CH1 17:13  I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my
 mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:

CH1 17:14  But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and
 his throne shall be established for evermore.

CH1 17:15  According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so
 did Nathan speak unto David.

CH1 17:16  And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I,
 O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?

CH1 17:17  And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast
 also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast
 regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.

CH1 17:18  What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for
 thou knowest thy servant.

CH1 17:19  O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart,
 hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.

CH1 17:20  O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside
 thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

CH1 17:21  And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God
 went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and
 terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast
 redeemed out of Egypt?

CH1 17:22  For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and
 thou, LORD, becamest their God.

CH1 17:23  Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning
 thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou
 hast said.

CH1 17:24  Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever,
 saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let
 the house of David thy servant be established before thee.

CH1 17:25  For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him
 an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.

CH1 17:26  And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto
 thy servant:

CH1 17:27  Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant,
 that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall
 be blessed for ever.

CH1 18:1  Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and
 subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.

CH1 18:2  And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and
 brought gifts.

CH1 18:3  And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to
 stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

CH1 18:4  And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand
 horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot
 horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.

CH1 18:5  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of
 Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

CH1 18:6  Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became
 David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David
 whithersoever he went.

CH1 18:7  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
 Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

CH1 18:8  Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought
 David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the
 pillars, and the vessels of brass.

CH1 18:9  Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host
 of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

CH1 18:10  He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his
 welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against
 Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him
 all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.

CH1 18:11  Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and
 the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from
 Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from
 Amalek.

CH1 18:12  Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the
 valley of salt eighteen thousand.

CH1 18:13  And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's
 servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

CH1 18:14  So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice
 among all his people.

CH1 18:15  And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the
 son of Ahilud, recorder.

CH1 18:16  And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were
 the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

CH1 18:17  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the
 Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.

CH1 19:1  Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children
 of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

CH1 19:2  And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash,
 because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to
 comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the
 land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.

CH1 19:3  But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou
 that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee?
 are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to
 spy out the land?

CH1 19:4  Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off
 their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.

CH1 19:5  Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And
 he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said,
 Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

CH1 19:6  And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves
 odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of
 silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of
 Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.

CH1 19:7  So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of
 Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children
 of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.

CH1 19:8  And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
 mighty men.

CH1 19:9  And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
 before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves
 in the field.

CH1 19:10  Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and
 behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array
 against the Syrians.

CH1 19:11  And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his
 brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.

CH1 19:12  And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt
 help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will
 help thee.

CH1 19:13  Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our
 people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good
 in his sight.

CH1 19:14  So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
 Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.

CH1 19:15  And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they
 likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then
 Joab came to Jerusalem.

CH1 19:16  And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before
 Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the
 river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

CH1 19:17  And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over
 Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when
 David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.

CH1 19:18  But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians
 seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and
 killed Shophach the captain of the host.

CH1 19:19  And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the
 worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants:
 neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.

CH1 20:1  And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time
 that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted
 the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David
 tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.

CH1 20:2  And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found
 it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it
 was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out
 of the city.

CH1 20:3  And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with
 saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all
 the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to
 Jerusalem.

CH1 20:4  And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with
 the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was
 of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.

CH1 20:5  And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of
 Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was
 like a weaver's beam.

CH1 20:6  And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great
 stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and
 six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.

CH1 20:7  But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother
 slew him.

CH1 20:8  These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of
 David, and by the hand of his servants.

CH1 21:1  And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number
 Israel.

CH1 21:2  And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number
 Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I
 may know it.

CH1 21:3  And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many
 more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants?
 why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass
 to Israel?

CH1 21:4  Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab
 departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

CH1 21:5  And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all
 they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew
 sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew
 sword.

CH1 21:6  But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word
 was abominable to Joab.

CH1 21:7  And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.

CH1 21:8  And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done
 this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for
 I have done very foolishly.

CH1 21:9  And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,

CH1 21:10  Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three
 things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

CH1 21:11  So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose
 thee

CH1 21:12  Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before
 thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else
 three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the
 angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now
 therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.

CH1 21:13  And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now
 into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not
 fall into the hand of man.

CH1 21:14  So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel
 seventy thousand men.

CH1 21:15  And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was
 destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the
 angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the
 LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

CH1 21:16  And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand
 between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched
 out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in
 sackcloth, fell upon their faces.

CH1 21:17  And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be
 numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for
 these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God,
 be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should
 be plagued.

CH1 21:18  Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David
 should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of
 Ornan the Jebusite.

CH1 21:19  And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name
 of the LORD.

CH1 21:20  And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him
 hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

CH1 21:21  And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out
 of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the
 ground.

CH1 21:22  Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor,
 that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for
 the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.

CH1 21:23  And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king
 do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt
 offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat
 offering; I give it all.

CH1 21:24  And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the
 full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer
 burnt offerings without cost.

CH1 21:25  So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by
 weight.

CH1 21:26  And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
 offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him
 from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.

CH1 21:27  And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into
 the sheath thereof.

CH1 21:28  At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the
 threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

CH1 21:29  For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the
 wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the
 high place at Gibeon.

CH1 21:30  But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
 afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

CH1 22:1  Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the
 altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

CH1 22:2  And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the
 land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of
 God.

CH1 22:3  And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors
 of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;

CH1 22:4  Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre
 brought much cedar wood to David.

CH1 22:5  And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house
 that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and
 of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for
 it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.

CH1 22:6  Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house
 for the LORD God of Israel.

CH1 22:7  And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to
 build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:

CH1 22:8  But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood
 abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my
 name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.

CH1 22:9  Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and
 I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be
 Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.

CH1 22:10  He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I
 will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over
 Israel for ever.

CH1 22:11  Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the
 house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.

CH1 22:12  Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee
 charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.

CH1 22:13  Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes
 and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be
 strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.

CH1 22:14  Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD
 an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of
 silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber
 also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.

CH1 22:15  Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
 workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner
 of work.

CH1 22:16  Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no
 number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.

CH1 22:17  David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his
 son, saying,

CH1 22:18  Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on
 every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and
 the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.

CH1 22:19  Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise
 therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark
 of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that
 is to be built to the name of the LORD.

CH1 23:1  So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king
 over Israel.

CH1 23:2  And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests
 and the Levites.

CH1 23:3  Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
 upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight
 thousand.

CH1 23:4  Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work
 of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:

CH1 23:5  Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the
 LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.

CH1 23:6  And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely,
 Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

CH1 23:7  Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.

CH1 23:8  The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel,
 three.

CH1 23:9  The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These
 were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.

CH1 23:10  And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah.
 These four were the sons of Shimei.

CH1 23:11  And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah
 had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their
 father's house.

CH1 23:12  The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

CH1 23:13  The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he
 should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn
 incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for
 ever.

CH1 23:14  Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the
 tribe of Levi.

CH1 23:15  The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.

CH1 23:16  Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

CH1 23:17  And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had
 none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

CH1 23:18  Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

CH1 23:19  Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
 Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

CH1 23:20  Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.

CH1 23:21  The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;
 Eleazar, and Kish.

CH1 23:22  And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren
 the sons of Kish took them.

CH1 23:23  The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

CH1 23:24  These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even
 the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their
 polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the
 age of twenty years and upward.

CH1 23:25  For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his
 people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:

CH1 23:26  And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle,
 nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.

CH1 23:27  For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty
 years old and above:

CH1 23:28  Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the
 service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and
 in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house
 of God;

CH1 23:29  Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat
 offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the
 pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;

CH1 23:30  And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and
 likewise at even:

CH1 23:31  And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths,
 in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order
 commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:

CH1 23:32  And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
 congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of
 Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.

CH1 24:1  Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron;
 Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

CH1 24:2  But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children:
 therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.

CH1 24:3  And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and
 Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their
 service.

CH1 24:4  And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than
 of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar
 there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among
 the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.

CH1 24:5  Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
 governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the
 sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

CH1 24:6  And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites,
 wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and
 Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the
 priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one
 taken for Ithamar.

CH1 24:7  Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

CH1 24:8  The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

CH1 24:9  The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

CH1 24:10  The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,

CH1 24:11  The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah,

CH1 24:12  The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,

CH1 24:13  The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

CH1 24:14  The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

CH1 24:15  The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,

CH1 24:16  The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,

CH1 24:17  The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,

CH1 24:18  The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to
 Maaziah.

CH1 24:19  These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the
 house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as
 the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.

CH1 24:20  And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram;
 Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

CH1 24:21  Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.

CH1 24:22  Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.

CH1 24:23  And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
 Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

CH1 24:24  Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.

CH1 24:25  The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;
 Zechariah.

CH1 24:26  The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.

CH1 24:27  The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and
 Ibri.

CH1 24:28  Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

CH1 24:29  Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.

CH1 24:30  The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were
 the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.

CH1 24:31  These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of
 Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the
 chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers
 over against their younger brethren.

CH1 25:1  Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service
 of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with
 harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen
 according to their service was:

CH1 25:2  Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and
 Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied
 according to the order of the king.

CH1 25:3  Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah,
 Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who
 prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD.

CH1 25:4  Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and
 Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer,
 Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:

CH1 25:5  All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God,
 to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.

CH1 25:6  All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house
 of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the
 house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

CH1 25:7  So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed
 in the songs of the LORD, even all that were cunning, was two hundred
 fourscore and eight.

CH1 25:8  And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the
 great, the teacher as the scholar.

CH1 25:9  Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to
 Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:

CH1 25:10  The third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

CH1 25:14  The seventh to Jesharelah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
 twelve:

CH1 25:15  The eighth to Jeshaiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

CH1 25:16  The ninth to Mattaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

CH1 25:17  The tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

CH1 25:18  The eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
 twelve:

CH1 25:19  The twelfth to Hashabiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
 twelve:

CH1 25:20  The thirteenth to Shubael, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
 twelve:

CH1 25:21  The fourteenth to Mattithiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
 twelve:

CH1 25:22  The fifteenth to Jeremoth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
 twelve:

CH1 25:23  The sixteenth to Hananiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
 twelve:

CH1 25:24  The seventeenth to Joshbekashah, he, his sons, and his brethren,
 were twelve:

 were twelve:

 brethren, were twelve:

CH1 25:31  The four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, he, his sons, and his
 brethren, were twelve.

CH1 26:1  Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was
 Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

CH1 26:2  And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael
 the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

CH1 26:3  Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.

CH1 26:4  Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad
 the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.

CH1 26:5  Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for God
 blessed him.

CH1 26:6  Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the
 house of their father: for they were mighty men of valour.

CH1 26:7  The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose
 brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

CH1 26:8  All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and their
 brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and two of
 Obededom.

CH1 26:9  And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.

CH1 26:10  Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief,
 (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)

CH1 26:11  Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all
 the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

CH1 26:12  Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief
 men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD.

CH1 26:13  And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the
 house of their fathers, for every gate.

CH1 26:14  And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son,
 a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.

CH1 26:15  To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.

CH1 26:16  To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate
 Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.

CH1 26:17  Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a
 day, and toward Asuppim two and two.

CH1 26:18  At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

CH1 26:19  These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore, and
 among the sons of Merari.

CH1 26:20  And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of
 God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.

CH1 26:21  As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite Laadan,
 chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were Jehieli.

CH1 26:22  The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were over
 the treasures of the house of the LORD.

CH1 26:23  Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the
 Uzzielites:

CH1 26:24  And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the
 treasures.

CH1 26:25  And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his
 son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.

CH1 26:26  Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the
 dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains
 over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated.

CH1 26:27  Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the
 house of the LORD.

CH1 26:28  And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner
 the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whosoever had
 dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.

CH1 26:29  Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward
 business over Israel, for officers and judges.

CH1 26:30  And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a
 thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this side
 Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the
 king.

CH1 26:31  Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the
 Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year
 of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them
 mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead.

CH1 26:32  And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred
 chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the
 Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to
 God, and affairs of the king.

CH1 27:1  Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief
 fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that
 served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out
 month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were
 twenty and four thousand.

CH1 27:2  Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of
 Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

CH1 27:3  Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the
 host for the first month.

CH1 27:4  And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of
 his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course likewise were twenty and
 four thousand.

CH1 27:5  The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son
 of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

CH1 27:6  This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and above the
 thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son.

CH1 27:7  The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of
 Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course were twenty and four
 thousand.

CH1 27:8  The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and
 in his course were twenty and four thousand.

CH1 27:9  The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the
 Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

CH1 27:10  The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite,
 of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

CH1 27:11  The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite,
 of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

CH1 27:12  The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anetothite,
 of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

CH1 27:13  The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite,
 of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

CH1 27:14  The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the
 Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and
 four thousand.

CH1 27:15  The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the
 Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

CH1 27:16  Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites
 was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of
 Maachah:

CH1 27:17  Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites,
 Zadok:

CH1 27:18  Of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of David: of Issachar, Omri the
 son of Michael:

CH1 27:19  Of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jerimoth the
 son of Azriel:

CH1 27:20  Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the half
 tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:

CH1 27:21  Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah:
 of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:

CH1 27:22  Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the
 tribes of Israel.

CH1 27:23  But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and
 under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars
 of the heavens.

CH1 27:24  Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,
 because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put
 in the account of the chronicles of king David.

CH1 27:25  And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and
 over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and
 in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah:

CH1 27:26  And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the
 ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

CH1 27:27  And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase
 of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:

CH1 27:28  And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low
 plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash:

CH1 27:29  And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and
 over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai:

CH1 27:30  Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was
 Jehdeiah the Meronothite:

CH1 27:31  And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the
 rulers of the substance which was king David's.

CH1 27:32  Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a
 scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons:

CH1 27:33  And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was
 the king's companion:

CH1 27:34  And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar:
 and the general of the king's army was Joab.

CH1 28:1  And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the
 tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by
 course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds,
 and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of
 his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the
 valiant men, unto Jerusalem.

CH1 28:2  Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my
 brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of
 rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our
 God, and had made ready for the building:

CH1 28:3  But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name,
 because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.

CH1 28:4  Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my
 father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the
 ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons
 of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:

CH1 28:5  And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath
 chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over
 Israel.

CH1 28:6  And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my
 courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.

CH1 28:7  Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to
 do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.

CH1 28:8  Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the
 LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments
 of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an
 inheritance for your children after you for ever.

CH1 28:9  And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve
 him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all
 hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek
 him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
 for ever.

CH1 28:10  Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for
 the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

CH1 28:11  Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and
 of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper
 chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the
 mercy seat,

CH1 28:12  And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts
 of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the
 treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated
 things:

CH1 28:13  Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the
 work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of
 service in the house of the LORD.

CH1 28:14  He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of
 all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight,
 for all instruments of every kind of service:

CH1 28:15  Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of
 gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the
 candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the
 lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.

CH1 28:16  And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every
 table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:

CH1 28:17  Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and
 for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise
 silver by weight for every bason of silver:

CH1 28:18  And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for
 the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and
 covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

CH1 28:19  All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his
 hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.

CH1 28:20  And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
 courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God,
 will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast
 finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.

CH1 28:21  And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they
 shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall
 be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any
 manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy
 commandment.

CH1 29:1  Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my
 son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is
 great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.

CH1 29:2  Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the
 gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and
 the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for
 things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of
 divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in
 abundance.

CH1 29:3  Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I
 have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the
 house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.

CH1 29:4  Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven
 thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses
 withal:

CH1 29:5  The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and
 for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is
 willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?

CH1 29:6  Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and
 the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's
 work, offered willingly,

CH1 29:7  And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand
 talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of
 brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.

CH1 29:8  And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
 treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.

CH1 29:9  Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because
 with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king
 also rejoiced with great joy.

CH1 29:10  Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and
 David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and
 ever.

CH1 29:11  Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and
 the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth
 is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above
 all.

CH1 29:12  Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and
 in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and
 to give strength unto all.

CH1 29:13  Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.

CH1 29:14  But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer
 so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own
 have we given thee.

CH1 29:15  For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our
 fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.

CH1 29:16  O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee
 an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.

CH1 29:17  I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure
 in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly
 offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are
 present here, to offer willingly unto thee.

CH1 29:18  O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this
 for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and
 prepare their heart unto thee:

CH1 29:19  And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy
 commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things,
 and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.

CH1 29:20  And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God.
 And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed
 down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.

CH1 29:21  And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt
 offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand
 bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings,
 and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:

CH1 29:22  And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great
 gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and
 anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.

CH1 29:23  Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David
 his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

CH1 29:24  And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise
 of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.

CH1 29:25  And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
 Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king
 before him in Israel.

CH1 29:26  Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

CH1 29:27  And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven
 years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in
 Jerusalem.

CH1 29:28  And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and
 Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

CH1 29:29  Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are
 written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the
 prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

CH1 29:30  With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over
 him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

CH2 1:1  And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the
 LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.

CH2 1:2  Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and
 of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the
 chief of the fathers.

CH2 1:3  So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place
 that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God,
 which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.

CH2 1:4  But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the
 place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at
 Jerusalem.

CH2 1:5  Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
 Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the
 congregation sought unto it.

CH2 1:6  And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which
 was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt
 offerings upon it.

CH2 1:7  In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what
 I shall give thee.

CH2 1:8  And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my
 father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.

CH2 1:9  Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established:
 for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in
 multitude.

CH2 1:10  Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in
 before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?

CH2 1:11  And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou
 hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies,
 neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for
 thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:

CH2 1:12  Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee
 riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have
 been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.

CH2 1:13  Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at
 Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and
 reigned over Israel.

CH2 1:14  And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and
 four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the
 chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

CH2 1:15  And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
 stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale
 for abundance.

CH2 1:16  And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
 king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

CH2 1:17  And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six
 hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so
 brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings
 of Syria, by their means.

CH2 2:1  And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and
 an house for his kingdom.

CH2 2:2  And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens,
 and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six
 hundred to oversee them.

CH2 2:3  And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal
 with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to
 dwell therein, even so deal with me.

CH2 2:4  Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate
 it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual
 shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths,
 and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is
 an ordinance for ever to Israel.

CH2 2:5  And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all
 gods.

CH2 2:6  But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of
 heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house,
 save only to burn sacrifice before him?

CH2 2:7  Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in
 silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and
 that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in
 Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.

CH2 2:8  Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon:
 for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold,
 my servants shall be with thy servants,

CH2 2:9  Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about
 to build shall be wonderful great.

CH2 2:10  And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber,
 twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of
 barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

CH2 2:11  Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to
 Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over
 them.

CH2 2:12  Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made
 heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with
 prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an
 house for his kingdom.

CH2 2:13  And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of
 Huram my father's,

CH2 2:14  The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man
 of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in
 stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson;
 also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall
 be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord
 David thy father.

CH2 2:15  Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which
 my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:

CH2 2:16  And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and
 we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it
 up to Jerusalem.

CH2 2:17  And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of
 Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and
 they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six
 hundred.

CH2 2:18  And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of
 burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three
 thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.

CH2 3:1  Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in
 mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place
 that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

CH2 3:2  And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the
 fourth year of his reign.

CH2 3:3  Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the
 building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure
 was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.

CH2 3:4  And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was
 according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an
 hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.

CH2 3:5  And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with
 fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.

CH2 3:6  And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the
 gold was gold of Parvaim.

CH2 3:7  He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls
 thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.

CH2 3:8  And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according
 to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty
 cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.

CH2 3:9  And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid
 the upper chambers with gold.

CH2 3:10  And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and
 overlaid them with gold.

CH2 3:11  And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing
 of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the
 other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other
 cherub.

CH2 3:12  And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the
 wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the
 wing of the other cherub.

CH2 3:13  The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits:
 and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.

CH2 3:14  And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine
 linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

CH2 3:15  Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits
 high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.

CH2 3:16  And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads
 of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.

CH2 3:17  And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right
 hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right
 hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.

CH2 4:1  Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
 thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height
 thereof.

CH2 4:2  Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in
 compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did
 compass it round about.

CH2 4:3  And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round
 about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were
 cast, when it was cast.

CH2 4:4  It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three
 looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three
 looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their
 hinder parts were inward.

CH2 4:5  And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like
 the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and
 held three thousand baths.

CH2 4:6  He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on
 the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering
 they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.

CH2 4:7  And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set
 them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.

CH2 4:8  He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the
 right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.

CH2 4:9  Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and
 doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.

CH2 4:10  And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against
 the south.

CH2 4:11  And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram
 finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;

CH2 4:12  To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which
 were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two
 pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;

CH2 4:13  And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of
 pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which
 were upon the pillars.

CH2 4:14  He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;

CH2 4:15  One sea, and twelve oxen under it.

CH2 4:16  The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their
 instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the
 LORD of bright brass.

CH2 4:17  In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
 between Succoth and Zeredathah.

CH2 4:18  Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the
 weight of the brass could not be found out.

CH2 4:19  And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the
 golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;

CH2 4:20  Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn
 after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;

CH2 4:21  And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and
 that perfect gold;

CH2 4:22  And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of
 pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most
 holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.

CH2 5:1  Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was
 finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had
 dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he
 among the treasures of the house of God.

CH2 5:2  Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
 tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem,
 to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David,
 which is Zion.

CH2 5:3  Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king
 in the feast which was in the seventh month.

CH2 5:4  And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.

CH2 5:5  And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
 congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did
 the priests and the Levites bring up.

CH2 5:6  Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were
 assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not
 be told nor numbered for multitude.

CH2 5:7  And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto
 his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under
 the wings of the cherubims:

CH2 5:8  For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the
 ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.

CH2 5:9  And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves
 were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And
 there it is unto this day.

CH2 5:10  There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put
 therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel,
 when they came out of Egypt.

CH2 5:11  And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
 place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not
 then wait by course:

CH2 5:12  Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of
 Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in
 white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end
 of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with
 trumpets:)

CH2 5:13  It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to
 make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they
 lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of
 musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth
 for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the
 LORD;

CH2 5:14  So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the
 cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.

CH2 6:1  Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick
 darkness.

CH2 6:2  But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy
 dwelling for ever.

CH2 6:3  And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of
 Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.

CH2 6:4  And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his
 hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David,
 saying,

CH2 6:5  Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt
 I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my
 name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people
 Israel:

CH2 6:6  But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have
 chosen David to be over my people Israel.

CH2 6:7  Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the
 name of the LORD God of Israel.

CH2 6:8  But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine
 heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine
 heart:

CH2 6:9  Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which
 shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.

CH2 6:10  The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I
 am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of
 Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the
 LORD God of Israel.

CH2 6:11  And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD,
 that he made with the children of Israel.

CH2 6:12  And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the
 congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:

CH2 6:13  For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long, and five
 cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the
 court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the
 congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.

CH2 6:14  And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the
 heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy unto thy
 servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:

CH2 6:15  Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou
 hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with
 thine hand, as it is this day.

CH2 6:16  Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my
 father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a
 man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children
 take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.

CH2 6:17  Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou
 hast spoken unto thy servant David.

CH2 6:18  But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven
 and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which
 I have built!

CH2 6:19  Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his
 supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy
 servant prayeth before thee:

CH2 6:20  That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the
 place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to
 hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.

CH2 6:21  Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy
 people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy
 dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.

CH2 6:22  If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to
 make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;

CH2 6:23  Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
 requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by
 justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.

CH2 6:24  And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
 because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy
 name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;

CH2 6:25  Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people
 Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and
 to their fathers.

CH2 6:26  When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
 sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy
 name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;

CH2 6:27  Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and
 of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they
 should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy
 people for an inheritance.

CH2 6:28  If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be
 blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them
 in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:

CH2 6:29  Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any
 man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and
 his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:

CH2 6:30  Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and
 render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest;
 (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)

CH2 6:31  That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live
 in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

CH2 6:32  Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel,
 but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty
 hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;

CH2 6:33  Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do
 according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people
 of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and
 may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.

CH2 6:34  If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that
 thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou
 hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;

CH2 6:35  Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their
 supplication, and maintain their cause.

CH2 6:36  If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,)
 and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and
 they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;

CH2 6:37  Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried
 captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying,
 We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;

CH2 6:38  If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul
 in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and
 pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the
 city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy
 name:

CH2 6:39  Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their
 prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy
 people which have sinned against thee.

CH2 6:40  Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine
 ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.

CH2 6:41  Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and
 the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with
 salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.

CH2 6:42  O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the
 mercies of David thy servant.

CH2 7:1  Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from
 heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory
 of the LORD filled the house.

CH2 7:2  And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because
 the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.

CH2 7:3  And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and
 the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces
 to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD,
 saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.

CH2 7:4  Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.

CH2 7:5  And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand
 oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the
 people dedicated the house of God.

CH2 7:6  And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
 instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise
 the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their
 ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.

CH2 7:7  Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the
 house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the
 peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able
 to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.

CH2 7:8  Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all
 Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath
 unto the river of Egypt.

CH2 7:9  And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the
 dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.

CH2 7:10  And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the
 people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that
 the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.

CH2 7:11  Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house:
 and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and
 in his own house, he prosperously effected.

CH2 7:12  And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have
 heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of
 sacrifice.

CH2 7:13  If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
 locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;

CH2 7:14  If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
 and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear
 from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

CH2 7:15  Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer
 that is made in this place.

CH2 7:16  For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be
 there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

CH2 7:17  And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father
 walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe
 my statutes and my judgments;

CH2 7:18  Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have
 covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to
 be ruler in Israel.

CH2 7:19  But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments,
 which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship
 them;

CH2 7:20  Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have
 given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast
 out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all
 nations.

CH2 7:21  And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one
 that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto
 this land, and unto this house?

CH2 7:22  And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their
 fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on
 other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought
 all this evil upon them.

CH2 8:1  And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had
 built the house of the LORD, and his own house,

CH2 8:2  That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built
 them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.

CH2 8:3  And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.

CH2 8:4  And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which
 he built in Hamath.

CH2 8:5  Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced
 cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

CH2 8:6  And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the
 chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired
 to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his
 dominion.

CH2 8:7  As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
 Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were
 not of Israel,

CH2 8:8  But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the
 children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until
 this day.

CH2 8:9  But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his
 work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of
 his chariots and horsemen.

CH2 8:10  And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred
 and fifty, that bare rule over the people.

CH2 8:11  And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of
 David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall
 not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy,
 whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.

CH2 8:12  Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar
 of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,

CH2 8:13  Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the
 commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the
 solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened
 bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.

CH2 8:14  And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the
 courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to
 praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required:
 the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of
 God commanded.

CH2 8:15  And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the
 priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.

CH2 8:16  Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
 foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house
 of the LORD was perfected.

CH2 8:17  Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the
 land of Edom.

CH2 8:18  And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants
 that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to
 Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought
 them to king Solomon.

CH2 9:1  And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to
 prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great
 company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious
 stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that
 was in her heart.

CH2 9:2  And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from
 Solomon which he told her not.

CH2 9:3  And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the
 house that he had built,

CH2 9:4  And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the
 attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and
 their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD;
 there was no more spirit in her.

CH2 9:5  And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine
 own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

CH2 9:6  Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had
 seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not
 told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.

CH2 9:7  Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand
 continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

CH2 9:8  Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on
 his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to
 establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do
 judgment and justice.

CH2 9:9  And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of
 spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice
 as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.

CH2 9:10  And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which
 brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.

CH2 9:11  And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the
 LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and
 there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.

CH2 9:12  And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
 whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she
 turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.

CH2 9:13  Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
 hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

CH2 9:14  Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of
 Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.

CH2 9:15  And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred
 shekels of beaten gold went to one target.

CH2 9:16  And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred
 shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the
 forest of Lebanon.

CH2 9:17  Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with
 pure gold.

CH2 9:18  And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,
 which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting
 place, and two lions standing by the stays:

CH2 9:19  And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon
 the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.

CH2 9:20  And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all
 the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none
 were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.

CH2 9:21  For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:
 every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver,
 ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

CH2 9:22  And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and
 wisdom.

CH2 9:23  And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to
 hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.

CH2 9:24  And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
 vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate
 year by year.

CH2 9:25  And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and
 twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with
 the king at Jerusalem.

CH2 9:26  And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land
 of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

CH2 9:27  And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made
 he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.

CH2 9:28  And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all
 lands.

CH2 9:29  Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not
 written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the
 Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of
 Nebat?

CH2 9:30  And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

CH2 9:31  And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of
 David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

CH2 10:1  And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to
 make him king.

CH2 10:2  And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in
 Egypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that
 Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

CH2 10:3  And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and
 spake to Rehoboam, saying,

CH2 10:4  Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat
 the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us,
 and we will serve thee.

CH2 10:5  And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the
 people departed.

CH2 10:6  And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before
 Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to
 return answer to this people?

CH2 10:7  And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and
 please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for
 ever.

CH2 10:8  But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took
 counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before
 him.

CH2 10:9  And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer
 to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that
 thy father did put upon us?

CH2 10:10  And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him,
 saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy
 father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus
 shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's
 loins.

CH2 10:11  For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to
 your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with
 scorpions.

CH2 10:12  So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as
 the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.

CH2 10:13  And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the
 counsel of the old men,

CH2 10:14  And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My
 father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you
 with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

CH2 10:15  So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God,
 that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah
 the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

CH2 10:16  And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
 them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?
 and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O
 Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their
 tents.

CH2 10:17  But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah,
 Rehoboam reigned over them.

CH2 10:18  Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the
 children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam
 made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

CH2 10:19  And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

CH2 11:1  And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of
 Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were
 warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to
 Rehoboam.

CH2 11:2  But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

CH2 11:3  Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all
 Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

CH2 11:4  Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your
 brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And
 they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.

CH2 11:5  And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in
 Judah.

CH2 11:6  He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

CH2 11:7  And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,

CH2 11:8  And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

CH2 11:9  And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

CH2 11:10  And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in
 Benjamin fenced cities.

CH2 11:11  And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and
 store of victual, and of oil and wine.

CH2 11:12  And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them
 exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.

CH2 11:13  And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to
 him out of all their coasts.

CH2 11:14  For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to
 Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from
 executing the priest's office unto the LORD:

CH2 11:15  And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils,
 and for the calves which he had made.

CH2 11:16  And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their
 hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto
 the LORD God of their fathers.

CH2 11:17  So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son
 of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of
 David and Solomon.

CH2 11:18  And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of
 David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;

CH2 11:19  Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.

CH2 11:20  And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare
 him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.

CH2 11:21  And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his
 wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore
 concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)

CH2 11:22  And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler
 among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.

CH2 11:23  And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout
 all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave
 them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.

CH2 12:1  And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and
 had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with
 him.

CH2 12:2  And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak
 king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed
 against the LORD,

CH2 12:3  With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and
 the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims,
 the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.

CH2 12:4  And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to
 Jerusalem.

CH2 12:5  Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of
 Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said
 unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I
 also left you in the hand of Shishak.

CH2 12:6  Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and
 they said, The LORD is righteous.

CH2 12:7  And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the
 LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will
 not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall
 not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

CH2 12:8  Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
 service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

CH2 12:9  So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the
 treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he
 took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

CH2 12:10  Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed
 them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the
 king's house.

CH2 12:11  And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came
 and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.

CH2 12:12  And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him,
 that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.

CH2 12:13  So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for
 Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
 seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all
 the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah
 an Ammonitess.

CH2 12:14  And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.

CH2 12:15  Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
 in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning
 genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.

CH2 12:16  And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
 David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

CH2 13:1  Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign
 over Judah.

CH2 13:2  He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
 Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah
 and Jeroboam.

CH2 13:3  And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of
 war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in
 array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of
 valour.

CH2 13:4  And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
 Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;

CH2 13:5  Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom
 over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of
 salt?

CH2 13:6  Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of
 David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.

CH2 13:7  And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and
 have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when
 Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.

CH2 13:8  And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand
 of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with your
 golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.

CH2 13:9  Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and
 the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of
 other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young
 bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.

CH2 13:10  But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him;
 and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the
 Levites wait upon their business:

CH2 13:11  And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt
 sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the
 pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every
 evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken
 him.

CH2 13:12  And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests
 with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight
 ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.

CH2 13:13  But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they
 were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.

CH2 13:14  And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
 behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the
 trumpets.

CH2 13:15  Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted,
 it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and
 Judah.

CH2 13:16  And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them
 into their hand.

CH2 13:17  And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there
 fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.

CH2 13:18  Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the
 children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their
 fathers.

CH2 13:19  And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel
 with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with
 the towns thereof.

CH2 13:20  Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah:
 and the LORD struck him, and he died.

CH2 13:21  But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
 twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

CH2 13:22  And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings,
 are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

CH2 14:1  So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of
 David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet
 ten years.

CH2 14:2  And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his
 God:

CH2 14:3  For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places,
 and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:

CH2 14:4  And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do
 the law and the commandment.

CH2 14:5  Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and
 the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.

CH2 14:6  And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he
 had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.

CH2 14:7  Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make
 about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before
 us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath
 given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.

CH2 14:8  And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah
 three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows,
 two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.

CH2 14:9  And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a
 thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.

CH2 14:10  Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array
 in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

CH2 14:11  And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing
 with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help
 us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this
 multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.

CH2 14:12  So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and
 the Ethiopians fled.

CH2 14:13  And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar:
 and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves;
 for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they
 carried away very much spoil.

CH2 14:14  And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the
 LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding
 much spoil in them.

CH2 14:15  They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and
 camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

CH2 15:1  And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

CH2 15:2  And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and
 all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye
 seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake
 you.

CH2 15:3  Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and
 without a teaching priest, and without law.

CH2 15:4  But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of
 Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.

CH2 15:5  And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to
 him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the
 countries.

CH2 15:6  And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex
 them with all adversity.

CH2 15:7  Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work
 shall be rewarded.

CH2 15:8  And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet,
 he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of
 Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount
 Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the
 LORD.

CH2 15:9  And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them
 out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of
 Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.

CH2 15:10  So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
 month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

CH2 15:11  And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which
 they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.

CH2 15:12  And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their
 fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

CH2 15:13  That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put
 to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

CH2 15:14  And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with
 shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.

CH2 15:15  And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all
 their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found
 of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.

CH2 15:16  And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed
 her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut
 down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.

CH2 15:17  But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless
 the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

CH2 15:18  And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had
 dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.

CH2 15:19  And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the
 reign of Asa.

CH2 16:1  In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of
 Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might
 let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

CH2 16:2  Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the
 house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of
 Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

CH2 16:3  There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father
 and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy
 league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.

CH2 16:4  And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his
 armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and
 Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

CH2 16:5  And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building
 of Ramah, and let his work cease.

CH2 16:6  Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of
 Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built
 therewith Geba and Mizpah.

CH2 16:7  And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said
 unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on
 the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of
 thine hand.

CH2 16:8  Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many
 chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered
 them into thine hand.

CH2 16:9  For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth,
 to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward
 him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt
 have wars.

CH2 16:10  Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for
 he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some
 of the people the same time.

CH2 16:11  And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written
 in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

CH2 16:12  And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in
 his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought
 not to the LORD, but to the physicians.

CH2 16:13  And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth
 year of his reign.

CH2 16:14  And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for
 himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with
 sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art:
 and they made a very great burning for him.

CH2 17:1  And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
 himself against Israel.

CH2 17:2  And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set
 garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his
 father had taken.

CH2 17:3  And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first
 ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;

CH2 17:4  But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his
 commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

CH2 17:5  Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah
 brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.

CH2 17:6  And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took
 away the high places and groves out of Judah.

CH2 17:7  Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to
 Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah,
 to teach in the cities of Judah.

CH2 17:8  And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and
 Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and
 Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram,
 priests.

CH2 17:9  And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD
 with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the
 people.

CH2 17:10  And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
 that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.

CH2 17:11  Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
 tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven
 hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.

CH2 17:12  And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
 castles, and cities of store.

CH2 17:13  And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war,
 mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.

CH2 17:14  And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their
 fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him
 mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.

CH2 17:15  And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred
 and fourscore thousand.

CH2 17:16  And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered
 himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of
 valour.

CH2 17:17  And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed
 men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.

CH2 17:18  And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore
 thousand ready prepared for the war.

CH2 17:19  These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the
 fenced cities throughout all Judah.

CH2 18:1  Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
 affinity with Ahab.

CH2 18:2  And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab
 killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had
 with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.

CH2 18:3  And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt
 thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and
 my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.

CH2 18:4  And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee,
 at the word of the LORD to day.

CH2 18:5  Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four
 hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or
 shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the
 king's hand.

CH2 18:6  But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
 besides, that we might enquire of him?

CH2 18:7  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man,
 by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied
 good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And
 Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

CH2 18:8  And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said,
 Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

CH2 18:9  And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either
 of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place
 at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied
 before them.

CH2 18:10  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and
 said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be
 consumed.

CH2 18:11  And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
 Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the
 king.

CH2 18:12  And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying,
 Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent;
 let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of their's, and speak thou
 good.

CH2 18:13  And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that
 will I speak.

CH2 18:14  And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah,
 shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye
 up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.

CH2 18:15  And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that
 thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?

CH2 18:16  Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as
 sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let
 them return therefore every man to his house in peace.

CH2 18:17  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that
 he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?

CH2 18:18  Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD
 sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right
 hand and on his left.

CH2 18:19  And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may
 go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and
 another saying after that manner.

CH2 18:20  Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I
 will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?

CH2 18:21  And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of
 all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt
 also prevail: go out, and do even so.

CH2 18:22  Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth
 of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.

CH2 18:23  Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon
 the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak
 unto thee?

CH2 18:24  And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt
 go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

CH2 18:25  Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to
 Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;

CH2 18:26  And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and
 feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I
 return in peace.

CH2 18:27  And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not
 the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.

CH2 18:28  So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to
 Ramothgilead.

CH2 18:29  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
 myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king
 of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.

CH2 18:30  Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
 that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with
 the king of Israel.

CH2 18:31  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
 Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they
 compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped
 him; and God moved them to depart from him.

CH2 18:32  For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
 perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from
 pursuing him.

CH2 18:33  And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
 Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot
 man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am
 wounded.

CH2 18:34  And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed
 himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the
 time of the sun going down he died.

CH2 19:1  And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to
 Jerusalem.

CH2 19:2  And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to
 king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate
 the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD.

CH2 19:3  Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast
 taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek
 God.

CH2 19:4  And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the
 people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD
 God of their fathers.

CH2 19:5  And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of
 Judah, city by city,

CH2 19:6  And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for
 man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.

CH2 19:7  Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do
 it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons,
 nor taking of gifts.

CH2 19:8  Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the
 priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the
 LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.

CH2 19:9  And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the
 LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

CH2 19:10  And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell
 in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment,
 statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not
 against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this
 do, and ye shall not trespass.

CH2 19:11  And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters
 of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of
 Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before
 you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good.

CH2 20:1  It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the
 children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against
 Jehoshaphat to battle.

CH2 20:2  Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a
 great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and,
 behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi.

CH2 20:3  And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and
 proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

CH2 20:4  And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even
 out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.

CH2 20:5  And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem,
 in the house of the LORD, before the new court,

CH2 20:6  And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and
 rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is
 there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?

CH2 20:7  Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this
 land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy
 friend for ever?

CH2 20:8  And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for
 thy name, saying,

CH2 20:9  If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence,
 or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is
 in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and
 help.

CH2 20:10  And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom
 thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt,
 but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;

CH2 20:11  Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy
 possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

CH2 20:12  O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against
 this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but
 our eyes are upon thee.

CH2 20:13  And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their
 wives, and their children.

CH2 20:14  Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son
 of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the
 Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;

CH2 20:15  And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of
 Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not
 afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not
 yours, but God's.

CH2 20:16  To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff
 of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness
 of Jeruel.

CH2 20:17  Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye
 still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem:
 fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will
 be with you.

CH2 20:18  And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all
 Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the
 LORD.

CH2 20:19  And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
 children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a
 loud voice on high.

CH2 20:20  And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
 wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear
 me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God,
 so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.

CH2 20:21  And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto
 the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out
 before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for
 ever.

CH2 20:22  And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments
 against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against
 Judah; and they were smitten.

CH2 20:23  For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants
 of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an
 end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.

CH2 20:24  And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they
 looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the
 earth, and none escaped.

CH2 20:25  And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil
 of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies,
 and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they
 could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was
 so much.

CH2 20:26  And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of
 Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same
 place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.

CH2 20:27  Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
 Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for
 the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.

CH2 20:28  And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets
 unto the house of the LORD.

CH2 20:29  And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when
 they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.

CH2 20:30  So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest
 round about.

CH2 20:31  And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old
 when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.
 And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

CH2 20:32  And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from
 it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.

CH2 20:33  Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people
 had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.

CH2 20:34  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,
 behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is
 mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

CH2 20:35  And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
 Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:

CH2 20:36  And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and
 they made the ships in Eziongaber.

CH2 20:37  Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
 Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD
 hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to
 go to Tarshish.

CH2 21:1  Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
 fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.

CH2 21:2  And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and
 Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons
 of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.

CH2 21:3  And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of
 precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to
 Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.

CH2 21:4  Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
 strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers
 also of the princes of Israel.

CH2 21:5  Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

CH2 21:6  And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the
 house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that
 which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.

CH2 21:7  Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the
 covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to
 him and to his sons for ever.

CH2 21:8  In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
 Judah, and made themselves a king.

CH2 21:9  Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with
 him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him
 in, and the captains of the chariots.

CH2 21:10  So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
 The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had
 forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.

CH2 21:11  Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused
 the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah
 thereto.

CH2 21:12  And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,
 Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked
 in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

CH2 21:13  But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made
 Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms
 of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house,
 which were better than thyself:

CH2 21:14  Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy
 children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:

CH2 21:15  And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until
 thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.

CH2 21:16  Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
 Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:

CH2 21:17  And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all
 the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his
 wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of
 his sons.

CH2 21:18  And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
 incurable disease.

CH2 21:19  And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two
 years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore
 diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his
 fathers.

CH2 21:20  Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
 reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit
 they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.

CH2 22:1  And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king
 in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had
 slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.

CH2 22:2  Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he
 reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the
 daughter of Omri.

CH2 22:3  He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was
 his counsellor to do wickedly.

CH2 22:4  Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of
 Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his
 destruction.

CH2 22:5  He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of
 Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and
 the Syrians smote Joram.

CH2 22:6  And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which
 were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And
 Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of
 Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.

CH2 22:7  And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for
 when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi,
 whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.

CH2 22:8  And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the
 house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren
 of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.

CH2 22:9  And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
 Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried
 him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD
 with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the
 kingdom.

CH2 22:10  But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead,
 she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.

CH2 22:11  But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of
 Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put
 him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king
 Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of
 Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.

CH2 22:12  And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah
 reigned over the land.

CH2 23:1  And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the
 captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of
 Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and
 Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.

CH2 23:2  And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the
 cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to
 Jerusalem.

CH2 23:3  And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house
 of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the
 LORD hath said of the sons of David.

CH2 23:4  This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on
 the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the
 doors;

CH2 23:5  And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at
 the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the
 house of the LORD.

CH2 23:6  But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and
 they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but
 all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.

CH2 23:7  And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with
 his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall
 be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth
 out.

CH2 23:8  So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
 Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to
 come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for
 Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.

CH2 23:9  Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds
 spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were
 in the house of God.

CH2 23:10  And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand,
 from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by
 the altar and the temple, by the king round about.

CH2 23:11  Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the
 crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his
 sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.

CH2 23:12  Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising
 the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:

CH2 23:13  And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the
 entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people
 of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with
 instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent
 her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.

CH2 23:14  Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that
 were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and
 whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said,
 Slay her not in the house of the LORD.

CH2 23:15  So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering
 of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.

CH2 23:16  And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
 people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's people.

CH2 23:17  Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
 down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the
 priest of Baal before the altars.

CH2 23:18  Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the
 hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house
 of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written
 in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by
 David.

CH2 23:19  And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that
 none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.

CH2 23:20  And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
 governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the
 king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the
 king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.

CH2 23:21  And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet,
 after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

CH2 24:1  Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
 forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.

CH2 24:2  And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the
 days of Jehoiada the priest.

CH2 24:3  And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.

CH2 24:4  And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the
 house of the LORD.

CH2 24:5  And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said
 to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to
 repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the
 matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.

CH2 24:6  And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why
 hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of
 Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant
 of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of
 witness?

CH2 24:7  For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house
 of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they
 bestow upon Baalim.

CH2 24:8  And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without
 at the gate of the house of the LORD.

CH2 24:9  And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in
 to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel
 in the wilderness.

CH2 24:10  And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and
 cast into the chest, until they had made an end.

CH2 24:11  Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto
 the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there
 was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and
 emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they
 did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.

CH2 24:12  And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
 service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair
 the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the
 house of the LORD.

CH2 24:13  So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they
 set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.

CH2 24:14  And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money
 before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the
 LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels
 of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD
 continually all the days of Jehoiada.

CH2 24:15  But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
 hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.

CH2 24:16  And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he
 had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.

CH2 24:17  Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made
 obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

CH2 24:18  And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served
 groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their
 trespass.

CH2 24:19  Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and
 they testified against them: but they would not give ear.

CH2 24:20  And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the
 priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why
 transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because
 ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.

CH2 24:21  And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the
 commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.

CH2 24:22  Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his
 father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD
 look upon it, and require it.

CH2 24:23  And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria
 came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all
 the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil
 of them unto the king of Damascus.

CH2 24:24  For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and
 the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had
 forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against
 Joash.

CH2 24:25  And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great
 diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons
 of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried
 him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the
 kings.

CH2 24:26  And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of
 Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.

CH2 24:27  Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon
 him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the
 story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

CH2 25:1  Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
 Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

CH2 25:2  And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not
 with a perfect heart.

CH2 25:3  Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he
 slew his servants that had killed the king his father.

CH2 25:4  But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law
 in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not
 die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but
 every man shall die for his own sin.

CH2 25:5  Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over
 thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their
 fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty
 years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able
 to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.

CH2 25:6  He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel
 for an hundred talents of silver.

CH2 25:7  But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army
 of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the
 children of Ephraim.

CH2 25:8  But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall make
 thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.

CH2 25:9  And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the
 hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God
 answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.

CH2 25:10  Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him
 out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled
 against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.

CH2 25:11  And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went
 to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.

CH2 25:12  And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry
 away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down
 from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.

CH2 25:13  But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they
 should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria
 even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.

CH2 25:14  Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter
 of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set
 them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned
 incense unto them.

CH2 25:15  Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he
 sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the
 gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine
 hand?

CH2 25:16  And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto
 him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be
 smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined
 to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my
 counsel.

CH2 25:17  Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son
 of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one
 another in the face.

CH2 25:18  And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The
 thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying,
 Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that
 was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.

CH2 25:19  Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart
 lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to
 thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?

CH2 25:20  But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might
 deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the
 gods of Edom.

CH2 25:21  So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the
 face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to
 Judah.

CH2 25:22  And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every
 man to his tent.

CH2 25:23  And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of
 Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and
 brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate,
 four hundred cubits.

CH2 25:24  And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that
 were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's
 house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.

CH2 25:25  And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of
 Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

CH2 25:26  Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are
 they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?

CH2 25:27  Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the
 LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish:
 but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.

CH2 25:28  And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers
 in the city of Judah.

CH2 26:1  Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years
 old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.

CH2 26:2  He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept
 with his fathers.

CH2 26:3  Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned
 fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of
 Jerusalem.

CH2 26:4  And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according
 to all that his father Amaziah did.

CH2 26:5  And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding
 in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to
 prosper.

CH2 26:6  And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down
 the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built
 cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.

CH2 26:7  And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians
 that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.

CH2 26:8  And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad
 even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.

CH2 26:9  Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at
 the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.

CH2 26:10  Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he
 had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen
 also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved
 husbandry.

CH2 26:11  Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by
 bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the
 scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's
 captains.

CH2 26:12  The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of
 valour were two thousand and six hundred.

CH2 26:13  And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven
 thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king
 against the enemy.

CH2 26:14  And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and
 spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.

CH2 26:15  And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on
 the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal.
 And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was
 strong.

CH2 26:16  But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction:
 for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the
 LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.

CH2 26:17  And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore
 priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:

CH2 26:18  And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It
 appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the
 priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out
 of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine
 honour from the LORD God.

CH2 26:19  Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense:
 and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his
 forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense
 altar.

CH2 26:20  And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
 him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out
 from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten
 him.

CH2 26:21  And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt
 in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the
 LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the
 land.

CH2 26:22  Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the
 prophet, the son of Amoz, write.

CH2 26:23  So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
 fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they
 said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

CH2 27:1  Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jerushah, the
 daughter of Zadok.

CH2 27:2  And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according
 to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple
 of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.

CH2 27:3  He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of
 Ophel he built much.

CH2 27:4  Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
 forests he built castles and towers.

CH2 27:5  He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against
 them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of
 silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So
 much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the
 third.

CH2 27:6  So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD
 his God.

CH2 27:7  Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways,
 lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

CH2 27:8  He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned
 sixteen years in Jerusalem.

CH2 27:9  And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of
 David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

CH2 28:1  Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
 sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight
 of the LORD, like David his father:

CH2 28:2  For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also
 molten images for Baalim.

CH2 28:3  Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and
 burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom
 the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.

CH2 28:4  He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the
 hills, and under every green tree.

CH2 28:5  Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of
 Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them
 captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the
 hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.

CH2 28:6  For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty
 thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken
 the LORD God of their fathers.

CH2 28:7  And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's
 son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the
 king.

CH2 28:8  And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two
 hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil
 from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.

CH2 28:9  But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went
 out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because
 the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them
 into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto
 heaven.

CH2 28:10  And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem
 for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with
 you, sins against the LORD your God?

CH2 28:11  Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have
 taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.

CH2 28:12  Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the
 son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of
 Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from
 the war,

CH2 28:13  And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for
 whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to
 our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce
 wrath against Israel.

CH2 28:14  So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes
 and all the congregation.

CH2 28:15  And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
 captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and
 arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed
 them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to
 Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to
 Samaria.

CH2 28:16  At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help
 him.

CH2 28:17  For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away
 captives.

CH2 28:18  The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and
 of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and
 Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages
 thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.

CH2 28:19  For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for
 he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.

CH2 28:20  And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed
 him, but strengthened him not.

CH2 28:21  For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out
 of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of
 Assyria: but he helped him not.

CH2 28:22  And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the
 LORD: this is that king Ahaz.

CH2 28:23  For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he
 said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I
 sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and
 of all Israel.

CH2 28:24  And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut
 in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house
 of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.

CH2 28:25  And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
 incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.

CH2 28:26  Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
 behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

CH2 28:27  And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city,
 even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings
 of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

CH2 29:1  Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he
 reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
 Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

CH2 29:2  And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according
 to all that David his father had done.

CH2 29:3  He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the
 doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.

CH2 29:4  And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them
 together into the east street,

CH2 29:5  And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and
 sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the
 filthiness out of the holy place.

CH2 29:6  For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the
 eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their
 faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.

CH2 29:7  Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps,
 and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place
 unto the God of Israel.

CH2 29:8  Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he
 hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see
 with your eyes.

CH2 29:9  For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our
 daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.

CH2 29:10  Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of
 Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.

CH2 29:11  My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand
 before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn
 incense.

CH2 29:12  Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son
 of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish
 the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites;
 Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:

CH2 29:13  And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of
 Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:

CH2 29:14  And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of
 Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.

CH2 29:15  And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and
 came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to
 cleanse the house of the LORD.

CH2 29:16  And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD,
 to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the
 temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites
 took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.

CH2 29:17  Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and
 on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they
 sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day
 of the first month they made an end.

CH2 29:18  Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed
 all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the
 vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.

CH2 29:19  Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away
 in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are
 before the altar of the LORD.

CH2 29:20  Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the
 city, and went up to the house of the LORD.

CH2 29:21  And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs,
 and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the
 sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to
 offer them on the altar of the LORD.

CH2 29:22  So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and
 sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they
 sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they
 sprinkled the blood upon the altar.

CH2 29:23  And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the
 king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:

CH2 29:24  And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their
 blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king
 commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all
 Israel.

CH2 29:25  And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with
 psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad
 the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the
 LORD by his prophets.

CH2 29:26  And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests
 with the trumpets.

CH2 29:27  And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar.
 And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the
 trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.

CH2 29:28  And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the
 trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was
 finished.

CH2 29:29  And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that
 were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.

CH2 29:30  Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to
 sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And
 they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.

CH2 29:31  Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves
 unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the
 house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank
 offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.

CH2 29:32  And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
 brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred
 lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.

CH2 29:33  And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand
 sheep.

CH2 29:34  But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the
 burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the
 work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for
 the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the
 priests.

CH2 29:35  And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the
 peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the
 service of the house of the LORD was set in order.

CH2 29:36  And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the
 people: for the thing was done suddenly.

CH2 30:1  And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to
 Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at
 Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.

CH2 30:2  For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
 congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.

CH2 30:3  For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not
 sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered
 themselves together to Jerusalem.

CH2 30:4  And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.

CH2 30:5  So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
 Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the
 passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it
 of a long time in such sort as it was written.

CH2 30:6  So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
 throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the
 king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham,
 Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped
 out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.

CH2 30:7  And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
 trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up
 to desolation, as ye see.

CH2 30:8  Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves
 unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for
 ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn
 away from you.

CH2 30:9  For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children
 shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall
 come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and
 merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.

CH2 30:10  So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim
 and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked
 them.

CH2 30:11  Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
 themselves, and came to Jerusalem.

CH2 30:12  Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the
 commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.

CH2 30:13  And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of
 unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.

CH2 30:14  And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and
 all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook
 Kidron.

CH2 30:15  Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second
 month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified
 themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.

CH2 30:16  And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the
 law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they
 received of the hand of the Levites.

CH2 30:17  For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified:
 therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for
 every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.

CH2 30:18  For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh,
 Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the
 passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying,
 The good LORD pardon every one

CH2 30:19  That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers,
 though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.

CH2 30:20  And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.

CH2 30:21  And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the
 feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and
 the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto
 the LORD.

CH2 30:22  And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the
 good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days,
 offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their
 fathers.

CH2 30:23  And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and
 they kept other seven days with gladness.

CH2 30:24  For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand
 bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a
 thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests
 sanctified themselves.

CH2 30:25  And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
 Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers
 that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

CH2 30:26  So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon
 the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.

CH2 30:27  Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their
 voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even
 unto heaven.

CH2 31:1  Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out
 to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the
 groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and
 Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them
 all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession,
 into their own cities.

CH2 31:2  And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites
 after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and
 Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give
 thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.

CH2 31:3  He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt
 offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt
 offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as
 it is written in the law of the LORD.

CH2 31:4  Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the
 portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the
 law of the LORD.

CH2 31:5  And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel
 brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and
 of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in
 abundantly.

CH2 31:6  And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the
 cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the
 tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid
 them by heaps.

CH2 31:7  In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and
 finished them in the seventh month.

CH2 31:8  And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
 blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.

CH2 31:9  Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning
 the heaps.

CH2 31:10  And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and
 said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the
 LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath
 blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.

CH2 31:11  Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the
 LORD; and they prepared them,

CH2 31:12  And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things
 faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother
 was the next.

CH2 31:13  And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and
 Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers
 under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of
 Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

CH2 31:14  And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east,
 was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the
 LORD, and the most holy things.

CH2 31:15  And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,
 Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to
 give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:

CH2 31:16  Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward,
 even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily
 portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;

CH2 31:17  Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers,
 and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their
 courses;

CH2 31:18  And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and
 their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their
 set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:

CH2 31:19  Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields
 of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were
 expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and
 to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.

CH2 31:20  And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which
 was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.

CH2 31:21  And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
 God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with
 all his heart, and prospered.

CH2 32:1  After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king
 of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced
 cities, and thought to win them for himself.

CH2 32:2  And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was
 purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

CH2 32:3  He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the
 waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.

CH2 32:4  So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the
 fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why
 should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?

CH2 32:5  Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was
 broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and
 repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.

CH2 32:6  And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
 together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably
 to them, saying,

CH2 32:7  Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of
 Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with
 us than with him:

CH2 32:8  With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help
 us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words
 of Hezekiah king of Judah.

CH2 32:9  After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to
 Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with
 him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem,
 saying,

CH2 32:10  Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye
 abide in the siege in Jerusalem?

CH2 32:11  Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
 famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the
 hand of the king of Assyria?

CH2 32:12  Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his
 altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before
 one altar, and burn incense upon it?

CH2 32:13  Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of
 other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to
 deliver their lands out of mine hand?

CH2 32:14  Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers
 utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your
 God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?

CH2 32:15  Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this
 manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able
 to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers:
 how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?

CH2 32:16  And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against
 his servant Hezekiah.

CH2 32:17  He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to
 speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not
 delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah
 deliver his people out of mine hand.

CH2 32:18  Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the
 people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble
 them; that they might take the city.

CH2 32:19  And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods
 of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.

CH2 32:20  And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son
 of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.

CH2 32:21  And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of
 valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So
 he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the
 house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with
 the sword.

CH2 32:22  Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from
 the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all
 other, and guided them on every side.

CH2 32:23  And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to
 Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations
 from thenceforth.

CH2 32:24  In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the
 LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.

CH2 32:25  But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto
 him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and
 upon Judah and Jerusalem.

CH2 32:26  Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart,
 both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came
 not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

CH2 32:27  And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
 himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for
 spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;

CH2 32:28  Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and
 stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

CH2 32:29  Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds
 in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.

CH2 32:30  This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and
 brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah
 prospered in all his works.

CH2 32:31  Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
 Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the
 land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.

CH2 32:32  Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they
 are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the
 book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

CH2 32:33  And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
 chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son
 reigned in his stead.

CH2 33:1  Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
 fifty and five years in Jerusalem:

CH2 33:2  But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the
 abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children
 of Israel.

CH2 33:3  For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
 broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and
 worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.

CH2 33:4  Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had
 said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.

CH2 33:5  And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
 of the house of the LORD.

CH2 33:6  And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley
 of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used
 witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought
 much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

CH2 33:7  And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house
 of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this
 house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel,
 will I put my name for ever:

CH2 33:8  Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the
 land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to
 do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the
 statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.

CH2 33:9  So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and
 to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children
 of Israel.

CH2 33:10  And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would
 not hearken.

CH2 33:11  Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the
 king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with
 fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

CH2 33:12  And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and
 humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

CH2 33:13  And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his
 supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then
 Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.

CH2 33:14  Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the
 west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish
 gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and
 put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.

CH2 33:15  And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house
 of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house
 of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.

CH2 33:16  And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace
 offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of
 Israel.

CH2 33:17  Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet
 unto the LORD their God only.

CH2 33:18  Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
 God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God
 of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.

CH2 33:19  His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins,
 and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up
 groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written
 among the sayings of the seers.

CH2 33:20  So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own
 house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

CH2 33:21  Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
 reigned two years in Jerusalem.

CH2 33:22  But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did
 Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which
 Manasseh his father had made, and served them;

CH2 33:23  And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had
 humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.

CH2 33:24  And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own
 house.

CH2 33:25  But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against
 king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

CH2 34:1  Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in
 Jerusalem one and thirty years.

CH2 34:2  And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked
 in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor
 to the left.

CH2 34:3  For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began
 to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began
 to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the
 carved images, and the molten images.

CH2 34:4  And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the
 images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the
 carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust
 of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto
 them.

CH2 34:5  And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed
 Judah and Jerusalem.

CH2 34:6  And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon,
 even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

CH2 34:7  And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten
 the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the
 land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.

CH2 34:8  Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the
 land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the
 governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the
 house of the LORD his God.

CH2 34:9  And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the
 money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the
 doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the
 remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to
 Jerusalem.

CH2 34:10  And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight
 of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the
 house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:

CH2 34:11  Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
 stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of
 Judah had destroyed.

CH2 34:12  And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were
 Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and
 Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the
 Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.

CH2 34:13  Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of
 all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there
 were scribes, and officers, and porters.

CH2 34:14  And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house
 of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by
 Moses.

CH2 34:15  And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found
 the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book
 to Shaphan.

CH2 34:16  And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word
 back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.

CH2 34:17  And they have gathered together the money that was found in the
 house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and
 to the hand of the workmen.

CH2 34:18  Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest
 hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.

CH2 34:19  And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law,
 that he rent his clothes.

CH2 34:20  And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and
 Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the
 king's, saying,

CH2 34:21  Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel
 and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is
 the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have
 not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.

CH2 34:22  And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah
 the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah,
 keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they
 spake to her to that effect.

CH2 34:23  And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye
 the man that sent you to me,

CH2 34:24  Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and
 upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the
 book which they have read before the king of Judah:

CH2 34:25  Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other
 gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands;
 therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be
 quenched.

CH2 34:26  And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD,
 so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the
 words which thou hast heard;

CH2 34:27  Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before
 God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the
 inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy
 clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.

CH2 34:28  Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
 gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil
 that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So
 they brought the king word again.

CH2 34:29  Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and
 Jerusalem.

CH2 34:30  And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of
 Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the
 Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all
 the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the
 LORD.

CH2 34:31  And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the
 LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his
 testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to
 perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.

CH2 34:32  And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to
 stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant
 of God, the God of their fathers.

CH2 34:33  And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries
 that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in
 Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they
 departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.

CH2 35:1  Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they
 killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.

CH2 35:2  And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the
 service of the house of the LORD,

CH2 35:3  And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy
 unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David
 king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve
 now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,

CH2 35:4  And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your
 courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according
 to the writing of Solomon his son.

CH2 35:5  And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
 families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division
 of the families of the Levites.

CH2 35:6  So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your
 brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of
 Moses.

CH2 35:7  And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for
 the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty
 thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.

CH2 35:8  And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and
 to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God,
 gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred
 small cattle and three hundred oxen.

CH2 35:9  Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
 Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites
 for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.

CH2 35:10  So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
 place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.

CH2 35:11  And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood
 from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.

CH2 35:12  And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according
 to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it
 is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.

CH2 35:13  And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance:
 but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans,
 and divided them speedily among all the people.

CH2 35:14  And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests:
 because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt
 offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for
 themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.

CH2 35:15  And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according
 to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's
 seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their
 service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.

CH2 35:16  So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep
 the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD,
 according to the commandment of king Josiah.

CH2 35:17  And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at
 that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.

CH2 35:18  And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days
 of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a
 passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and
 Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

CH2 35:19  In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover
 kept.

CH2 35:20  After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of
 Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out
 against him.

CH2 35:21  But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee,
 thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house
 wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from
 meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.

CH2 35:22  Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised
 himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of
 Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.

CH2 35:23  And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
 servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

CH2 35:24  His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him
 in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he
 died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah
 and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.

CH2 35:25  And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the
 singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made
 them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the
 lamentations.

CH2 35:26  Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to
 that which was written in the law of the LORD,

CH2 35:27  And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book
 of the kings of Israel and Judah.

CH2 36:1  Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made
 him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.

CH2 36:2  Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and
 he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

CH2 36:3  And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the
 land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.

CH2 36:4  And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and
 Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his
 brother, and carried him to Egypt.

CH2 36:5  Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
 he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the
 sight of the LORD his God.

CH2 36:6  Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in
 fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

CH2 36:7  Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD
 to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.

CH2 36:8  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he
 did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book
 of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his
 stead.

CH2 36:9  Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
 three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the
 sight of the LORD.

CH2 36:10  And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought
 him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made
 Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.

CH2 36:11  Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
 reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

CH2 36:12  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and
 humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth
 of the LORD.

CH2 36:13  And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him
 swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning
 unto the LORD God of Israel.

CH2 36:14  Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed
 very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house
 of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.

CH2 36:15  And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers,
 rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and
 on his dwelling place:

CH2 36:16  But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and
 misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people,
 till there was no remedy.

CH2 36:17  Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew
 their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no
 compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he
 gave them all into his hand.

CH2 36:18  And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the
 treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his
 princes; all these he brought to Babylon.

CH2 36:19  And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
 Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the
 goodly vessels thereof.

CH2 36:20  And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon;
 where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom
 of Persia:

CH2 36:21  To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the
 land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept
 sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.

CH2 36:22  Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the
 LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred
 up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout
 all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,

CH2 36:23  Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath
 the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house
 in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people?
 The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.

EZR 1:1  Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the
 LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the
 spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all
 his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,

EZR 1:2  Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me
 all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house
 at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

EZR 1:3  Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let
 him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD
 God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.

EZR 1:4  And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men
 of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with
 beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in
 Jerusalem.

EZR 1:5  Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the
 priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up
 to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.

EZR 1:6  And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with
 vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious
 things, beside all that was willingly offered.

EZR 1:7  Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the
 LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put
 them in the house of his gods;

EZR 1:8  Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of
 Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of
 Judah.

EZR 1:9  And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand
 chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,

EZR 1:10  Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred
 and ten, and other vessels a thousand.

EZR 1:11  All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four
 hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that
 were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.

EZR 2:1  Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the
 captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king
 of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and
 Judah, every one unto his city;

EZR 2:2  Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah,
 Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men

EZR 2:40  The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of
 Hodaviah, seventy and four.

EZR 2:41  The singers: the children of Asaph, an hundred twenty and eight.

EZR 2:42  The children of the porters: the children of Shallum, the children of
 Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of
 Hatita, the children of Shobai, in all an hundred thirty and nine.

EZR 2:43  The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the
 children of Tabbaoth,

EZR 2:44  The children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of Padon,

EZR 2:45  The children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children of
 Akkub,

EZR 2:46  The children of Hagab, the children of Shalmai, the children of
 Hanan,

EZR 2:47  The children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of
 Reaiah,

EZR 2:48  The children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of
 Gazzam,

EZR 2:49  The children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai,

EZR 2:50  The children of Asnah, the children of Mehunim, the children of
 Nephusim,

EZR 2:51  The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of
 Harhur,

EZR 2:52  The children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children of
 Harsha,

EZR 2:53  The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of
 Thamah,

EZR 2:54  The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

EZR 2:55  The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the
 children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda,

EZR 2:56  The children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children of
 Giddel,

EZR 2:57  The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of
 Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami.

EZR 2:58  All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three
 hundred ninety and two.

EZR 2:59  And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa, Cherub,
 Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, and their
 seed, whether they were of Israel:

EZR 2:60  The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of
 Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.

EZR 2:61  And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the
 children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a wife of the
 daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name:

EZR 2:62  These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
 genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put
 from the priesthood.

EZR 2:63  And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the
 most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.

EZR 2:64  The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
 hundred and threescore,

EZR 2:65  Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven
 thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two
 hundred singing men and singing women.

EZR 2:66  Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two
 hundred forty and five;

EZR 2:67  Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand
 seven hundred and twenty.

EZR 2:68  And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house
 of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set
 it up in his place:

EZR 2:69  They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work
 threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of
 silver, and one hundred priests' garments.

EZR 2:70  So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the
 singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all
 Israel in their cities.

EZR 3:1  And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were
 in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to
 Jerusalem.

EZR 3:2  Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests,
 and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar
 of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written
 in the law of Moses the man of God.

EZR 3:3  And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because
 of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon
 unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.

EZR 3:4  They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered
 the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of
 every day required;

EZR 3:5  And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new
 moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of
 every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.

EZR 3:6  From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt
 offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not
 yet laid.

EZR 3:7  They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and
 meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring
 cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that
 they had of Cyrus king of Persia.

EZR 3:8  Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at
 Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and
 Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and
 the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem;
 and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward
 the work of the house of the LORD.

EZR 3:9  Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his
 sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of
 God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.

EZR 3:10  And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the
 LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites
 the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of
 David king of Israel.

EZR 3:11  And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto
 the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel.
 And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD,
 because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.

EZR 3:12  But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who
 were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this
 house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted
 aloud for joy:

EZR 3:13  So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy
 from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a
 loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.

EZR 4:1  Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children
 of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;

EZR 4:2  Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and
 said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we
 do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which
 brought us up hither.

EZR 4:3  But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers
 of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house
 unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of
 Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.

EZR 4:4  Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of
 Judah, and troubled them in building,

EZR 4:5  And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all
 the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of
 Persia.

EZR 4:6  And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote
 they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.

EZR 4:7  And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and
 the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing
 of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian
 tongue.

EZR 4:8  Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against
 Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:

EZR 4:9  Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest
 of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the
 Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the
 Dehavites, and the Elamites,

EZR 4:10  And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought
 over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side
 the river, and at such a time.

EZR 4:11  This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto
 Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such
 a time.

EZR 4:12  Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to
 us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and
 have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.

EZR 4:13  Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the
 walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so
 thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.

EZR 4:14  Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was
 not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and
 certified the king;

EZR 4:15  That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so
 shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a
 rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have
 moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city
 destroyed.

EZR 4:16  We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the
 walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side
 the river.

EZR 4:17  Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to
 Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in
 Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.

EZR 4:18  The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.

EZR 4:19  And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this
 city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and
 sedition have been made therein.

EZR 4:20  There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled
 over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid
 unto them.

EZR 4:21  Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this
 city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.

EZR 4:22  Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow
 to the hurt of the kings?

EZR 4:23  Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before
 Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste
 to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.

EZR 4:24  Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it
 ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

EZR 5:1  Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo,
 prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the
 God of Israel, even unto them.

EZR 5:2  Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of
 Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with
 them were the prophets of God helping them.

EZR 5:3  At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the
 river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who
 hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?

EZR 5:4  Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the
 men that make this building?

EZR 5:5  But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they
 could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they
 returned answer by letter concerning this matter.

EZR 5:6  The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
 river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on
 this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:

EZR 5:7  They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the
 king, all peace.

EZR 5:8  Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea,
 to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber
 is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their
 hands.

EZR 5:9  Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you
 to build this house, and to make up these walls?

EZR 5:10  We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the
 names of the men that were the chief of them.

EZR 5:11  And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the
 God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many
 years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.

EZR 5:12  But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath,
 he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the
 Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.

EZR 5:13  But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king
 Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.

EZR 5:14  And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which
 Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them
 into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple
 of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar,
 whom he had made governor;

EZR 5:15  And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple
 that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.

EZR 5:16  Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house
 of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been
 in building, and yet it is not finished.

EZR 5:17  Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made
 in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so,
 that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at
 Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

EZR 6:1  Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house
 of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.

EZR 6:2  And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province
 of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:

EZR 6:3  In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a
 decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be
 builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations
 thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the
 breadth thereof threescore cubits;

EZR 6:4  With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the
 expenses be given out of the king's house:

EZR 6:5  And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which
 Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and
 brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is
 at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.

EZR 6:6  Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and
 your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from
 thence:

EZR 6:7  Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews
 and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.

EZR 6:8  Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews
 for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the
 tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that
 they be not hindered.

EZR 6:9  And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and
 lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and
 oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let
 it be given them day by day without fail:

EZR 6:10  That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of
 heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.

EZR 6:11  Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let
 timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged
 thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.

EZR 6:12  And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all
 kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this
 house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be
 done with speed.

EZR 6:13  Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and
 their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they
 did speedily.

EZR 6:14  And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the
 prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they
 builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of
 Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes
 king of Persia.

EZR 6:15  And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which
 was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.

EZR 6:16  And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the
 rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of
 God with joy.

EZR 6:17  And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
 bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for
 all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.

EZR 6:18  And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their
 courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written
 in the book of Moses.

EZR 6:19  And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
 fourteenth day of the first month.

EZR 6:20  For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them
 were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and
 for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.

EZR 6:21  And the children of Israel, which were come again out of
 captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the
 filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did
 eat,

EZR 6:22  And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the
 LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto
 them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of
 Israel.

EZR 7:1  Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia,
 Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,

EZR 7:2  The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,

EZR 7:3  The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,

EZR 7:4  The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,

EZR 7:5  The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son
 of Aaron the chief priest:

EZR 7:6  This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law
 of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him
 all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.

EZR 7:7  And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests,
 and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto
 Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.

EZR 7:8  And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh
 year of the king.

EZR 7:9  For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from
 Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem,
 according to the good hand of his God upon him.

EZR 7:10  For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to
 do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

EZR 7:11  Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto
 Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments
 of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.

EZR 7:12  Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law
 of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.

EZR 7:13  I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his
 priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to
 go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.

EZR 7:14  Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors,
 to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God
 which is in thine hand;

EZR 7:15  And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors
 have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,

EZR 7:16  And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province
 of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests,
 offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem:

EZR 7:17  That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs,
 with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the
 altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.

EZR 7:18  And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do
 with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.

EZR 7:19  The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of
 thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.

EZR 7:20  And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which
 thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure
 house.

EZR 7:21  And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
 treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the
 scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done
 speedily,

EZR 7:22  Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of
 wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and
 salt without prescribing how much.

EZR 7:23  Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently
 done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath
 against the realm of the king and his sons?

EZR 7:24  Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites,
 singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not
 be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.

EZR 7:25  And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand,
 set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond
 the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know
 them not.

EZR 7:26  And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the
 king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death,
 or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.

EZR 7:27  Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing
 as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in
 Jerusalem:

EZR 7:28  And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors,
 and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand
 of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief
 men to go up with me.

EZR 8:1  These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy
 of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the
 king.

EZR 8:2  Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel:
 of the sons of David; Hattush.

EZR 8:3  Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with
 him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.

EZR 8:4  Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him
 two hundred males.

EZR 8:5  Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three
 hundred males.

EZR 8:6  Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty
 males.

EZR 8:7  And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him
 seventy males.

EZR 8:8  And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with
 him fourscore males.

EZR 8:9  Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two
 hundred and eighteen males.

EZR 8:10  And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an
 hundred and threescore males.

EZR 8:11  And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him
 twenty and eight males.

EZR 8:12  And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him
 an hundred and ten males.

EZR 8:13  And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet,
 Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.

EZR 8:14  Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy
 males.

EZR 8:15  And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and
 there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests,
 and found there none of the sons of Levi.

EZR 8:16  Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
 Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for
 Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan,
 men of understanding.

EZR 8:17  And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place
 Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren
 the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us
 ministers for the house of our God.

EZR 8:18  And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of
 understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and
 Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;

EZR 8:19  And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his
 brethren and their sons, twenty;

EZR 8:20  Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for
 the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them
 were expressed by name.

EZR 8:21  Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might
 afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for
 our little ones, and for all our substance.

EZR 8:22  For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and
 horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto
 the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek
 him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.

EZR 8:23  So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of
 us.

EZR 8:24  Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah,
 Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,

EZR 8:25  And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even
 the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors,
 and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:

EZR 8:26  I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of
 silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred
 talents;

EZR 8:27  Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of
 fine copper, precious as gold.

EZR 8:28  And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy
 also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God
 of your fathers.

EZR 8:29  Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the
 priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem,
 in the chambers of the house of the LORD.

EZR 8:30  So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the
 gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.

EZR 8:31  Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the
 first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and
 he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the
 way.

EZR 8:32  And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.

EZR 8:33  Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
 weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the
 priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was
 Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;

EZR 8:34  By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written
 at that time.

EZR 8:35  Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were
 come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel,
 twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs,
 twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the
 LORD.

EZR 8:36  And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's
 lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered
 the people, and the house of God.

EZR 9:1  Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The
 people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated
 themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their
 abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the
 Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.

EZR 9:2  For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their
 sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those
 lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this
 trespass.

EZR 9:3  And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and
 plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.

EZR 9:4  Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words
 of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been
 carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.

EZR 9:5  And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having
 rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands
 unto the LORD my God,

EZR 9:6  And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee,
 my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is
 grown up unto the heavens.

EZR 9:7  Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto
 this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been
 delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to
 captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.

EZR 9:8  And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our
 God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy
 place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in
 our bondage.

EZR 9:9  For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage,
 but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give
 us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations
 thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

EZR 9:10  And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
 forsaken thy commandments,

EZR 9:11  Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The
 land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness
 of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it
 from one end to another with their uncleanness.

EZR 9:12  Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take
 their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for
 ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for
 an inheritance to your children for ever.

EZR 9:13  And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our
 great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our
 iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;

EZR 9:14  Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the
 people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou
 hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?

EZR 9:15  O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped,
 as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we
 cannot stand before thee because of this.

EZR 10:1  Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and
 casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of
 Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the
 people wept very sore.

EZR 10:2  And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered
 and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken
 strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel
 concerning this thing.

EZR 10:3  Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the
 wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and
 of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done
 according to the law.

EZR 10:4  Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with
 thee: be of good courage, and do it.

EZR 10:5  Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all
 Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.

EZR 10:6  Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the
 chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat
 no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression
 of them that had been carried away.

EZR 10:7  And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all
 the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together
 unto Jerusalem;

EZR 10:8  And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the
 counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be
 forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been
 carried away.

EZR 10:9  Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together
 unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth
 day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God,
 trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.

EZR 10:10  And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
 transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of
 Israel.

EZR 10:11  Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and
 do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and
 from the strange wives.

EZR 10:12  Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As
 thou hast said, so must we do.

EZR 10:13  But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are
 not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we
 are many that have transgressed in this thing.

EZR 10:14  Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them
 which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and
 with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce
 wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.

EZR 10:15  Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were
 employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped
 them.

EZR 10:16  And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with
 certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all
 of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the
 tenth month to examine the matter.

EZR 10:17  And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives
 by the first day of the first month.

EZR 10:18  And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken
 strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his
 brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.

EZR 10:19  And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and
 being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.

EZR 10:20  And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.

EZR 10:21  And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and
 Jehiel, and Uzziah.

EZR 10:22  And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel,
 Jozabad, and Elasah.

EZR 10:23  Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is
 Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.

EZR 10:24  Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and
 Telem, and Uri.

EZR 10:25  Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and
 Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.

EZR 10:26  And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and
 Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.

EZR 10:27  And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and
 Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.

EZR 10:28  Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.

EZR 10:29  And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and
 Sheal, and Ramoth.

EZR 10:30  And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah,
 Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.

EZR 10:31  And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah,
 Shimeon,

EZR 10:32  Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.

EZR 10:33  Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet,
 Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.

EZR 10:34  Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,

EZR 10:35  Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,

EZR 10:36  Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

EZR 10:37  Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,

EZR 10:38  And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,

EZR 10:39  And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,

EZR 10:40  Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,

EZR 10:41  Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,

EZR 10:42  Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.

EZR 10:43  Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and
 Joel, Benaiah.

EZR 10:44  All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by
 whom they had children.

KI1 1:1  Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him
 with clothes, but he gat no heat.

KI1 1:2  Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord
 the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her
 cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get
 heat.

KI1 1:3  So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
 Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

KI1 1:4  And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered
 to him: but the king knew her not.

KI1 1:5  Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be
 king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before
 him.

KI1 1:6  And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast
 thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him
 after Absalom.

KI1 1:7  And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the
 priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.

KI1 1:8  But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the
 prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David,
 were not with Adonijah.

KI1 1:9  And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
 Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons,
 and all the men of Judah the king's servants:

KI1 1:10  But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon
 his brother, he called not.

KI1 1:11  Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying,
 Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David
 our lord knoweth it not?

KI1 1:12  Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou
 mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.

KI1 1:13  Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou,
 my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son
 shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah
 reign?

KI1 1:14  Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come
 in after thee, and confirm thy words.

KI1 1:15  And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king
 was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.

KI1 1:16  And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king
 said, What wouldest thou?

KI1 1:17  And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto
 thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and
 he shall sit upon my throne.

KI1 1:18  And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou
 knowest it not:

KI1 1:19  And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and
 hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the
 captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.

KI1 1:20  And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that
 thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king
 after him.

KI1 1:21  Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep
 with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.

KI1 1:22  And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also
 came in.

KI1 1:23  And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when
 he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his
 face to the ground.

KI1 1:24  And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall
 reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

KI1 1:25  For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and
 sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains
 of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before
 him, and say, God save king Adonijah.

KI1 1:26  But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the
 son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.

KI1 1:27  Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it
 unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?

KI1 1:28  Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came
 into the king's presence, and stood before the king.

KI1 1:29  And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed
 my soul out of all distress,

KI1 1:30  Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying,
 Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my
 throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.

KI1 1:31  Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence
 to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.

KI1 1:32  And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
 prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.

KI1 1:33  The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your
 lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down
 to Gihon:

KI1 1:34  And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king
 over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.

KI1 1:35  Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my
 throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be
 ruler over Israel and over Judah.

KI1 1:36  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen:
 the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.

KI1 1:37  As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with
 Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.

KI1 1:38  So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of
 Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused
 Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.

KI1 1:39  And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and
 anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God
 save king Solomon.

KI1 1:40  And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with
 pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound
 of them.

KI1 1:41  And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they
 had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he
 said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?

KI1 1:42  And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the
 priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant
 man, and bringest good tidings.

KI1 1:43  And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king
 David hath made Solomon king.

KI1 1:44  And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
 prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the
 Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:

KI1 1:45  And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in
 Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang
 again. This is the noise that ye have heard.

KI1 1:46  And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

KI1 1:47  And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David,
 saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his
 throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.

KI1 1:48  And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which
 hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.

KI1 1:49  And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose
 up, and went every man his way.

KI1 1:50  And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and
 caught hold on the horns of the altar.

KI1 1:51  And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
 Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let
 king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the
 sword.

KI1 1:52  And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall
 not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in
 him, he shall die.

KI1 1:53  So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And
 he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to
 thine house.

KI1 2:1  Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
 Solomon his son, saying,

KI1 2:2  I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew
 thyself a man;

KI1 2:3  And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep
 his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies,
 as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that
 thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:

KI1 2:4  That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me,
 saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth
 with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said
 he) a man on the throne of Israel.

KI1 2:5  Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and
 what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of
 Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of
 war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his
 loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.

KI1 2:6  Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go
 down to the grave in peace.

KI1 2:7  But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let
 them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled
 because of Absalom thy brother.

KI1 2:8  And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite
 of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to
 Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the
 LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.

KI1 2:9  Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and
 knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down
 to the grave with blood.

KI1 2:10  So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.

KI1 2:11  And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven
 years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in
 Jerusalem.

KI1 2:12  Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom
 was established greatly.

KI1 2:13  And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of
 Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.

KI1 2:14  He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say
 on.

KI1 2:15  And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all
 Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is
 turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.

KI1 2:16  And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto
 him, Say on.

KI1 2:17  And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will
 not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.

KI1 2:18  And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.

KI1 2:19  Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for
 Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and
 sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother;
 and she sat on his right hand.

KI1 2:20  Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say
 me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say
 thee nay.

KI1 2:21  And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy
 brother to wife.

KI1 2:22  And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou
 ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he
 is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for
 Joab the son of Zeruiah.

KI1 2:23  Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and
 more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.

KI1 2:24  Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set
 me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he
 promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.

KI1 2:25  And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and
 he fell upon him that he died.

KI1 2:26  And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,
 unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this
 time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD God before
 David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my
 father was afflicted.

KI1 2:27  So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that
 he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of
 Eli in Shiloh.

KI1 2:28  Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though
 he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the
 LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

KI1 2:29  And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle
 of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the
 son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.

KI1 2:30  And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him,
 Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And
 Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he
 answered me.

KI1 2:31  And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
 him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab
 shed, from me, and from the house of my father.

KI1 2:32  And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon
 two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my
 father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain
 of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of
 Judah.

KI1 2:33  Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon
 the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon
 his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.

KI1 2:34  So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew
 him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.

KI1 2:35  And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the
 host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.

KI1 2:36  And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build
 thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any
 whither.

KI1 2:37  For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the
 brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy
 blood shall be upon thine own head.

KI1 2:38  And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the
 king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many
 days.

KI1 2:39  And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
 servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they
 told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.

KI1 2:40  And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to
 seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.

KI1 2:41  And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
 Gath, and was come again.

KI1 2:42  And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not
 make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a
 certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou
 shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is
 good.

KI1 2:43  Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment
 that I have charged thee with?

KI1 2:44  The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness
 which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore
 the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;

KI1 2:45  And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be
 established before the LORD for ever.

KI1 2:46  So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
 out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the
 hand of Solomon.

KI1 3:1  And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
 Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made
 an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of
 Jerusalem round about.

KI1 3:2  Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house
 built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.

KI1 3:3  And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his
 father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.

KI1 3:4  And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great
 high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.

KI1 3:5  In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God
 said, Ask what I shall give thee.

KI1 3:6  And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father
 great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in
 righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for
 him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne,
 as it is this day.

KI1 3:7  And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of
 David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or
 come in.

KI1 3:8  And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen,
 a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.

KI1 3:9  Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people,
 that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so
 great a people?

KI1 3:10  And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.

KI1 3:11  And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast
 not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor
 hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself
 understanding to discern judgment;

KI1 3:12  Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a
 wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before
 thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.

KI1 3:13  And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both
 riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto
 thee all thy days.

KI1 3:14  And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
 commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.

KI1 3:15  And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
 Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered
 up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his
 servants.

KI1 3:16  Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and
 stood before him.

KI1 3:17  And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one
 house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.

KI1 3:18  And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that
 this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger
 with us in the house, save we two in the house.

KI1 3:19  And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.

KI1 3:20  And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while
 thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my
 bosom.

KI1 3:21  And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was
 dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son,
 which I did bear.

KI1 3:22  And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead
 is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my
 son. Thus they spake before the king.

KI1 3:23  Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and
 thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and
 my son is the living.

KI1 3:24  And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before
 the king.

KI1 3:25  And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half
 to the one, and half to the other.

KI1 3:26  Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for
 her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living
 child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor
 thine, but divide it.

KI1 3:27  Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no
 wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.

KI1 3:28  And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and
 they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do
 judgment.

KI1 4:1  So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

KI1 4:2  And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the
 priest,

KI1 4:3  Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son
 of Ahilud, the recorder.

KI1 4:4  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and
 Abiathar were the priests:

KI1 4:5  And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son
 of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:

KI1 4:6  And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was
 over the tribute.

KI1 4:7  And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided
 victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made
 provision.

KI1 4:8  And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:

KI1 4:9  The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and
 Elonbethhanan:

KI1 4:10  The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the
 land of Hepher:

KI1 4:11  The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the
 daughter of Solomon to wife:

KI1 4:12  Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and
 all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to
 Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:

KI1 4:13  The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair
 the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of
 Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen
 bars:

KI1 4:14  Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:

KI1 4:15  Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon
 to wife:

KI1 4:16  Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:

KI1 4:17  Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:

KI1 4:18  Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:

KI1 4:19  Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of
 Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only
 officer which was in the land.

KI1 4:20  Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
 multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.

KI1 4:21  And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land
 of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and
 served Solomon all the days of his life.

KI1 4:22  And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
 flour, and threescore measures of meal,

KI1 4:23  Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred
 sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.

KI1 4:24  For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from
 Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had
 peace on all sides round about him.

KI1 4:25  And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under
 his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.

KI1 4:26  And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and
 twelve thousand horsemen.

KI1 4:27  And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all
 that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked
 nothing.

KI1 4:28  Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they
 unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.

KI1 4:29  And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
 largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.

KI1 4:30  And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the
 east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

KI1 4:31  For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
 Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all
 nations round about.

KI1 4:32  And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand
 and five.

KI1 4:33  And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even
 unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and
 of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.

KI1 4:34  And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all
 kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

KI1 5:1  And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had
 heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram
 was ever a lover of David.

KI1 5:2  And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,

KI1 5:3  Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto
 the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side,
 until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.

KI1 5:4  But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that
 there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.

KI1 5:5  And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my
 God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set
 upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.

KI1 5:6  Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
 Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I
 give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou
 knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto
 the Sidonians.

KI1 5:7  And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he
 rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given
 unto David a wise son over this great people.

KI1 5:8  And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which
 thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of
 cedar, and concerning timber of fir.

KI1 5:9  My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I
 will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint
 me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them:
 and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.

KI1 5:10  So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his
 desire.

KI1 5:11  And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to
 his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram
 year by year.

KI1 5:12  And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was
 peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.

KI1 5:13  And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was
 thirty thousand men.

KI1 5:14  And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month
 they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.

KI1 5:15  And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and
 fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;

KI1 5:16  Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work,
 three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought
 in the work.

KI1 5:17  And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
 stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

KI1 5:18  And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the
 stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.

KI1 6:1  And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the
 children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of
 Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month,
 that he began to build the house of the LORD.

KI1 6:2  And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length
 thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the
 height thereof thirty cubits.

KI1 6:3  And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the
 length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the
 breadth thereof before the house.

KI1 6:4  And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.

KI1 6:5  And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
 against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the
 oracle: and he made chambers round about:

KI1 6:6  The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six
 cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall
 of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be
 fastened in the walls of the house.

KI1 6:7  And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready
 before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor
 any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.

KI1 6:8  The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house:
 and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the
 middle into the third.

KI1 6:9  So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with
 beams and boards of cedar.

KI1 6:10  And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high:
 and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

KI1 6:11  And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,

KI1 6:12  Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk
 in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to
 walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David
 thy father:

KI1 6:13  And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake
 my people Israel.

KI1 6:14  So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

KI1 6:15  And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both
 the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on
 the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.

KI1 6:16  And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor
 and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even
 for the oracle, even for the most holy place.

KI1 6:17  And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.

KI1 6:18  And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
 flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.

KI1 6:19  And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark
 of the covenant of the LORD.

KI1 6:20  And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and
 twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he
 overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.

KI1 6:21  So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a
 partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with
 gold.

KI1 6:22  And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all
 the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.

KI1 6:23  And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten
 cubits high.

KI1 6:24  And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the
 other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the
 uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.

KI1 6:25  And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one
 measure and one size.

KI1 6:26  The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the
 other cherub.

KI1 6:27  And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched
 forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one
 wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their
 wings touched one another in the midst of the house.

KI1 6:28  And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

KI1 6:29  And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
 figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.

KI1 6:30  And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
 without.

KI1 6:31  And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the
 lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.

KI1 6:32  The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
 carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with
 gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.

KI1 6:33  So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a
 fourth part of the wall.

KI1 6:34  And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door
 were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.

KI1 6:35  And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and
 covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.

KI1 6:36  And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a
 row of cedar beams.

KI1 6:37  In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid,
 in the month Zif:

KI1 6:38  And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth
 month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according
 to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.

KI1 7:1  But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished
 all his house.

KI1 7:2  He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof
 was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height
 thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon
 the pillars.

KI1 7:3  And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty
 five pillars, fifteen in a row.

KI1 7:4  And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in
 three ranks.

KI1 7:5  And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light
 was against light in three ranks.

KI1 7:6  And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits,
 and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the
 other pillars and the thick beam were before them.

KI1 7:7  Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the
 porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor
 to the other.

KI1 7:8  And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which
 was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom
 he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.

KI1 7:9  All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed
 stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto
 the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.

KI1 7:10  And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of
 ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

KI1 7:11  And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and
 cedars.

KI1 7:12  And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
 stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house
 of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.

KI1 7:13  And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

KI1 7:14  He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a
 man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and
 understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king
 Solomon, and wrought all his work.

KI1 7:15  For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and
 a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.

KI1 7:16  And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops
 of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the
 height of the other chapiter was five cubits:

KI1 7:17  And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the
 chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one
 chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.

KI1 7:18  And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
 network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates:
 and so did he for the other chapiter.

KI1 7:19  And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily
 work in the porch, four cubits.

KI1 7:20  And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above,
 over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were
 two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.

KI1 7:21  And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up
 the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left
 pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.

KI1 7:22  And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the
 pillars finished.

KI1 7:23  And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other:
 it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty
 cubits did compass it round about.

KI1 7:24  And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it,
 ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two
 rows, when it was cast.

KI1 7:25  It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three
 looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three
 looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their
 hinder parts were inward.

KI1 7:26  And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought
 like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand
 baths.

KI1 7:27  And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one
 base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.

KI1 7:28  And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and
 the borders were between the ledges:

KI1 7:29  And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and
 cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions
 and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.

KI1 7:30  And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the
 four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters
 molten, at the side of every addition.

KI1 7:31  And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but
 the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half:
 and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare,
 not round.

KI1 7:32  And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the
 wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and
 half a cubit.

KI1 7:33  And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:
 their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were
 all molten.

KI1 7:34  And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and
 the undersetters were of the very base itself.

KI1 7:35  And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit
 high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof
 were of the same.

KI1 7:36  For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof,
 he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of
 every one, and additions round about.

KI1 7:37  After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting,
 one measure, and one size.

KI1 7:38  Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths:
 and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one
 laver.

KI1 7:39  And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the
 left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house
 eastward over against the south.

KI1 7:40  And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram
 made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house
 of the LORD:

KI1 7:41  The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the
 top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the
 chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;

KI1 7:42  And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of
 pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that
 were upon the pillars;

KI1 7:43  And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;

KI1 7:44  And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;

KI1 7:45  And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels,
 which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright
 brass.

KI1 7:46  In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
 between Succoth and Zarthan.

KI1 7:47  And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
 exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.

KI1 7:48  And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the
 LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,

KI1 7:49  And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five
 on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the
 tongs of gold,

KI1 7:50  And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and
 the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the
 inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit,
 of the temple.

KI1 7:51  So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the
 LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated;
 even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the
 treasures of the house of the LORD.

KI1 8:1  Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
 tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon
 in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
 out of the city of David, which is Zion.

KI1 8:2  And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at
 the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.

KI1 8:3  And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.

KI1 8:4  And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the
 congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even
 those did the priests and the Levites bring up.

KI1 8:5  And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were
 assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen,
 that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

KI1 8:6  And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto
 his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under
 the wings of the cherubims.

KI1 8:7  For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the
 ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.

KI1 8:8  And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen
 out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and
 there they are unto this day.

KI1 8:9  There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses
 put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of
 Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

KI1 8:10  And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
 place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,

KI1 8:11  So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud:
 for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.

KI1 8:12  Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick
 darkness.

KI1 8:13  I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for
 thee to abide in for ever.

KI1 8:14  And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation
 of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)

KI1 8:15  And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his
 mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,

KI1 8:16  Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I
 chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name
 might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.

KI1 8:17  And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the
 name of the LORD God of Israel.

KI1 8:18  And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart
 to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.

KI1 8:19  Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall
 come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.

KI1 8:20  And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up
 in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD
 promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

KI1 8:21  And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant
 of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the
 land of Egypt.

KI1 8:22  And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all
 the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:

KI1 8:23  And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven
 above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants
 that walk before thee with all their heart:

KI1 8:24  Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst
 him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand,
 as it is this day.

KI1 8:25  Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my
 father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in
 my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed
 to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.

KI1 8:26  And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
 which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.

KI1 8:27  But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven
 of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?

KI1 8:28  Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his
 supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which
 thy servant prayeth before thee to day:

KI1 8:29  That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even
 toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou
 mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this
 place.

KI1 8:30  And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy
 people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in
 heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.

KI1 8:31  If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
 him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this
 house:

KI1 8:32  Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning
 the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to
 give him according to his righteousness.

KI1 8:33  When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they
 have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy
 name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:

KI1 8:34  Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people
 Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their
 fathers.

KI1 8:35  When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
 sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy
 name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:

KI1 8:36  Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of
 thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should
 walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an
 inheritance.

KI1 8:37  If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,
 mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them
 in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;

KI1 8:38  What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy
 people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and
 spread forth his hands toward this house:

KI1 8:39  Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and
 give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou,
 even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)

KI1 8:40  That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which
 thou gavest unto our fathers.

KI1 8:41  Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but
 cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;

KI1 8:42  (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and
 of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;

KI1 8:43  Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that
 the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy
 name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this
 house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.

KI1 8:44  If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever
 thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou
 hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:

KI1 8:45  Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and
 maintain their cause.

KI1 8:46  If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and
 thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry
 them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;

KI1 8:47  Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were
 carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land
 of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done
 perversely, we have committed wickedness;

KI1 8:48  And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their
 soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray
 unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city
 which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:

KI1 8:49  Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy
 dwelling place, and maintain their cause,

KI1 8:50  And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their
 transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them
 compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have
 compassion on them:

KI1 8:51  For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest
 forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:

KI1 8:52  That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and
 unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that
 they call for unto thee.

KI1 8:53  For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth,
 to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant,
 when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.

KI1 8:54  And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this
 prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the
 LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.

KI1 8:55  And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud
 voice, saying,

KI1 8:56  Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel,
 according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his
 good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.

KI1 8:57  The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not
 leave us, nor forsake us:

KI1 8:58  That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and
 to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he
 commanded our fathers.

KI1 8:59  And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the
 LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause
 of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the
 matter shall require:

KI1 8:60  That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and
 that there is none else.

KI1 8:61  Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in
 his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.

KI1 8:62  And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the
 LORD.

KI1 8:63  And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered
 unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty
 thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the
 house of the LORD.

KI1 8:64  The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was
 before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat
 offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that
 was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat
 offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.

KI1 8:65  And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a
 great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt,
 before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.

KI1 8:66  On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the
 king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness
 that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.

KI1 9:1  And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the
 house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he
 was pleased to do,

KI1 9:2  That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared
 unto him at Gibeon.

KI1 9:3  And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
 supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house,
 which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine
 heart shall be there perpetually.

KI1 9:4  And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in
 integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have
 commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:

KI1 9:5  Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,
 as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man
 upon the throne of Israel.

KI1 9:6  But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
 children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set
 before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:

KI1 9:7  Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them;
 and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my
 sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:

KI1 9:8  And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall
 be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done
 thus unto this land, and to this house?

KI1 9:9  And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who
 brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold
 upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath
 the LORD brought upon them all this evil.

KI1 9:10  And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had
 built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,

KI1 9:11  (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees
 and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king
 Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

KI1 9:12  And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
 given him; and they pleased him not.

KI1 9:13  And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my
 brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.

KI1 9:14  And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

KI1 9:15  And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to
 build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of
 Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.

KI1 9:16  For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it
 with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for
 a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.

KI1 9:17  And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,

KI1 9:18  And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,

KI1 9:19  And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his
 chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to
 build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.

KI1 9:20  And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
 Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,

KI1 9:21  Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the
 children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did
 Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.

KI1 9:22  But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they
 were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and
 rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.

KI1 9:23  These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work,
 five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the
 work.

KI1 9:24  But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her
 house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.

KI1 9:25  And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace
 offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense
 upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.

KI1 9:26  And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside
 Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.

KI1 9:27  And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge
 of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

KI1 9:28  And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred
 and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

KI1 10:1  And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning
 the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.

KI1 10:2  And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that
 bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come
 to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.

KI1 10:3  And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid
 from the king, which he told her not.

KI1 10:4  And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the
 house that he had built,

KI1 10:5  And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the
 attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his
 ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more
 spirit in her.

KI1 10:6  And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine
 own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.

KI1 10:7  Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had
 seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity
 exceedeth the fame which I heard.

KI1 10:8  Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
 continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.

KI1 10:9  Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on
 the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made
 he thee king, to do judgment and justice.

KI1 10:10  And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of
 spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such
 abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

KI1 10:11  And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in
 from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.

KI1 10:12  And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the
 LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there
 came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.

KI1 10:13  And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
 whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty.
 So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.

KI1 10:14  Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
 hundred threescore and six talents of gold,

KI1 10:15  Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the
 spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the
 country.

KI1 10:16  And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
 hundred shekels of gold went to one target.

KI1 10:17  And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of
 gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of
 Lebanon.

KI1 10:18  Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with
 the best gold.

KI1 10:19  The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
 behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two
 lions stood beside the stays.

KI1 10:20  And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon
 the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.

KI1 10:21  And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the
 vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of
 silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.

KI1 10:22  For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram:
 once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver,
 ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

KI1 10:23  So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and
 for wisdom.

KI1 10:24  And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God
 had put in his heart.

KI1 10:25  And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
 vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a
 rate year by year.

KI1 10:26  And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a
 thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he
 bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.

KI1 10:27  And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars
 made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.

KI1 10:28  And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
 king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

KI1 10:29  And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels
 of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings
 of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their
 means.

KI1 11:1  But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter
 of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and
 Hittites:

KI1 11:2  Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of
 Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for
 surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto
 these in love.

KI1 11:3  And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
 concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

KI1 11:4  For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away
 his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his
 God, as was the heart of David his father.

KI1 11:5  For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and
 after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

KI1 11:6  And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully
 after the LORD, as did David his father.

KI1 11:7  Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of
 Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination
 of the children of Ammon.

KI1 11:8  And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense
 and sacrificed unto their gods.

KI1 11:9  And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned
 from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,

KI1 11:10  And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go
 after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.

KI1 11:11  Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done
 of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have
 commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to
 thy servant.

KI1 11:12  Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's
 sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.

KI1 11:13  Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one
 tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which
 I have chosen.

KI1 11:14  And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
 Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.

KI1 11:15  For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain
 of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in
 Edom;

KI1 11:16  (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had
 cut off every male in Edom:)

KI1 11:17  That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants
 with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.

KI1 11:18  And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men
 with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt;
 which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.

KI1 11:19  And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
 gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the
 queen.

KI1 11:20  And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes
 weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the
 sons of Pharaoh.

KI1 11:21  And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and
 that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me
 depart, that I may go to mine own country.

KI1 11:22  Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that,
 behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing:
 howbeit let me go in any wise.

KI1 11:23  And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah,
 which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:

KI1 11:24  And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when
 David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and
 reigned in Damascus.

KI1 11:25  And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside
 the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.

KI1 11:26  And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's
 servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his
 hand against the king.

KI1 11:27  And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king:
 Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his
 father.

KI1 11:28  And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing
 the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge
 of the house of Joseph.

KI1 11:29  And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
 Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he
 had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:

KI1 11:30  And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in
 twelve pieces:

KI1 11:31  And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the
 LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of
 Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:

KI1 11:32  (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for
 Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of
 Israel:)

KI1 11:33  Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth
 the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the
 god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that
 which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did
 David his father.

KI1 11:34  Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I
 will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake,
 whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:

KI1 11:35  But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it
 unto thee, even ten tribes.

KI1 11:36  And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may
 have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to
 put my name there.

KI1 11:37  And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy
 soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.

KI1 11:38  And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
 thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my
 statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with
 thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel
 unto thee.

KI1 11:39  And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.

KI1 11:40  Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and
 fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death
 of Solomon.

KI1 11:41  And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his
 wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?

KI1 11:42  And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was
 forty years.

KI1 11:43  And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
 David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

KI1 12:1  And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to
 make him king.

KI1 12:2  And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in
 Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and
 Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)

KI1 12:3  That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation
 of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,

KI1 12:4  Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the
 grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us,
 lighter, and we will serve thee.

KI1 12:5  And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to
 me. And the people departed.

KI1 12:6  And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before
 Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may
 answer this people?

KI1 12:7  And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this
 people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words
 to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.

KI1 12:8  But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given
 him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which
 stood before him:

KI1 12:9  And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this
 people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put
 upon us lighter?

KI1 12:10  And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,
 saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying,
 Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt
 thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

KI1 12:11  And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add
 to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
 you with scorpions.

KI1 12:12  So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as
 the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.

KI1 12:13  And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's
 counsel that they gave him;

KI1 12:14  And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My
 father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also
 chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

KI1 12:15  Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was
 from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by
 Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

KI1 12:16  So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the
 people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have
 we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine
 own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.

KI1 12:17  But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
 Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

KI1 12:18  Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all
 Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made
 speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

KI1 12:19  So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

KI1 12:20  And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come
 again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king
 over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the
 tribe of Judah only.

KI1 12:21  And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house
 of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand
 chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to
 bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

KI1 12:22  But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

KI1 12:23  Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all
 the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,

KI1 12:24  Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your
 brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this
 thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and
 returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.

KI1 12:25  Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and
 went out from thence, and built Penuel.

KI1 12:26  And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the
 house of David:

KI1 12:27  If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at
 Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord,
 even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to
 Rehoboam king of Judah.

KI1 12:28  Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and
 said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy
 gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

KI1 12:29  And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.

KI1 12:30  And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before
 the one, even unto Dan.

KI1 12:31  And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest
 of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

KI1 12:32  And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth
 day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon
 the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made:
 and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.

KI1 12:33  So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
 fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of
 his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he
 offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.

KI1 13:1  And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the
 LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.

KI1 13:2  And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O
 altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the
 house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests
 of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be
 burnt upon thee.

KI1 13:3  And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the
 LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are
 upon it shall be poured out.

KI1 13:4  And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man
 of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his
 hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put
 forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.

KI1 13:5  The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
 according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.

KI1 13:6  And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the
 face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me
 again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored
 him again, and became as it was before.

KI1 13:7  And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh
 thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

KI1 13:8  And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half
 thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink
 water in this place:

KI1 13:9  For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no
 bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.

KI1 13:10  So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to
 Bethel.

KI1 13:11  Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told
 him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words
 which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.

KI1 13:12  And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had
 seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.

KI1 13:13  And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him
 the ass: and he rode thereon,

KI1 13:14  And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak:
 and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he
 said, I am.

KI1 13:15  Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

KI1 13:16  And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
 neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:

KI1 13:17  For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no
 bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou
 camest.

KI1 13:18  He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel
 spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into
 thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.

KI1 13:19  So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank
 water.

KI1 13:20  And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the
 LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:

KI1 13:21  And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus
 saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and
 hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,

KI1 13:22  But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place,
 of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy
 carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.

KI1 13:23  And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had
 drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had
 brought back.

KI1 13:24  And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and
 his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood
 by the carcase.

KI1 13:25  And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and
 the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where
 the old prophet dwelt.

KI1 13:26  And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
 thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word
 of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath
 torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake
 unto him.

KI1 13:27  And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
 saddled him.

KI1 13:28  And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and
 the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor
 torn the ass.

KI1 13:29  And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it
 upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to
 mourn and to bury him.

KI1 13:30  And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him,
 saying, Alas, my brother!

KI1 13:31  And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his
 sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man
 of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:

KI1 13:32  For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the
 altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are
 in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.

KI1 13:33  After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made
 again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever
 would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high
 places.

KI1 13:34  And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it
 off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

KI1 14:1  At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

KI1 14:2  And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise
 thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to
 Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be
 king over this people.

KI1 14:3  And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
 honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.

KI1 14:4  And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came
 to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by
 reason of his age.

KI1 14:5  And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to
 ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say
 unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself
 to be another woman.

KI1 14:6  And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came
 in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest
 thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.

KI1 14:7  Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I
 exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people
 Israel,

KI1 14:8  And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee:
 and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and
 who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine
 eyes;

KI1 14:9  But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast
 gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and
 hast cast me behind thy back:

KI1 14:10  Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and
 will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is
 shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of
 Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.

KI1 14:11  Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him
 that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath
 spoken it.

KI1 14:12  Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet
 enter into the city, the child shall die.

KI1 14:13  And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of
 Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good
 thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.

KI1 14:14  Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall
 cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.

KI1 14:15  For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
 water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave
 to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have
 made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.

KI1 14:16  And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did
 sin, and who made Israel to sin.

KI1 14:17  And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and
 when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;

KI1 14:18  And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according
 to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the
 prophet.

KI1 14:19  And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he
 reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Israel.

KI1 14:20  And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and
 he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.

KI1 14:21  And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty
 and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in
 Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of
 Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an
 Ammonitess.

KI1 14:22  And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him
 to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their
 fathers had done.

KI1 14:23  For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on
 every high hill, and under every green tree.

KI1 14:24  And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to
 all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the
 children of Israel.

KI1 14:25  And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
 king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:

KI1 14:26  And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the
 treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all
 the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

KI1 14:27  And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed
 them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the
 king's house.

KI1 14:28  And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that
 the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.

KI1 14:29  Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they
 not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI1 14:30  And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.

KI1 14:31  And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
 in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And
 Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

KI1 15:1  Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned
 Abijam over Judah.

KI1 15:2  Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was
 Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

KI1 15:3  And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before
 him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of
 David his father.

KI1 15:4  Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in
 Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:

KI1 15:5  Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and
 turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his
 life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.

KI1 15:6  And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his
 life.

KI1 15:7  Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was
 war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

KI1 15:8  And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of
 David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

KI1 15:9  And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over
 Judah.

KI1 15:10  And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's
 name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

KI1 15:11  And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did
 David his father.

KI1 15:12  And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the
 idols that his fathers had made.

KI1 15:13  And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen,
 because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and
 burnt it by the brook Kidron.

KI1 15:14  But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was
 perfect with the LORD all his days.

KI1 15:15  And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the
 things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and
 gold, and vessels.

KI1 15:16  And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their
 days.

KI1 15:17  And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah,
 that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

KI1 15:18  Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the
 treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's
 house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent
 them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that
 dwelt at Damascus, saying,

KI1 15:19  There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy
 father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and
 break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.

KI1 15:20  So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the
 hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and
 Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.

KI1 15:21  And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off
 building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

KI1 15:22  Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was
 exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof,
 wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of
 Benjamin, and Mizpah.

KI1 15:23  The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he
 did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the
 chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he
 was diseased in his feet.

KI1 15:24  And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
 in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his
 stead.

KI1 15:25  And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the
 second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.

KI1 15:26  And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of
 his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.

KI1 15:27  And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired
 against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the
 Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.

KI1 15:28  Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and
 reigned in his stead.

KI1 15:29  And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of
 Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed
 him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant
 Ahijah the Shilonite:

KI1 15:30  Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made
 Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel
 to anger.

KI1 15:31  Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

KI1 15:32  And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their
 days.

KI1 15:33  In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of
 Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.

KI1 15:34  And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of
 Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.

KI1 16:1  Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against
 Baasha, saying,

KI1 16:2  Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince
 over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast
 made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;

KI1 16:3  Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity
 of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of
 Nebat.

KI1 16:4  Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that
 dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.

KI1 16:5  Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might,
 are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

KI1 16:6  So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah
 his son reigned in his stead.

KI1 16:7  And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the
 word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil
 that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work
 of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.

KI1 16:8  In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son
 of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.

KI1 16:9  And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
 against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza
 steward of his house in Tirzah.

KI1 16:10  And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and
 seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.

KI1 16:11  And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on
 his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that
 pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.

KI1 16:12  Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the
 word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.

KI1 16:13  For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which
 they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God
 of Israel to anger with their vanities.

KI1 16:14  Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

KI1 16:15  In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign
 seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which
 belonged to the Philistines.

KI1 16:16  And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
 conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the
 captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.

KI1 16:17  And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they
 besieged Tirzah.

KI1 16:18  And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he
 went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him
 with fire, and died.

KI1 16:19  For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD,
 in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make
 Israel to sin.

KI1 16:20  Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought,
 are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

KI1 16:21  Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the
 people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed
 Omri.

KI1 16:22  But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that
 followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.

KI1 16:23  In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to
 reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.

KI1 16:24  And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
 silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he
 built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.

KI1 16:25  But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than
 all that were before him.

KI1 16:26  For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in
 his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to
 anger with their vanities.

KI1 16:27  Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he
 shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
 Israel?

KI1 16:28  So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab
 his son reigned in his stead.

KI1 16:29  And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab
 the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over
 Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.

KI1 16:30  And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all
 that were before him.

KI1 16:31  And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk
 in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the
 daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and
 worshipped him.

KI1 16:32  And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he
 had built in Samaria.

KI1 16:33  And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of
 Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.

KI1 16:34  In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
 foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in
 his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by
 Joshua the son of Nun.

KI1 17:1  And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said
 unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall
 not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.

KI1 17:2  And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

KI1 17:3  Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook
 Cherith, that is before Jordan.

KI1 17:4  And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have
 commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

KI1 17:5  So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went
 and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

KI1 17:6  And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread
 and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

KI1 17:7  And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because
 there had been no rain in the land.

KI1 17:8  And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

KI1 17:9  Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell
 there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

KI1 17:10  So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate
 of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he
 called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel,
 that I may drink.

KI1 17:11  And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring
 me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.

KI1 17:12  And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an
 handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am
 gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that
 we may eat it, and die.

KI1 17:13  And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but
 make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for
 thee and for thy son.

KI1 17:14  For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not
 waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD
 sendeth rain upon the earth.

KI1 17:15  And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and
 he, and her house, did eat many days.

KI1 17:16  And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil
 fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.

KI1 17:17  And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the
 woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore,
 that there was no breath left in him.

KI1 17:18  And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of
 God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?

KI1 17:19  And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her
 bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his
 own bed.

KI1 17:20  And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also
 brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?

KI1 17:21  And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto
 the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come
 into him again.

KI1 17:22  And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child
 came into him again, and he revived.

KI1 17:23  And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber
 into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy
 son liveth.

KI1 17:24  And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man
 of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.

KI1 18:1  And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came
 to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will
 send rain upon the earth.

KI1 18:2  And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore
 famine in Samaria.

KI1 18:3  And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now
 Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:

KI1 18:4  For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that
 Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed
 them with bread and water.)

KI1 18:5  And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of
 water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses
 and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.

KI1 18:6  So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab
 went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.

KI1 18:7  And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew
 him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?

KI1 18:8  And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.

KI1 18:9  And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy
 servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?

KI1 18:10  As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither
 my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he
 took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.

KI1 18:11  And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.

KI1 18:12  And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the
 Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come
 and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant
 fear the LORD from my youth.

KI1 18:13  Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets
 of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a
 cave, and fed them with bread and water?

KI1 18:14  And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and
 he shall slay me.

KI1 18:15  And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I
 will surely shew myself unto him to day.

KI1 18:16  So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet
 Elijah.

KI1 18:17  And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him,
 Art thou he that troubleth Israel?

KI1 18:18  And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy
 father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and
 thou hast followed Baalim.

KI1 18:19  Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount
 Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets
 of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.

KI1 18:20  So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
 prophets together unto mount Carmel.

KI1 18:21  And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye
 between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then
 follow him. And the people answered him not a word.

KI1 18:22  Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet
 of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.

KI1 18:23  Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one
 bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no
 fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put
 no fire under:

KI1 18:24  And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name
 of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the
 people answered and said, It is well spoken.

KI1 18:25  And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock
 for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of
 your gods, but put no fire under.

KI1 18:26  And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed
 it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O
 Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped
 upon the altar which was made.

KI1 18:27  And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry
 aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in
 a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.

KI1 18:28  And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with
 knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.

KI1 18:29  And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until
 the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither
 voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.

KI1 18:30  And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the
 people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was
 broken down.

KI1 18:31  And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes
 of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel
 shall be thy name:

KI1 18:32  And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and
 he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of
 seed.

KI1 18:33  And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and
 laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on
 the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

KI1 18:34  And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time.
 And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.

KI1 18:35  And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench
 also with water.

KI1 18:36  And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
 sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham,
 Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in
 Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at
 thy word.

KI1 18:37  Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art
 the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.

KI1 18:38  Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt
 sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the
 water that was in the trench.

KI1 18:39  And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they
 said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.

KI1 18:40  And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one
 of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook
 Kishon, and slew them there.

KI1 18:41  And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is
 a sound of abundance of rain.

KI1 18:42  So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top
 of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between
 his knees,

KI1 18:43  And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went
 up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven
 times.

KI1 18:44  And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there
 ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up,
 say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down that the rain stop thee
 not.

KI1 18:45  And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black
 with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to
 Jezreel.

KI1 18:46  And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins,
 and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

KI1 19:1  And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had
 slain all the prophets with the sword.

KI1 19:2  Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do
 to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to
 morrow about this time.

KI1 19:3  And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to
 Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.

KI1 19:4  But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and
 sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might
 die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not
 better than my fathers.

KI1 19:5  And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel
 touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.

KI1 19:6  And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and
 a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down
 again.

KI1 19:7  And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched
 him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.

KI1 19:8  And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that
 meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.

KI1 19:9  And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the
 word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here,
 Elijah?

KI1 19:10  And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for
 the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars,
 and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they
 seek my life, to take it away.

KI1 19:11  And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.
 And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the
 mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was
 not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not
 in the earthquake:

KI1 19:12  And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire:
 and after the fire a still small voice.

KI1 19:13  And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his
 mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And,
 behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?

KI1 19:14  And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts:
 because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine
 altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left;
 and they seek my life, to take it away.

KI1 19:15  And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness
 of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:

KI1 19:16  And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel:
 and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet
 in thy room.

KI1 19:17  And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of
 Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall
 Elisha slay.

KI1 19:18  Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which
 have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.

KI1 19:19  So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was
 plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and
 Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.

KI1 19:20  And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray
 thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said
 unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?

KI1 19:21  And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew
 them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto
 the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and
 ministered unto him.

KI1 20:1  And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and
 there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he
 went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.

KI1 20:2  And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said
 unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,

KI1 20:3  Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children,
 even the goodliest, are mine.

KI1 20:4  And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according
 to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.

KI1 20:5  And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad,
 saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy
 silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;

KI1 20:6  Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and
 they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall
 be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their
 hand, and take it away.

KI1 20:7  Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said,
 Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me
 for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I
 denied him not.

KI1 20:8  And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto
 him, nor consent.

KI1 20:9  Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the
 king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but
 this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word
 again.

KI1 20:10  And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and
 more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the
 people that follow me.

KI1 20:11  And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that
 girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.

KI1 20:12  And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was
 drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants,
 Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.

KI1 20:13  And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying,
 Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will
 deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

KI1 20:14  And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by
 the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order
 the battle? And he answered, Thou.

KI1 20:15  Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and
 they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the
 people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.

KI1 20:16  And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk
 in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.

KI1 20:17  And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first;
 and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of
 Samaria.

KI1 20:18  And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or
 whether they be come out for war, take them alive.

KI1 20:19  So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the
 city, and the army which followed them.

KI1 20:20  And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel
 pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the
 horsemen.

KI1 20:21  And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots,
 and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

KI1 20:22  And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go,
 strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return
 of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.

KI1 20:23  And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are
 gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight
 against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.

KI1 20:24  And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his
 place, and put captains in their rooms:

KI1 20:25  And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse
 for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the
 plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their
 voice, and did so.

KI1 20:26  And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
 numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.

KI1 20:27  And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and
 went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two
 little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.

KI1 20:28  And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and
 said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God
 of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all
 this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

KI1 20:29  And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it
 was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of
 Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.

KI1 20:30  But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell
 upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad
 fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.

KI1 20:31  And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the
 kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put
 sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of
 Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.

KI1 20:32  So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their
 heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith,
 I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.

KI1 20:33  Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from
 him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he
 said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to
 come up into the chariot.

KI1 20:34  And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from
 thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus,
 as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this
 covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.

KI1 20:35  And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
 neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused
 to smite him.

KI1 20:36  Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the
 LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.
 And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.

KI1 20:37  Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the
 man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.

KI1 20:38  So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and
 disguised himself with ashes upon his face.

KI1 20:39  And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy
 servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned
 aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he
 be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a
 talent of silver.

KI1 20:40  And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the
 king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided
 it.

KI1 20:41  And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king
 of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.

KI1 20:42  And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go
 out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy
 life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.

KI1 20:43  And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and
 came to Samaria.

KI1 21:1  And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite
 had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of
 Samaria.

KI1 21:2  And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may
 have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will
 give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I
 will give thee the worth of it in money.

KI1 21:3  And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give
 the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.

KI1 21:4  And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word
 which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not
 give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his
 bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.

KI1 21:5  But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy
 spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?

KI1 21:6  And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and
 said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I
 will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee
 my vineyard.

KI1 21:7  And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom
 of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give
 thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.

KI1 21:8  So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his
 seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his
 city, dwelling with Naboth.

KI1 21:9  And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth
 on high among the people:

KI1 21:10  And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against
 him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him
 out, and stone him, that he may die.

KI1 21:11  And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the
 inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was
 written in the letters which she had sent unto them.

KI1 21:12  They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.

KI1 21:13  And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him:
 and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the
 presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then
 they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he
 died.

KI1 21:14  Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.

KI1 21:15  And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and
 was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard
 of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth
 is not alive, but dead.

KI1 21:16  And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab
 rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take
 possession of it.

KI1 21:17  And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

KI1 21:18  Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:
 behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess
 it.

KI1 21:19  And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast
 thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him,
 saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of
 Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.

KI1 21:20  And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he
 answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil
 in the sight of the LORD.

KI1 21:21  Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
 posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and
 him that is shut up and left in Israel,

KI1 21:22  And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of
 Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation
 wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.

KI1 21:23  And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
 Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.

KI1 21:24  Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that
 dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.

KI1 21:25  But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work
 wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.

KI1 21:26  And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all
 things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of
 Israel.

KI1 21:27  And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his
 clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in
 sackcloth, and went softly.

KI1 21:28  And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

KI1 21:29  Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth
 himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's
 days will I bring the evil upon his house.

KI1 22:1  And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.

KI1 22:2  And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of
 Judah came down to the king of Israel.

KI1 22:3  And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in
 Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king
 of Syria?

KI1 22:4  And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to
 Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art,
 my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.

KI1 22:5  And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee,
 at the word of the LORD to day.

KI1 22:6  Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four
 hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle,
 or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into
 the hand of the king.

KI1 22:7  And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
 besides, that we might enquire of him?

KI1 22:8  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man,
 Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him;
 for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said,
 Let not the king say so.

KI1 22:9  Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither
 Micaiah the son of Imlah.

KI1 22:10  And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on
 his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the
 gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.

KI1 22:11  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he
 said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou
 have consumed them.

KI1 22:12  And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
 Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's
 hand.

KI1 22:13  And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,
 saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with
 one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and
 speak that which is good.

KI1 22:14  And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me,
 that will I speak.

KI1 22:15  So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall
 we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered
 him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the
 king.

KI1 22:16  And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that
 thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?

KI1 22:17  And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep
 that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them
 return every man to his house in peace.

KI1 22:18  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
 that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?

KI1 22:19  And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the
 LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his
 right hand and on his left.

KI1 22:20  And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and
 fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that
 manner.

KI1 22:21  And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said,
 I will persuade him.

KI1 22:22  And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
 forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he
 said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.

KI1 22:23  Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth
 of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.

KI1 22:24  But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on
 the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak
 unto thee?

KI1 22:25  And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou
 shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

KI1 22:26  And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto
 Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;

KI1 22:27  And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and
 feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come
 in peace.

KI1 22:28  And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not
 spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.

KI1 22:29  So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to
 Ramothgilead.

KI1 22:30  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
 myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of
 Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.

KI1 22:31  But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had
 rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only
 with the king of Israel.

KI1 22:32  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
 Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned
 aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.

KI1 22:33  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived
 that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.

KI1 22:34  And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
 Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver
 of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am
 wounded.

KI1 22:35  And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his
 chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the
 wound into the midst of the chariot.

KI1 22:36  And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going
 down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own
 country.

KI1 22:37  So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the
 king in Samaria.

KI1 22:38  And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs
 licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word
 of the LORD which he spake.

KI1 22:39  Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory
 house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written
 in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

KI1 22:40  So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his
 stead.

KI1 22:41  And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the
 fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

KI1 22:42  Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign;
 and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
 Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

KI1 22:43  And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside
 from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the
 high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet
 in the high places.

KI1 22:44  And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

KI1 22:45  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
 shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
 of the kings of Judah?

KI1 22:46  And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his
 father Asa, he took out of the land.

KI1 22:47  There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.

KI1 22:48  Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but
 they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.

KI1 22:49  Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants
 go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.

KI1 22:50  And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
 fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his
 stead.

KI1 22:51  Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the
 seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over
 Israel.

KI1 22:52  And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of
 his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son
 of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:

KI1 22:53  For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the
 LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

KI2 1:1  Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

KI2 1:2  And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was
 in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go,
 enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this
 disease.

KI2 1:3  But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to
 meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not
 because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the
 god of Ekron?

KI2 1:4  Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that
 bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.

KI2 1:5  And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why
 are ye now turned back?

KI2 1:6  And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto
 us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith
 the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest
 to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down
 from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

KI2 1:7  And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet
 you, and told you these words?

KI2 1:8  And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of
 leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.

KI2 1:9  Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he
 went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto
 him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.

KI2 1:10  And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man
 of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty.
 And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.

KI2 1:11  Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty.
 And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said,
 Come down quickly.

KI2 1:12  And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let
 fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of
 God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.

KI2 1:13  And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And
 the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before
 Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let
 my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.

KI2 1:14  Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
 captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now
 be precious in thy sight.

KI2 1:15  And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not
 afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.

KI2 1:16  And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast
 sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because
 there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not
 come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

KI2 1:17  So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken.
 And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of
 Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.

KI2 1:18  Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

KI2 2:1  And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by
 a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.

KI2 2:2  And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD
 hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as
 thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.

KI2 2:3  And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to
 Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy
 master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.

KI2 2:4  And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the
 LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy
 soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.

KI2 2:5  And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and
 said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy
 head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.

KI2 2:6  And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath
 sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I
 will not leave thee. And they two went on.

KI2 2:7  And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar
 off: and they two stood by Jordan.

KI2 2:8  And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the
 waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over
 on dry ground.

KI2 2:9  And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto
 Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And
 Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.

KI2 2:10  And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see
 me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall
 not be so.

KI2 2:11  And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
 behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them
 both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.

KI2 2:12  And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of
 Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of
 his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.

KI2 2:13  He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went
 back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;

KI2 2:14  And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the
 waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had
 smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.

KI2 2:15  And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw
 him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to
 meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.

KI2 2:16  And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty
 strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure
 the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or
 into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.

KI2 2:17  And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent
 therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.

KI2 2:18  And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said
 unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

KI2 2:19  And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the
 situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is
 naught, and the ground barren.

KI2 2:20  And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they
 brought it to him.

KI2 2:21  And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt
 in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there
 shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.

KI2 2:22  So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of
 Elisha which he spake.

KI2 2:23  And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the
 way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and
 said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.

KI2 2:24  And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name
 of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare
 forty and two children of them.

KI2 2:25  And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned
 to Samaria.

KI2 3:1  Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the
 eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.

KI2 3:2  And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his
 father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his
 father had made.

KI2 3:3  Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
 which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

KI2 3:4  And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king
 of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the
 wool.

KI2 3:5  But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
 rebelled against the king of Israel.

KI2 3:6  And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all
 Israel.

KI2 3:7  And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The
 king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to
 battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy
 people, and my horses as thy horses.

KI2 3:8  And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way
 through the wilderness of Edom.

KI2 3:9  So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of
 Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no
 water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.

KI2 3:10  And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these
 three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!

KI2 3:11  But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that
 we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants
 answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on
 the hands of Elijah.

KI2 3:12  And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king
 of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.

KI2 3:13  And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee?
 get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother.
 And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these
 three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.

KI2 3:14  And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand,
 surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of
 Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.

KI2 3:15  But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel
 played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.

KI2 3:16  And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.

KI2 3:17  For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see
 rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both
 ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.

KI2 3:18  And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will
 deliver the Moabites also into your hand.

KI2 3:19  And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and
 shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good
 piece of land with stones.

KI2 3:20  And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was
 offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country
 was filled with water.

KI2 3:21  And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight
 against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and
 upward, and stood in the border.

KI2 3:22  And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the
 water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:

KI2 3:23  And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they
 have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.

KI2 3:24  And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and
 smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward
 smiting the Moabites, even in their country.

KI2 3:25  And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast
 every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of
 water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the
 stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.

KI2 3:26  And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him,
 he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even
 unto the king of Edom: but they could not.

KI2 3:27  Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
 stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was
 great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned
 to their own land.

KI2 4:1  Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
 prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou
 knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take
 unto him my two sons to be bondmen.

KI2 4:2  And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast
 thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the
 house, save a pot of oil.

KI2 4:3  Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,
 even empty vessels; borrow not a few.

KI2 4:4  And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon
 thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside
 that which is full.

KI2 4:5  So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons,
 who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.

KI2 4:6  And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto
 her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel
 more. And the oil stayed.

KI2 4:7  Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the
 oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.

KI2 4:8  And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great
 woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he
 passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.

KI2 4:9  And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an
 holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.

KI2 4:10  Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us
 set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it
 shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.

KI2 4:11  And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the
 chamber, and lay there.

KI2 4:12  And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he
 had called her, she stood before him.

KI2 4:13  And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
 careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou
 be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I
 dwell among mine own people.

KI2 4:14  And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered,
 Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

KI2 4:15  And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the
 door.

KI2 4:16  And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou
 shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie
 unto thine handmaid.

KI2 4:17  And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha
 had said unto her, according to the time of life.

KI2 4:18  And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to
 his father to the reapers.

KI2 4:19  And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad,
 Carry him to his mother.

KI2 4:20  And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on
 her knees till noon, and then died.

KI2 4:21  And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut
 the door upon him, and went out.

KI2 4:22  And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one
 of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and
 come again.

KI2 4:23  And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new
 moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.

KI2 4:24  Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go
 forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.

KI2 4:25  So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came
 to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his
 servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:

KI2 4:26  Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with
 thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she
 answered, It is well:

KI2 4:27  And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by
 the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said,
 Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it
 from me, and hath not told me.

KI2 4:28  Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not
 deceive me?

KI2 4:29  Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine
 hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute
 thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.

KI2 4:30  And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
 liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.

KI2 4:31  And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face
 of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went
 again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.

KI2 4:32  And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was
 dead, and laid upon his bed.

KI2 4:33  He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed
 unto the LORD.

KI2 4:34  And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his
 mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and
 stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.

KI2 4:35  Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
 up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and
 the child opened his eyes.

KI2 4:36  And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called
 her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.

KI2 4:37  Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the
 ground, and took up her son, and went out.

KI2 4:38  And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land;
 and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his
 servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the
 prophets.

KI2 4:39  And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild
 vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them
 into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.

KI2 4:40  So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they
 were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of
 God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.

KI2 4:41  But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he
 said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm
 in the pot.

KI2 4:42  And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God
 bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn
 in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.

KI2 4:43  And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?
 He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD,
 They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.

KI2 4:44  So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
 according to the word of the LORD.

KI2 5:1  Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man
 with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given
 deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a
 leper.

KI2 5:2  And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away
 captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's
 wife.

KI2 5:3  And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the
 prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.

KI2 5:4  And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the
 maid that is of the land of Israel.

KI2 5:5  And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto
 the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of
 silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.

KI2 5:6  And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this
 letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant
 to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.

KI2 5:7  And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that
 he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this
 man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I
 pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

KI2 5:8  And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of
 Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast
 thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there
 is a prophet in Israel.

KI2 5:9  So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the
 door of the house of Elisha.

KI2 5:10  And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan
 seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.

KI2 5:11  But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He
 will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his
 God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.

KI2 5:12  Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the
 waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went
 away in a rage.

KI2 5:13  And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father,
 if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done
 it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?

KI2 5:14  Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
 according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto
 the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

KI2 5:15  And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and
 came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no
 God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a
 blessing of thy servant.

KI2 5:16  But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive
 none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.

KI2 5:17  And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy
 servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer
 neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.

KI2 5:18  In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth
 into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I
 bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of
 Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.

KI2 5:19  And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little
 way.

KI2 5:20  But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my
 master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that
 which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take
 somewhat of him.

KI2 5:21  So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running
 after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all
 well?

KI2 5:22  And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold,
 even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons
 of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes
 of garments.

KI2 5:23  And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and
 bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and
 laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.

KI2 5:24  And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and
 bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.

KI2 5:25  But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto
 him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.

KI2 5:26  And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man
 turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive
 money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and
 oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?

KI2 5:27  The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy
 seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.

KI2 6:1  And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place
 where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.

KI2 6:2  Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a
 beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered,
 Go ye.

KI2 6:3  And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And
 he answered, I will go.

KI2 6:4  So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down
 wood.

KI2 6:5  But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and
 he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.

KI2 6:6  And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place.
 And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.

KI2 6:7  Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and
 took it.

KI2 6:8  Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with
 his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.

KI2 6:9  And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that
 thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.

KI2 6:10  And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told
 him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.

KI2 6:11  Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this
 thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me
 which of us is for the king of Israel?

KI2 6:12  And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the
 prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou
 speakest in thy bedchamber.

KI2 6:13  And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him.
 And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.

KI2 6:14  Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and
 they came by night, and compassed the city about.

KI2 6:15  And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone
 forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And
 his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?

KI2 6:16  And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than
 they that be with them.

KI2 6:17  And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that
 he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and,
 behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about
 Elisha.

KI2 6:18  And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and
 said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with
 blindness according to the word of Elisha.

KI2 6:19  And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the
 city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led
 them to Samaria.

KI2 6:20  And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha
 said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD
 opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of
 Samaria.

KI2 6:21  And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father,
 shall I smite them? shall I smite them?

KI2 6:22  And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those
 whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and
 water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.

KI2 6:23  And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and
 drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of
 Syria came no more into the land of Israel.

KI2 6:24  And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered
 all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.

KI2 6:25  And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged
 it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the
 fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.

KI2 6:26  And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a
 woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.

KI2 6:27  And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee?
 out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?

KI2 6:28  And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This
 woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat
 my son to morrow.

KI2 6:29  So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next
 day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.

KI2 6:30  And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that
 he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people
 looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.

KI2 6:31  Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha
 the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.

KI2 6:32  But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the
 king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said
 to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine
 head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at
 the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?

KI2 6:33  And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down
 unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait
 for the LORD any longer?

KI2 7:1  Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD,
 To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a
 shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.

KI2 7:2  Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and
 said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?
 And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat
 thereof.

KI2 7:3  And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and
 they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?

KI2 7:4  If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the
 city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now
 therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us
 alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.

KI2 7:5  And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians:
 and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria,
 behold, there was no man there.

KI2 7:6  For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of
 chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they
 said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings
 of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.

KI2 7:7  Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents,
 and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for
 their life.

KI2 7:8  And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they
 went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and
 gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into
 another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.

KI2 7:9  Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of
 good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some
 mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the
 king's household.

KI2 7:10  So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told
 them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no
 man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the
 tents as they were.

KI2 7:11  And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house
 within.

KI2 7:12  And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will
 now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry;
 therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field,
 saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get
 into the city.

KI2 7:13  And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray
 thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city,
 (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold,
 I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are
 consumed:) and let us send and see.

KI2 7:14  They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the
 host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

KI2 7:15  And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full
 of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And
 the messengers returned, and told the king.

KI2 7:16  And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a
 measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a
 shekel, according to the word of the LORD.

KI2 7:17  And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the
 charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died,
 as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.

KI2 7:18  And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying,
 Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a
 shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:

KI2 7:19  And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the
 LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said,
 Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

KI2 7:20  And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the
 gate, and he died.

KI2 8:1  Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life,
 saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou
 canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come
 upon the land seven years.

KI2 8:2  And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and
 she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines
 seven years.

KI2 8:3  And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned
 out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king
 for her house and for her land.

KI2 8:4  And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying,
 Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.

KI2 8:5  And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a
 dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to
 life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My
 lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to
 life.

KI2 8:6  And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed
 unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the
 fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.

KI2 8:7  And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick;
 and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.

KI2 8:8  And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go,
 meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover
 of this disease?

KI2 8:9  So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every
 good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before
 him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying,
 Shall I recover of this disease?

KI2 8:10  And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly
 recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.

KI2 8:11  And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and
 the man of God wept.

KI2 8:12  And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know
 the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds
 wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and
 wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.

KI2 8:13  And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do
 this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou
 shalt be king over Syria.

KI2 8:14  So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him,
 What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest
 surely recover.

KI2 8:15  And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and
 dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael
 reigned in his stead.

KI2 8:16  And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
 Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of
 Judah began to reign.

KI2 8:17  Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
 reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

KI2 8:18  And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of
 Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight
 of the LORD.

KI2 8:19  Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as
 he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.

KI2 8:20  In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a
 king over themselves.

KI2 8:21  So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he
 rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the
 captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.

KI2 8:22  Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then
 Libnah revolted at the same time.

KI2 8:23  And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI2 8:24  And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
 in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 8:25  In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did
 Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.

KI2 8:26  Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he
 reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the
 daughter of Omri king of Israel.

KI2 8:27  And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the
 sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the
 house of Ahab.

KI2 8:28  And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king
 of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.

KI2 8:29  And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which
 the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of
 Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram
 the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

KI2 9:1  And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and
 said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and
 go to Ramothgilead:

KI2 9:2  And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
 Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among
 his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;

KI2 9:3  Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith
 the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and
 flee, and tarry not.

KI2 9:4  So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
 Ramothgilead.

KI2 9:5  And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and
 he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of
 all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.

KI2 9:6  And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his
 head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed
 thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.

KI2 9:7  And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge
 the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants
 of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.

KI2 9:8  For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab
 him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in
 Israel:

KI2 9:9  And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son
 of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:

KI2 9:10  And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there
 shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.

KI2 9:11  Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto
 him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto
 them, Ye know the man, and his communication.

KI2 9:12  And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus
 spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over
 Israel.

KI2 9:13  Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under
 him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.

KI2 9:14  So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against
 Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael
 king of Syria.

KI2 9:15  But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
 which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.)
 And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out
 of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.

KI2 9:16  So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.
 And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.

KI2 9:17  And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the
 company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take
 an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?

KI2 9:18  So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the
 king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee
 behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he
 cometh not again.

KI2 9:19  Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said,
 Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do
 with peace? turn thee behind me.

KI2 9:20  And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not
 again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he
 driveth furiously.

KI2 9:21  And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram
 king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and
 they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the
 Jezreelite.

KI2 9:22  And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace,
 Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother
 Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?

KI2 9:23  And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is
 treachery, O Ahaziah.

KI2 9:24  And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between
 his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his
 chariot.

KI2 9:25  Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the
 portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I
 and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon
 him;

KI2 9:26  Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of
 his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the
 LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according
 to the word of the LORD.

KI2 9:27  But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way
 of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also
 in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam.
 And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.

KI2 9:28  And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried
 him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.

KI2 9:29  And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to
 reign over Judah.

KI2 9:30  And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she
 painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.

KI2 9:31  And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who
 slew his master?

KI2 9:32  And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?
 who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.

KI2 9:33  And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her
 blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under
 foot.

KI2 9:34  And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now
 this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.

KI2 9:35  And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the
 skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

KI2 9:36  Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the
 word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
 In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:

KI2 9:37  And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
 field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.

KI2 10:1  And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and
 sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that
 brought up Ahab's children, saying,

KI2 10:2  Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons
 are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city
 also, and armour;

KI2 10:3  Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him
 on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.

KI2 10:4  But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood
 not before him: how then shall we stand?

KI2 10:5  And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the
 elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We
 are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make
 any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.

KI2 10:6  Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be
 mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your
 master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the
 king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city,
 which brought them up.

KI2 10:7  And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the
 king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and
 sent him them to Jezreel.

KI2 10:8  And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought
 the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the
 entering in of the gate until the morning.

KI2 10:9  And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and
 said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my
 master, and slew him: but who slew all these?

KI2 10:10  Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word
 of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD
 hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.

KI2 10:11  So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and
 all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none
 remaining.

KI2 10:12  And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the
 shearing house in the way,

KI2 10:13  Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who
 are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to
 salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.

KI2 10:14  And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew
 them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left
 he any of them.

KI2 10:15  And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of
 Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine
 heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If
 it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to
 him into the chariot.

KI2 10:16  And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they
 made him ride in his chariot.

KI2 10:17  And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in
 Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD,
 which he spake to Elijah.

KI2 10:18  And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab
 served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.

KI2 10:19  Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
 servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great
 sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But
 Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers
 of Baal.

KI2 10:20  And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
 proclaimed it.

KI2 10:21  And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal
 came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the
 house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.

KI2 10:22  And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments
 for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.

KI2 10:23  And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of
 Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be
 here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal
 only.

KI2 10:24  And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu
 appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have
 brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for
 the life of him.

KI2 10:25  And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the
 burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and
 slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the
 sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city
 of the house of Baal.

KI2 10:26  And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and
 burned them.

KI2 10:27  And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of
 Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.

KI2 10:28  Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

KI2 10:29  Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel
 to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that
 were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.

KI2 10:30  And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
 executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of
 Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth
 generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.

KI2 10:31  But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel
 with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made
 Israel to sin.

KI2 10:32  In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote
 them in all the coasts of Israel;

KI2 10:33  From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the
 Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even
 Gilead and Bashan.

KI2 10:34  Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his
 might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
 Israel?

KI2 10:35  And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And
 Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 10:36  And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and
 eight years.

KI2 11:1  And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead,
 she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.

KI2 11:2  But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took
 Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons which were
 slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from
 Athaliah, so that he was not slain.

KI2 11:3  And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And
 Athaliah did reign over the land.

KI2 11:4  And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
 hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the
 house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them
 in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.

KI2 11:5  And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A
 third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the
 watch of the king's house;

KI2 11:6  And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the
 gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be
 not broken down.

KI2 11:7  And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they
 shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.

KI2 11:8  And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons
 in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be
 ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.

KI2 11:9  And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that
 Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to
 come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came
 to Jehoiada the priest.

KI2 11:10  And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's
 spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.

KI2 11:11  And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round
 about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the
 temple, along by the altar and the temple.

KI2 11:12  And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and
 gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they
 clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.

KI2 11:13  And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people,
 she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.

KI2 11:14  And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the
 manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the
 people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her
 clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.

KI2 11:15  But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the
 officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges:
 and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let
 her not be slain in the house of the LORD.

KI2 11:16  And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the
 horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.

KI2 11:17  And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the
 people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the king also and the
 people.

KI2 11:18  And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and
 brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and
 slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed
 officers over the house of the LORD.

KI2 11:19  And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the
 guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from
 the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the
 king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.

KI2 11:20  And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet:
 and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.

KI2 11:21  Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.

KI2 12:1  In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years
 reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba.

KI2 12:2  And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his
 days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

KI2 12:3  But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed
 and burnt incense in the high places.

KI2 12:4  And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated
 things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every
 one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the
 money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,

KI2 12:5  Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and
 let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be
 found.

KI2 12:6  But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash
 the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.

KI2 12:7  Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other
 priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now
 therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the
 breaches of the house.

KI2 12:8  And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people,
 neither to repair the breaches of the house.

KI2 12:9  But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of
 it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the
 house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the
 money that was brought into the house of the LORD.

KI2 12:10  And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest,
 that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags,
 and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.

KI2 12:11  And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did
 the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it
 out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,

KI2 12:12  And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed
 stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was
 laid out for the house to repair it.

KI2 12:13  Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of
 silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of
 silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:

KI2 12:14  But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house
 of the LORD.

KI2 12:15  Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
 delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.

KI2 12:16  The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house
 of the LORD: it was the priests'.

KI2 12:17  Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took
 it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.

KI2 12:18  And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
 Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had
 dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found
 in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent
 it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.

KI2 12:19  And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI2 12:20  And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the
 house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.

KI2 12:21  For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer,
 his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers
 in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 13:1  In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of
 Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and
 reigned seventeen years.

KI2 13:2  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed
 the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed
 not therefrom.

KI2 13:3  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
 delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of
 Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.

KI2 13:4  And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for
 he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.

KI2 13:5  (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under
 the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as
 beforetime.

KI2 13:6  Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
 Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the
 grove also in Samaria.)

KI2 13:7  Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty
 horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria
 had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.

KI2 13:8  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his
 might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
 Israel?

KI2 13:9  And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria:
 and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 13:10  In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash
 the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen
 years.

KI2 13:11  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed
 not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but
 he walked therein.

KI2 13:12  And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his
 might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written
 in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

KI2 13:13  And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne:
 and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.

KI2 13:14  Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And
 Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and
 said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
 thereof.

KI2 13:15  And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him
 bow and arrows.

KI2 13:16  And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And
 he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.

KI2 13:17  And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha
 said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD's
 deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite
 the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.

KI2 13:18  And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the
 king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.

KI2 13:19  And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have
 smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst
 consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.

KI2 13:20  And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites
 invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

KI2 13:21  And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they
 spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and
 when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and
 stood up on his feet.

KI2 13:22  But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.

KI2 13:23  And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and
 had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and
 Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as
 yet.

KI2 13:24  So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his
 stead.

KI2 13:25  And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
 Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of
 Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the
 cities of Israel.

KI2 14:1  In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned
 Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.

KI2 14:2  He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned
 twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of
 Jerusalem.

KI2 14:3  And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not
 like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father
 did.

KI2 14:4  Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did
 sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.

KI2 14:5  And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his
 hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.

KI2 14:6  But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that
 which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded,
 saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the
 children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death
 for his own sin.

KI2 14:7  He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by
 war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.

KI2 14:8  Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of
 Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.

KI2 14:9  And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
 The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,
 saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast
 that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.

KI2 14:10  Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up:
 glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt,
 that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?

KI2 14:11  But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went
 up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at
 Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

KI2 14:12  And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every
 man to their tents.

KI2 14:13  And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of
 Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake
 down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate,
 four hundred cubits.

KI2 14:14  And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were
 found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and
 hostages, and returned to Samaria.

KI2 14:15  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and
 how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book
 of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

KI2 14:16  And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with
 the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 14:17  And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of
 Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

KI2 14:18  And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the
 book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI2 14:19  Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to
 Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.

KI2 14:20  And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with
 his fathers in the city of David.

KI2 14:21  And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years
 old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.

KI2 14:22  He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept
 with his fathers.

KI2 14:23  In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah
 Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and
 reigned forty and one years.

KI2 14:24  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed
 not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

KI2 14:25  He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the
 sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he
 spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet,
 which was of Gathhepher.

KI2 14:26  For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter:
 for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.

KI2 14:27  And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from
 under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.

KI2 14:28  Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his
 might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which
 belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the
 chronicles of the kings of Israel?

KI2 14:29  And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel;
 and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 15:1  In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began
 Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.

KI2 15:2  Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two
 and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jecholiah of
 Jerusalem.

KI2 15:3  And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according
 to all that his father Amaziah had done;

KI2 15:4  Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and
 burnt incense still on the high places.

KI2 15:5  And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of
 his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king's son was over
 the house, judging the people of the land.

KI2 15:6  And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they
 not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI2 15:7  So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his
 fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 15:8  In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah
 the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.

KI2 15:9  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
 fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
 who made Israel to sin.

KI2 15:10  And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him
 before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

KI2 15:11  And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written
 in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

KI2 15:12  This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy
 sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation. And so it
 came to pass.

KI2 15:13  Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth
 year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.

KI2 15:14  For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
 Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and
 reigned in his stead.

KI2 15:15  And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he
 made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
 Israel.

KI2 15:16  Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
 coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he
 smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.

KI2 15:17  In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
 Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in
 Samaria.

KI2 15:18  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed
 not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel
 to sin.

KI2 15:19  And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave
 Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm
 the kingdom in his hand.

KI2 15:20  And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men
 of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of
 Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the
 land.

KI2 15:21  And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they
 not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

KI2 15:22  And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in
 his stead.

KI2 15:23  In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of
 Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.

KI2 15:24  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed
 not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

KI2 15:25  But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against
 him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob
 and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and
 reigned in his room.

KI2 15:26  And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
 behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
 Israel.

KI2 15:27  In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son
 of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.

KI2 15:28  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed
 not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

KI2 15:29  In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of
 Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and
 Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them
 captive to Assyria.

KI2 15:30  And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son
 of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the
 twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

KI2 15:31  And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they
 are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

KI2 15:32  In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began
 Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.

KI2 15:33  Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he
 reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerusha, the
 daughter of Zadok.

KI2 15:34  And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did
 according to all that his father Uzziah had done.

KI2 15:35  Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and
 burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the
 house of the LORD.

KI2 15:36  Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they
 not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI2 15:37  In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of
 Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

KI2 15:38  And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
 in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 16:1  In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of
 Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

KI2 16:2  Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen
 years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD
 his God, like David his father.

KI2 16:3  But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his
 son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen,
 whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.

KI2 16:4  And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the
 hills, and under every green tree.

KI2 16:5  Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel
 came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome
 him.

KI2 16:6  At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave
 the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this
 day.

KI2 16:7  So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I
 am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king
 of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against
 me.

KI2 16:8  And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the
 LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present
 to the king of Assyria.

KI2 16:9  And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria
 went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive
 to Kir, and slew Rezin.

KI2 16:10  And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
 Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah
 the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all
 the workmanship thereof.

KI2 16:11  And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz
 had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came
 from Damascus.

KI2 16:12  And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar:
 and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.

KI2 16:13  And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured
 his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the
 altar.

KI2 16:14  And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD,
 from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the
 LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.

KI2 16:15  And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great
 altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the
 king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all
 the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings;
 and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood
 of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.

KI2 16:16  Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
 commanded.

KI2 16:17  And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the
 laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were
 under it, and put it upon the pavement of stones.

KI2 16:18  And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and
 the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king
 of Assyria.

KI2 16:19  Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written
 in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI2 16:20  And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
 in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 17:1  In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of
 Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.

KI2 17:2  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as
 the kings of Israel that were before him.

KI2 17:3  Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became
 his servant, and gave him presents.

KI2 17:4  And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent
 messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of
 Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him
 up, and bound him in prison.

KI2 17:5  Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up
 to Samaria, and besieged it three years.

KI2 17:6  In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and
 carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by
 the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

KI2 17:7  For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the
 LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from
 under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,

KI2 17:8  And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out
 from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they
 had made.

KI2 17:9  And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not
 right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all
 their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

KI2 17:10  And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under
 every green tree:

KI2 17:11  And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the
 heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to
 provoke the LORD to anger:

KI2 17:12  For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall
 not do this thing.

KI2 17:13  Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the
 prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep
 my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded
 your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.

KI2 17:14  Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like
 to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.

KI2 17:15  And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with
 their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they
 followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round
 about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not
 do like them.

KI2 17:16  And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made
 them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the
 host of heaven, and served Baal.

KI2 17:17  And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the
 fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil
 in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

KI2 17:18  Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out
 of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.

KI2 17:19  Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but
 walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.

KI2 17:20  And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted
 them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them
 out of his sight.

KI2 17:21  For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam
 the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and
 made them sin a great sin.

KI2 17:22  For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which
 he did; they departed not from them;

KI2 17:23  Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by
 all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own
 land to Assyria unto this day.

KI2 17:24  And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from
 Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them
 in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they
 possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.

KI2 17:25  And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they
 feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew
 some of them.

KI2 17:26  Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations
 which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the
 manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and,
 behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the
 land.

KI2 17:27  Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the
 priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let
 him teach them the manner of the God of the land.

KI2 17:28  Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came
 and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.

KI2 17:29  Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the
 houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation
 in their cities wherein they dwelt.

KI2 17:30  And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made
 Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,

KI2 17:31  And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt
 their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.

KI2 17:32  So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest
 of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses
 of the high places.

KI2 17:33  They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner
 of the nations whom they carried away from thence.

KI2 17:34  Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the
 LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or
 after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob,
 whom he named Israel;

KI2 17:35  With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye
 shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor
 sacrifice to them:

KI2 17:36  But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great
 power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye
 worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.

KI2 17:37  And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
 commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and
 ye shall not fear other gods.

KI2 17:38  And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget;
 neither shall ye fear other gods.

KI2 17:39  But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out
 of the hand of all your enemies.

KI2 17:40  Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
 manner.

KI2 17:41  So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images,
 both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so
 do they unto this day.

KI2 18:1  Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of
 Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.

KI2 18:2  Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he
 reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
 Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.

KI2 18:3  And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according
 to all that David his father did.

KI2 18:4  He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the
 groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto
 those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it
 Nehushtan.

KI2 18:5  He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like
 him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.

KI2 18:6  For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but
 kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.

KI2 18:7  And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went
 forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.

KI2 18:8  He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof,
 from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

KI2 18:9  And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was
 the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king
 of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.

KI2 18:10  And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year
 of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was
 taken.

KI2 18:11  And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put
 them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
 Medes:

KI2 18:12  Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but
 transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD
 commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.

KI2 18:13  Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of
 Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.

KI2 18:14  And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish,
 saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I
 bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three
 hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.

KI2 18:15  And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house
 of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.

KI2 18:16  At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the
 temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had
 overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.

KI2 18:17  And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from
 Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went
 up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by
 the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.

KI2 18:18  And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim
 the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and
 Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.

KI2 18:19  And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith
 the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou
 trustest?

KI2 18:20  Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and
 strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest
 against me?

KI2 18:21  Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even
 upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it:
 so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.

KI2 18:22  But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he,
 whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to
 Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?

KI2 18:23  Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of
 Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy
 part to set riders upon them.

KI2 18:24  How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of
 my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for
 horsemen?

KI2 18:25  Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it?
 The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.

KI2 18:26  Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto
 Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we
 understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the
 people that are on the wall.

KI2 18:27  But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
 master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men
 which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own
 piss with you?

KI2 18:28  Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
 language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of
 Assyria:

KI2 18:29  Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not
 be able to deliver you out of his hand:

KI2 18:30  Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD
 will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand
 of the king of Assyria.

KI2 18:31  Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an
 agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man
 of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the
 waters of his cistern:

KI2 18:32  Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land
 of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of
 honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he
 persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.

KI2 18:33  Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out
 of the hand of the king of Assyria?

KI2 18:34  Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of
 Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?

KI2 18:35  Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have
 delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver
 Jerusalem out of mine hand?

KI2 18:36  But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for
 the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

KI2 18:37  Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
 household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to
 Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

KI2 19:1  And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his
 clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the
 LORD.

KI2 19:2  And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the
 scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the
 prophet the son of Amoz.

KI2 19:3  And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of
 trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to the
 birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

KI2 19:4  It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom
 the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will
 reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy
 prayer for the remnant that are left.

KI2 19:5  So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

KI2 19:6  And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus
 saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which
 the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

KI2 19:7  Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and
 shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in
 his own land.

KI2 19:8  So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against
 Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.

KI2 19:9  And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is
 come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah,
 saying,

KI2 19:10  Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy
 God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be
 delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

KI2 19:11  Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all
 lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?

KI2 19:12  Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have
 destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which
 were in Thelasar?

KI2 19:13  Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king
 of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?

KI2 19:14  And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and
 read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it
 before the LORD.

KI2 19:15  And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel,
 which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of
 all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.

KI2 19:16  LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see:
 and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living
 God.

KI2 19:17  Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations
 and their lands,

KI2 19:18  And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but
 the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.

KI2 19:19  Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of
 his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD
 God, even thou only.

KI2 19:20  Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the
 LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib
 king of Assyria I have heard.

KI2 19:21  This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
 virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn;
 the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

KI2 19:22  Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou
 exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy
 One of Israel.

KI2 19:23  By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said, With
 the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains,
 to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and
 the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his
 borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.

KI2 19:24  I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet
 have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.

KI2 19:25  Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient
 times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou
 shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.

KI2 19:26  Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed
 and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb,
 as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.

KI2 19:27  But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy
 rage against me.

KI2 19:28  Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine
 ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips,
 and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.

KI2 19:29  And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such
 things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth
 of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and
 eat the fruits thereof.

KI2 19:30  And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet
 again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

KI2 19:31  For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape
 out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.

KI2 19:32  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He
 shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it
 with shield, nor cast a bank against it.

KI2 19:33  By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not
 come into this city, saith the LORD.

KI2 19:34  For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for
 my servant David's sake.

KI2 19:35  And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went
 out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five
 thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all
 dead corpses.

KI2 19:36  So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and
 dwelt at Nineveh.

KI2 19:37  And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch
 his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and
 they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his
 stead.

KI2 20:1  In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah
 the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set
 thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.

KI2 20:2  Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
 saying,

KI2 20:3  I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in
 truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy
 sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

KI2 20:4  And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court,
 that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,

KI2 20:5  Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith
 the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen
 thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto
 the house of the LORD.

KI2 20:6  And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee
 and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this
 city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.

KI2 20:7  And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on
 the boil, and he recovered.

KI2 20:8  And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD
 will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third
 day?

KI2 20:9  And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD
 will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten
 degrees, or go back ten degrees?

KI2 20:10  And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down
 ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.

KI2 20:11  And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the
 shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.

KI2 20:12  At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon,
 sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had
 been sick.

KI2 20:13  And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of
 his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the
 precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in
 his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that
 Hezekiah shewed them not.

KI2 20:14  Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him,
 What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said,
 They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.

KI2 20:15  And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
 answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is
 nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.

KI2 20:16  And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.

KI2 20:17  Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that
 which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into
 Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.

KI2 20:18  And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget,
 shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of
 Babylon.

KI2 20:19  Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which
 thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my
 days?

KI2 20:20  And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he
 made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI2 20:21  And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in
 his stead.

KI2 21:1  Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned
 fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah.

KI2 21:2  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the
 abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of
 Israel.

KI2 21:3  For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
 destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab
 king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.

KI2 21:4  And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said,
 In Jerusalem will I put my name.

KI2 21:5  And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
 of the house of the LORD.

KI2 21:6  And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and
 used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought
 much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

KI2 21:7  And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house,
 of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and
 in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my
 name for ever:

KI2 21:8  Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land
 which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all
 that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant
 Moses commanded them.

KI2 21:9  But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil
 than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.

KI2 21:10  And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,

KI2 21:11  Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and
 hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before
 him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:

KI2 21:12  Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing
 such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his
 ears shall tingle.

KI2 21:13  And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
 plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a
 dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.

KI2 21:14  And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them
 into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to
 all their enemies;

KI2 21:15  Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have
 provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt,
 even unto this day.

KI2 21:16  Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled
 Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to
 sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.

KI2 21:17  Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his
 sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
 kings of Judah?

KI2 21:18  And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of
 his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 21:19  Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the
 daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

KI2 21:20  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
 father Manasseh did.

KI2 21:21  And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served
 the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:

KI2 21:22  And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the
 way of the LORD.

KI2 21:23  And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in
 his own house.

KI2 21:24  And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against
 king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

KI2 21:25  Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written
 in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI2 21:26  And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah
 his son reigned in his stead.

KI2 22:1  Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
 thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah, the
 daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.

KI2 22:2  And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked
 in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or
 to the left.

KI2 22:3  And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the
 king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe,
 to the house of the LORD, saying,

KI2 22:4  Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is
 brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have
 gathered of the people:

KI2 22:5  And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that
 have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the
 doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches
 of the house,

KI2 22:6  Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn
 stone to repair the house.

KI2 22:7  Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was
 delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.

KI2 22:8  And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have
 found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book
 to Shaphan, and he read it.

KI2 22:9  And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word
 again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the
 house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that
 have the oversight of the house of the LORD.

KI2 22:10  And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest
 hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.

KI2 22:11  And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book
 of the law, that he rent his clothes.

KI2 22:12  And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of
 Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah
 a servant of the king's, saying,

KI2 22:13  Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all
 Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the
 wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not
 hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is
 written concerning us.

KI2 22:14  So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and
 Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of
 Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
 Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.

KI2 22:15  And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the
 man that sent you to me,

KI2 22:16  Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and
 upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king
 of Judah hath read:

KI2 22:17  Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other
 gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands;
 therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be
 quenched.

KI2 22:18  But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus
 shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words
 which thou hast heard;

KI2 22:19  Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before
 the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the
 inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and
 hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the
 LORD.

KI2 22:20  Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou
 shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all
 the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word
 again.

KI2 23:1  And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah
 and of Jerusalem.

KI2 23:2  And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of
 Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the
 prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears
 all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the
 LORD.

KI2 23:3  And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD,
 to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and
 his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of
 this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the
 covenant.

KI2 23:4  And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests
 of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the
 temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the
 grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem
 in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.

KI2 23:5  And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had
 ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and
 in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal,
 to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of
 heaven.

KI2 23:6  And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without
 Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and
 stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves
 of the children of the people.

KI2 23:7  And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house
 of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.

KI2 23:8  And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and
 defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to
 Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the
 entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a
 man's left hand at the gate of the city.

KI2 23:9  Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar
 of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among
 their brethren.

KI2 23:10  And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of
 Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the
 fire to Molech.

KI2 23:11  And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the
 sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of
 Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the
 chariots of the sun with fire.

KI2 23:12  And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz,
 which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made
 in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake
 them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.

KI2 23:13  And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the
 right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had
 builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the
 abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children
 of Ammon, did the king defile.

KI2 23:14  And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and
 filled their places with the bones of men.

KI2 23:15  Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which
 Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar
 and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it
 small to powder, and burned the grove.

KI2 23:16  And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were
 there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and
 burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the
 LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.

KI2 23:17  Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city
 told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and
 proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.

KI2 23:18  And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let
 his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.

KI2 23:19  And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities
 of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger,
 Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done
 in Bethel.

KI2 23:20  And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon
 the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.

KI2 23:21  And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover
 unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.

KI2 23:22  Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the
 judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor
 of the kings of Judah;

KI2 23:23  But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was
 holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.

KI2 23:24  Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the
 images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land
 of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the
 words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found
 in the house of the LORD.

KI2 23:25  And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the
 LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might,
 according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like
 him.

KI2 23:26  Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great
 wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the
 provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.

KI2 23:27  And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I
 have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have
 chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.

KI2 23:28  Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they
 not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI2 23:29  In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of
 Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew
 him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

KI2 23:30  And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and
 brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people
 of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him
 king in his father's stead.

KI2 23:31  Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and
 he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the
 daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

KI2 23:32  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according
 to all that his fathers had done.

KI2 23:33  And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath,
 that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an
 hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.

KI2 23:34  And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of
 Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away:
 and he came to Egypt, and died there.

KI2 23:35  And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed
 the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he
 exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one
 according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.

KI2 23:36  Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and
 he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the
 daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

KI2 23:37  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according
 to all that his fathers had done.

KI2 24:1  In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim
 became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.

KI2 24:2  And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the
 Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and
 sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD,
 which he spake by his servants the prophets.

KI2 24:3  Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove
 them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he
 did;

KI2 24:4  And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem
 with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.

KI2 24:5  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they
 not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

KI2 24:6  So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned
 in his stead.

KI2 24:7  And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for
 the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river
 Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.

KI2 24:8  Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the
 daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

KI2 24:9  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to
 all that his father had done.

KI2 24:10  At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up
 against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.

KI2 24:11  And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his
 servants did besiege it.

KI2 24:12  And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon,
 he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and
 the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.

KI2 24:13  And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the
 LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the
 vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the
 LORD, as the LORD had said.

KI2 24:14  And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the
 mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and
 smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.

KI2 24:15  And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's
 mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land,
 those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.

KI2 24:16  And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and
 smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king
 of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.

KI2 24:17  And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in
 his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.

KI2 24:18  Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the
 daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

KI2 24:19  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according
 to all that Jehoiakim had done.

KI2 24:20  For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and
 Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled
 against the king of Babylon.

KI2 25:1  And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
 month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
 came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and
 they built forts against it round about.

KI2 25:2  And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.

KI2 25:3  And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the
 city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.

KI2 25:4  And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by
 the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now
 the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way
 toward the plain.

KI2 25:5  And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him
 in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.

KI2 25:6  So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to
 Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.

KI2 25:7  And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the
 eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to
 Babylon.

KI2 25:8  And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the
 nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan,
 captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:

KI2 25:9  And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the
 houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire.

KI2 25:10  And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the
 guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.

KI2 25:11  Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
 fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the
 multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.

KI2 25:12  But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the
 land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.

KI2 25:13  And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the
 bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees
 break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.

KI2 25:14  And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and
 all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.

KI2 25:15  And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in
 gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.

KI2 25:16  The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for
 the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.

KI2 25:17  The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter
 upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the
 wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass:
 and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.

KI2 25:18  And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
 Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:

KI2 25:19  And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of
 war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found
 in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people
 of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found
 in the city:

KI2 25:20  And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them
 to the king of Babylon to Riblah:

KI2 25:21  And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the
 land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.

KI2 25:22  And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the
 son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.

KI2 25:23  And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard
 that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah
 to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of
 Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the
 son of a Maachathite, they and their men.

KI2 25:24  And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them,
 Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the
 king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.

KI2 25:25  But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of
 Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with
 him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that
 were with him at Mizpah.

KI2 25:26  And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the
 armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.

KI2 25:27  And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity
 of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth
 day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began
 to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;

KI2 25:28  And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne
 of the kings that were with him in Babylon;

KI2 25:29  And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually
 before him all the days of his life.

KI2 25:30  And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a
 daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

NEH 1:1  The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the
 month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,

NEH 1:2  That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah;
 and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the
 captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

NEH 1:3  And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity
 there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of
 Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

NEH 1:4  And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and
 wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of
 heaven,

NEH 1:5  And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible
 God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his
 commandments:

NEH 1:6  Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest
 hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night,
 for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children
 of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house
 have sinned.

NEH 1:7  We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the
 commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy
 servant Moses.

NEH 1:8  Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant
 Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:

NEH 1:9  But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though
 there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I
 gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have
 chosen to set my name there.

NEH 1:10  Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by
 thy great power, and by thy strong hand.

NEH 1:11  O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer
 of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy
 name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy
 in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.

NEH 2:1  And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of
 Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and
 gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.

NEH 2:2  Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing
 thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very
 sore afraid,

NEH 2:3  And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my
 countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth
 waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?

NEH 2:4  Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I
 prayed to the God of heaven.

NEH 2:5  And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant
 have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto
 the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.

NEH 2:6  And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how
 long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king
 to send me; and I set him a time.

NEH 2:7  Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be
 given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till
 I come into Judah;

NEH 2:8  And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may
 give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained
 to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall
 enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God
 upon me.

NEH 2:9  Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the
 king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with
 me.

NEH 2:10  When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite,
 heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek
 the welfare of the children of Israel.

NEH 2:11  So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.

NEH 2:12  And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I
 any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there
 any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.

NEH 2:13  And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the
 dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which
 were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.

NEH 2:14  Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool:
 but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.

NEH 2:15  Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and
 turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.

NEH 2:16  And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I
 as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the
 rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.

NEH 2:17  Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
 Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and
 let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.

NEH 2:18  Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as
 also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise
 up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.

NEH 2:19  But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
 Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and
 despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against
 the king?

NEH 2:20  Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will
 prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no
 portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

NEH 3:1  Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests,
 and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of
 it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of
 Hananeel.

NEH 3:2  And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded
 Zaccur the son of Imri.

NEH 3:3  But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the
 beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars
 thereof.

NEH 3:4  And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of
 Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of
 Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.

NEH 3:5  And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not
 their necks to the work of their LORD.

NEH 3:6  Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and
 Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the
 doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

NEH 3:7  And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the
 Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the
 governor on this side the river.

NEH 3:8  Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths.
 Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and
 they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall.

NEH 3:9  And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the
 half part of Jerusalem.

NEH 3:10  And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over
 against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah.

NEH 3:11  Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab,
 repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.

NEH 3:12  And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler
 of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.

NEH 3:13  The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they
 built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars
 thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate.

NEH 3:14  But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of
 part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks
 thereof, and the bars thereof.

NEH 3:15  But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of
 Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set
 up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall
 of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down
 from the city of David.

NEH 3:16  After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half
 part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and
 to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty.

NEH 3:17  After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him
 repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part.

NEH 3:18  After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the
 ruler of the half part of Keilah.

NEH 3:19  And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah,
 another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the
 wall.

NEH 3:20  After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other
 piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib
 the high priest.

NEH 3:21  After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another
 piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of
 Eliashib.

NEH 3:22  And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.

NEH 3:23  After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house.
 After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his
 house.

NEH 3:24  After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the
 house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the corner.

NEH 3:25  Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and the
 tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that was by the court
 of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh.

NEH 3:26  Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against
 the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out.

NEH 3:27  After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the
 great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.

NEH 3:28  From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over
 against his house.

NEH 3:29  After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house.
 After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the
 east gate.

NEH 3:30  After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth
 son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the son of
 Berechiah over against his chamber.

NEH 3:31  After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the
 Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the
 going up of the corner.

NEH 3:32  And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired
 the goldsmiths and the merchants.

NEH 4:1  But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the
 wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.

NEH 4:2  And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said,
 What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice?
 will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps
 of the rubbish which are burned?

NEH 4:3  Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they
 build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.

NEH 4:4  Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon
 their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:

NEH 4:5  And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out
 from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.

NEH 4:6  So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the
 half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.

NEH 4:7  But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
 Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of
 Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they
 were very wroth,

NEH 4:8  And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against
 Jerusalem, and to hinder it.

NEH 4:9  Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against
 them day and night, because of them.

NEH 4:10  And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
 decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the
 wall.

NEH 4:11  And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we
 come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.

NEH 4:12  And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
 came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return
 unto us they will be upon you.

NEH 4:13  Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the
 higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords,
 their spears, and their bows.

NEH 4:14  And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the
 rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the
 LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons,
 and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.

NEH 4:15  And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto
 us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us
 to the wall, every one unto his work.

NEH 4:16  And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
 servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the
 spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were
 behind all the house of Judah.

NEH 4:17  They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with
 those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and
 with the other hand held a weapon.

NEH 4:18  For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so
 builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.

NEH 4:19  And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the
 people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one
 far from another.

NEH 4:20  In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye
 thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.

NEH 4:21  So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the
 rising of the morning till the stars appeared.

NEH 4:22  Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with
 his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to
 us, and labour on the day.

NEH 4:23  So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the
 guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every
 one put them off for washing.

NEH 5:1  And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against
 their brethren the Jews.

NEH 5:2  For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many:
 therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.

NEH 5:3  Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
 vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.

NEH 5:4  There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's
 tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.

NEH 5:5  Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as
 their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to
 be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already:
 neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and
 vineyards.

NEH 5:6  And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.

NEH 5:7  Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the
 rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I
 set a great assembly against them.

NEH 5:8  And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren
 the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your
 brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and
 found nothing to answer.

NEH 5:9  Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the
 fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?

NEH 5:10  I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them
 money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

NEH 5:11  Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their
 vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the
 money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.

NEH 5:12  Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing
 of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an
 oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.

NEH 5:13  Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his
 house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he
 shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the
 LORD. And the people did according to this promise.

NEH 5:14  Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor
 in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth
 year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have
 not eaten the bread of the governor.

NEH 5:15  But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto
 the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of
 silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I,
 because of the fear of God.

NEH 5:16  Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any
 land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.

NEH 5:17  Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and
 rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about
 us.

NEH 5:18  Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice
 sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all
 sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor,
 because the bondage was heavy upon this people.

NEH 5:19  Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done
 for this people.

NEH 6:1  Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
 Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and
 that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up
 the doors upon the gates;)

NEH 6:2  That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet
 together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to
 do me mischief.

NEH 6:3  And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so
 that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and
 come down to you?

NEH 6:4  Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them
 after the same manner.

NEH 6:5  Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time
 with an open letter in his hand;

NEH 6:6  Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu
 saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou
 buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.

NEH 6:7  And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem,
 saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king
 according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel
 together.

NEH 6:8  Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou
 sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.

NEH 6:9  For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened
 from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my
 hands.

NEH 6:10  Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the
 son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the
 house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for
 they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.

NEH 6:11  And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that,
 being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.

NEH 6:12  And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
 pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.

NEH 6:13  Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and
 sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might
 reproach me.

NEH 6:14  My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their
 works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that
 would have put me in fear.

NEH 6:15  So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month
 Elul, in fifty and two days.

NEH 6:16  And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all
 the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down
 in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.

NEH 6:17  Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto
 Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.

NEH 6:18  For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son
 in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the
 daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.

NEH 6:19  Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to
 him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

NEH 7:1  Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the
 doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,

NEH 7:2  That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace,
 charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.

NEH 7:3  And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until
 the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar
 them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his
 watch, and every one to be over against his house.

NEH 7:4  Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and
 the houses were not builded.

NEH 7:5  And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the
 rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found
 a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found
 written therein,

NEH 7:6  These are the children of the province, that went up out of the
 captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king
 of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every
 one unto his city;

NEH 7:7  Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah,
 Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, I
 say, of the men of the people of Israel was this;

NEH 7:8  The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two.

NEH 7:9  The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.

NEH 7:10  The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.

 thousand and eight hundred and eighteen.

NEH 7:12  The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.

NEH 7:13  The children of Zattu, eight hundred forty and five.

NEH 7:14  The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore.

NEH 7:15  The children of Binnui, six hundred forty and eight.

NEH 7:27  The men of Anathoth, an hundred twenty and eight.

NEH 7:28  The men of Bethazmaveth, forty and two.

NEH 7:29  The men of Kirjathjearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred forty
 and three.

NEH 7:30  The men of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty and one.

NEH 7:31  The men of Michmas, an hundred and twenty and two.

NEH 7:32  The men of Bethel and Ai, an hundred twenty and three.

NEH 7:33  The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two.

NEH 7:34  The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and
 four.

NEH 7:35  The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.

NEH 7:36  The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.

NEH 7:37  The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one.

NEH 7:38  The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.

NEH 7:39  The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine
 hundred seventy and three.

NEH 7:40  The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.

NEH 7:41  The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven.

NEH 7:42  The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.

NEH 7:43  The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the children
 of Hodevah, seventy and four.

NEH 7:44  The singers: the children of Asaph, an hundred forty and eight.

NEH 7:45  The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the
 children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the
 children of Shobai, an hundred thirty and eight.

NEH 7:46  The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha, the
 children of Tabbaoth,

NEH 7:47  The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon,

NEH 7:48  The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of
 Shalmai,

NEH 7:49  The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar,

NEH 7:50  The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of
 Nekoda,

NEH 7:51  The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of
 Phaseah,

NEH 7:52  The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of
 Nephishesim,

NEH 7:53  The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of
 Harhur,

NEH 7:54  The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of
 Harsha,

NEH 7:55  The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of
 Tamah,

NEH 7:56  The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

NEH 7:57  The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the
 children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,

NEH 7:58  The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of
 Giddel,

NEH 7:59  The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of
 Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.

NEH 7:60  All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three
 hundred ninety and two.

NEH 7:61  And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha,
 Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, nor
 their seed, whether they were of Israel.

NEH 7:62  The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of
 Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.

NEH 7:63  And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the
 children of Barzillai, which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the
 Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.

NEH 7:64  These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
 genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from
 the priesthood.

NEH 7:65  And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the
 most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.

NEH 7:66  The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
 hundred and threescore,

NEH 7:67  Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were
 seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty
 and five singing men and singing women.

NEH 7:68  Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred
 forty and five:

NEH 7:69  Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven
 hundred and twenty asses.

NEH 7:70  And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The
 Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five
 hundred and thirty priests' garments.

NEH 7:71  And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work
 twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of
 silver.

NEH 7:72  And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams
 of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests'
 garments.

NEH 7:73  So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers,
 and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their
 cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their
 cities.

NEH 8:1  And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the
 street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to
 bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.

NEH 8:2  And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of
 men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day
 of the seventh month.

NEH 8:3  And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate
 from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that
 could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book
 of the law.

NEH 8:4  And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made
 for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and
 Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand,
 Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana,
 Zechariah, and Meshullam.

NEH 8:5  And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was
 above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:

NEH 8:6  And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered,
 Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and
 worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.

NEH 8:7  Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai,
 Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites,
 caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.

NEH 8:8  So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the
 sense, and caused them to understand the reading.

NEH 8:9  And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
 scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people,
 This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the
 people wept, when they heard the words of the law.

NEH 8:10  Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the
 sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day
 is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your
 strength.

NEH 8:11  So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for
 the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.

NEH 8:12  And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send
 portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that
 were declared unto them.

NEH 8:13  And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers
 of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even
 to understand the words of the law.

NEH 8:14  And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by
 Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the
 seventh month:

NEH 8:15  And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in
 Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and
 pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick
 trees, to make booths, as it is written.

NEH 8:16  So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves
 booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the
 courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the
 street of the gate of Ephraim.

NEH 8:17  And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the
 captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua
 the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And
 there was very great gladness.

NEH 8:18  Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the
 book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth
 day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.

NEH 9:1  Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel
 were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.

NEH 9:2  And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and
 stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.

NEH 9:3  And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law
 of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part
 they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.

NEH 9:4  Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani,
 Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a
 loud voice unto the LORD their God.

NEH 9:5  Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah,
 Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God
 for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above
 all blessing and praise.

NEH 9:6  Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of
 heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the
 seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of
 heaven worshippeth thee.

NEH 9:7  Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him
 forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;

NEH 9:8  And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant
 with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and
 the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to
 his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:

NEH 9:9  And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest
 their cry by the Red sea;

NEH 9:10  And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his
 servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt
 proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.

NEH 9:11  And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through
 the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest
 into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.

NEH 9:12  Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the
 night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should
 go.

NEH 9:13  Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from
 heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and
 commandments:

NEH 9:14  And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them
 precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:

NEH 9:15  And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest
 forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them
 that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give
 them.

NEH 9:16  But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and
 hearkened not to thy commandments,

NEH 9:17  And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou
 didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed
 a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon,
 gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest
 them not.

NEH 9:18  Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God
 that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;

NEH 9:19  Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the
 wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead
 them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and
 the way wherein they should go.

NEH 9:20  Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest
 not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.

NEH 9:21  Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that
 they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.

NEH 9:22  Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them
 into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king
 of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.

NEH 9:23  Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and
 broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their
 fathers, that they should go in to possess it.

NEH 9:24  So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst
 before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into
 their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do
 with them as they would.

NEH 9:25  And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses
 full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees
 in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted
 themselves in thy great goodness.

NEH 9:26  Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and
 cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified
 against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.

NEH 9:27  Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who
 vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou
 heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest
 them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.

NEH 9:28  But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore
 leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion
 over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them
 from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;

NEH 9:29  And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again
 unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy
 commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall
 live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would
 not hear.

NEH 9:30  Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them
 by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest
 thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.

NEH 9:31  Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly
 consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.

NEH 9:32  Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God,
 who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before
 thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our
 priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people,
 since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.

NEH 9:33  Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast
 done right, but we have done wickedly:

NEH 9:34  Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers,
 kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies,
 wherewith thou didst testify against them.

NEH 9:35  For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great
 goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou
 gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.

NEH 9:36  Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest
 unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we
 are servants in it:

NEH 9:37  And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over
 us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our
 cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.

NEH 9:38  And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and
 our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.

NEH 10:1  Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of
 Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,

NEH 10:2  Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

NEH 10:3  Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,

NEH 10:4  Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,

NEH 10:5  Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,

NEH 10:6  Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,

NEH 10:7  Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,

NEH 10:8  Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.

NEH 10:9  And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons
 of Henadad, Kadmiel;

NEH 10:10  And their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,

NEH 10:11  Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,

NEH 10:12  Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,

NEH 10:13  Hodijah, Bani, Beninu.

NEH 10:14  The chief of the people; Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu, Bani,

NEH 10:15  Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,

NEH 10:16  Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,

NEH 10:17  Ater, Hizkijah, Azzur,

NEH 10:18  Hodijah, Hashum, Bezai,

NEH 10:19  Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,

NEH 10:20  Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,

NEH 10:21  Meshezabeel, Zadok, Jaddua,

NEH 10:22  Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,

NEH 10:23  Hoshea, Hananiah, Hashub,

NEH 10:24  Hallohesh, Pileha, Shobek,

NEH 10:25  Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,

NEH 10:26  And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,

NEH 10:27  Malluch, Harim, Baanah.

NEH 10:28  And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters,
 the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had separated themselves from
 the people of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and
 their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding;

NEH 10:29  They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a
 curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the
 servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our
 Lord, and his judgments and his statutes;

NEH 10:30  And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the
 land, not take their daughters for our sons:

NEH 10:31  And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the
 sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on
 the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of
 every debt.

NEH 10:32  Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the
 third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;

NEH 10:33  For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the
 continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set
 feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make an
 atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.

NEH 10:34  And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people,
 for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the
 houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the
 altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law:

NEH 10:35  And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of
 all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the LORD:

NEH 10:36  Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written
 in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring
 to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our
 God:

NEH 10:37  And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our
 offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the
 priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our
 ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all
 the cities of our tillage.

NEH 10:38  And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the
 Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes
 unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house.

NEH 10:39  For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the
 offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where
 are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the
 porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.

NEH 11:1  And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the
 people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy
 city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities.

NEH 11:2  And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered themselves
 to dwell at Jerusalem.

NEH 11:3  Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but
 in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, to
 wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the
 children of Solomon's servants.

NEH 11:4  And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the
 children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah the son of
 Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the
 son of Mahalaleel, of the children of Perez;

NEH 11:5  And Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son of
 Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son
 of Shiloni.

NEH 11:6  All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred
 threescore and eight valiant men.

NEH 11:7  And these are the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the
 son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the
 son of Ithiel, the son of Jesaiah.

NEH 11:8  And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.

NEH 11:9  And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the son of
 Senuah was second over the city.

NEH 11:10  Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.

NEH 11:11  Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of
 Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler of the house of
 God.

NEH 11:12  And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred
 twenty and two: and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son
 of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchiah.

NEH 11:13  And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and two:
 and Amashai the son of Azareel, the son of Ahasai, the son of
 Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,

NEH 11:14  And their brethren, mighty men of valour, an hundred twenty and
 eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of one of the great men.

NEH 11:15  Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of
 Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;

NEH 11:16  And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had the
 oversight of the outward business of the house of God.

NEH 11:17  And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph,
 was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer: and Bakbukiah the
 second among his brethren, and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the
 son of Jeduthun.

NEH 11:18  All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and
 four.

NEH 11:19  Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that kept
 the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.

NEH 11:20  And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites, were in
 all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.

NEH 11:21  But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over the
 Nethinims.

NEH 11:22  The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of
 Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha. Of the
 sons of Asaph, the singers were over the business of the house of God.

NEH 11:23  For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a certain
 portion should be for the singers, due for every day.

NEH 11:24  And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the
 son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people.

NEH 11:25  And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of
 Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and in the villages thereof, and at Dibon, and
 in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel, and in the villages thereof,

NEH 11:26  And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Bethphelet,

NEH 11:27  And at Hazarshual, and at Beersheba, and in the villages thereof,

NEH 11:28  And at Ziklag, and at Mekonah, and in the villages thereof,

NEH 11:29  And at Enrimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth,

NEH 11:30  Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish, and the fields
 thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And they dwelt from
 Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom.

NEH 11:31  The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and
 Aija, and Bethel, and in their villages.

NEH 11:32  And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

NEH 11:33  Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

NEH 11:34  Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

NEH 11:35  Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.

NEH 11:36  And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.

NEH 12:1  Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with
 Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,

NEH 12:2  Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

NEH 12:3  Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

NEH 12:4  Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,

NEH 12:5  Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

NEH 12:6  Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

NEH 12:7  Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chief of the priests
 and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.

NEH 12:8  Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and
 Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.

NEH 12:9  Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them
 in the watches.

NEH 12:10  And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib
 begat Joiada,

NEH 12:11  And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.

NEH 12:12  And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers:
 of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

NEH 12:13  Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

NEH 12:14  Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

NEH 12:15  Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;

NEH 12:16  Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

NEH 12:17  Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai:

NEH 12:18  Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

NEH 12:19  And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

NEH 12:20  Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

NEH 12:21  Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.

NEH 12:22  The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
 Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of
 Darius the Persian.

NEH 12:23  The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book
 of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.

NEH 12:24  And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the
 son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give
 thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over
 against ward.

NEH 12:25  Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were
 porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.

NEH 12:26  These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of
 Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the
 priest, the scribe.

NEH 12:27  And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
 Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the
 dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with
 cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.

NEH 12:28  And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out
 of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of
 Netophathi;

NEH 12:29  Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and
 Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.

NEH 12:30  And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified
 the people, and the gates, and the wall.

NEH 12:31  Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed
 two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right
 hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:

NEH 12:32  And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,

NEH 12:33  And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

NEH 12:34  Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,

NEH 12:35  And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah
 the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of
 Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:

NEH 12:36  And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai,
 Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man
 of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.

NEH 12:37  And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up
 by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the
 house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.

NEH 12:38  And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against
 them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond
 the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;

NEH 12:39  And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and
 above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even
 unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.

NEH 12:40  So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of
 God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:

NEH 12:41  And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai,
 Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;

NEH 12:42  And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and
 Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with
 Jezrahiah their overseer.

NEH 12:43  Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God
 had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children
 rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.

NEH 12:44  And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
 treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to
 gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for
 the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the
 Levites that waited.

NEH 12:45  And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and
 the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of
 Solomon his son.

NEH 12:46  For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the
 singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.

NEH 12:47  And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
 Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his
 portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites
 sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.

NEH 13:1  On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the
 people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite
 should not come into the congregation of God for ever;

NEH 13:2  Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with
 water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our
 God turned the curse into a blessing.

NEH 13:3  Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated
 from Israel all the mixed multitude.

NEH 13:4  And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the
 chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:

NEH 13:5  And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they
 laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes
 of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given
 to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the
 priests.

NEH 13:6  But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and
 thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after
 certain days obtained I leave of the king:

NEH 13:7  And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did
 for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.

NEH 13:8  And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household
 stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.

NEH 13:9  Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought
 I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the
 frankincense.

NEH 13:10  And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given
 them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one
 to his field.

NEH 13:11  Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God
 forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.

NEH 13:12  Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and
 the oil unto the treasuries.

NEH 13:13  And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and
 Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the
 son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and
 their office was to distribute unto their brethren.

NEH 13:14  Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good
 deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.

NEH 13:15  In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
 sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and
 figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the
 sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold
 victuals.

NEH 13:16  There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all
 manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in
 Jerusalem.

NEH 13:17  Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What
 evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?

NEH 13:18  Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil
 upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning
 the sabbath.

NEH 13:19  And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be
 dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and
 charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my
 servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the
 sabbath day.

NEH 13:20  So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
 Jerusalem once or twice.

NEH 13:21  Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye
 about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time
 forth came they no more on the sabbath.

NEH 13:22  And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and
 that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day.
 Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the
 greatness of thy mercy.

NEH 13:23  In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of
 Ammon, and of Moab:

NEH 13:24  And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not
 speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.

NEH 13:25  And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain
 of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye
 shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto
 your sons, or for yourselves.

NEH 13:26  Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many
 nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made
 him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to
 sin.

NEH 13:27  Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to
 transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?

NEH 13:28  And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest,
 was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.

NEH 13:29  Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the
 priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.

NEH 13:30  Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards
 of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;

NEH 13:31  And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the
 firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

SA2 1:1  Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned
 from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;

SA2 1:2  It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out
 of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so
 it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

SA2 1:3  And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto
 him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

SA2 1:4  And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.
 And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the
 people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

SA2 1:5  And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that
 Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

SA2 1:6  And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon
 mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and
 horsemen followed hard after him.

SA2 1:7  And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I
 answered, Here am I.

SA2 1:8  And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
 Amalekite.

SA2 1:9  He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for
 anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.

SA2 1:10  So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could
 not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his
 head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto
 my lord.

SA2 1:11  Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all
 the men that were with him:

SA2 1:12  And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for
 Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of
 Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.

SA2 1:13  And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And
 he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.

SA2 1:14  And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth
 thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?

SA2 1:15  And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall
 upon him. And he smote him that he died.

SA2 1:16  And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth
 hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.

SA2 1:17  And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan
 his son:

SA2 1:18  (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow:
 behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

SA2 1:19  The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the
 mighty fallen!

SA2 1:20  Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest
 the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the
 uncircumcised triumph.

SA2 1:21  Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be
 rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty
 is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed
 with oil.

SA2 1:22  From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of
 Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.

SA2 1:23  Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and
 in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they
 were stronger than lions.

SA2 1:24  Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet,
 with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.

SA2 1:25  How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,
 thou wast slain in thine high places.

SA2 1:26  I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast
 thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.

SA2 1:27  How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

SA2 2:1  And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD,
 saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto
 him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.

SA2 2:2  So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
 Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

SA2 2:3  And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his
 household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

SA2 2:4  And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the
 house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead
 were they that buried Saul.

SA2 2:5  And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto
 them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your
 lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.

SA2 2:6  And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will
 requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.

SA2 2:7  Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for
 your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king
 over them.

SA2 2:8  But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the
 son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;

SA2 2:9  And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over
 Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.

SA2 2:10  Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over
 Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.

SA2 2:11  And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah
 was seven years and six months.

SA2 2:12  And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of
 Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

SA2 2:13  And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and
 met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one
 side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.

SA2 2:14  And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before
 us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

SA2 2:15  Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which
 pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.

SA2 2:16  And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his
 sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place
 was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.

SA2 2:17  And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and
 the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

SA2 2:18  And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and
 Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

SA2 2:19  And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the
 right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

SA2 2:20  Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he
 answered, I am.

SA2 2:21  And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy
 left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour.
 But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.

SA2 2:22  And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me:
 wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my
 face to Joab thy brother?

SA2 2:23  Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end
 of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind
 him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass,
 that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood
 still.

SA2 2:24  Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when
 they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the
 wilderness of Gibeon.

SA2 2:25  And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after
 Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.

SA2 2:26  Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever?
 knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall
 it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?

SA2 2:27  And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then
 in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.

SA2 2:28  So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued
 after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

SA2 2:29  And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and
 passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.

SA2 2:30  And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all
 the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and
 Asahel.

SA2 2:31  But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's
 men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

SA2 2:32  And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his
 father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they
 came to Hebron at break of day.

SA2 3:1  Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of
 David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed
 weaker and weaker.

SA2 3:2  And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon,
 of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

SA2 3:3  And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
 and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of
 Geshur;

SA2 3:4  And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah
 the son of Abital;

SA2 3:5  And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to
 David in Hebron.

SA2 3:6  And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and
 the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.

SA2 3:7  And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah:
 and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's
 concubine?

SA2 3:8  Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I
 a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of
 Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered
 thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault
 concerning this woman?

SA2 3:9  So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to
 David, even so I do to him;

SA2 3:10  To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the
 throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.

SA2 3:11  And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.

SA2 3:12  And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is
 the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be
 with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.

SA2 3:13  And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I
 require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring
 Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.

SA2 3:14  And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver
 me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the
 Philistines.

SA2 3:15  And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
 Phaltiel the son of Laish.

SA2 3:16  And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim.
 Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.

SA2 3:17  And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye
 sought for David in times past to be king over you:

SA2 3:18  Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the
 hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the
 Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.

SA2 3:19  And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to
 speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that
 seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.

SA2 3:20  So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David
 made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

SA2 3:21  And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all
 Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that
 thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner
 away; and he went in peace.

SA2 3:22  And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a
 troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David
 in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.

SA2 3:23  When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told
 Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him
 away, and he is gone in peace.

SA2 3:24  Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold,
 Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite
 gone?

SA2 3:25  Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and
 to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.

SA2 3:26  And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after
 Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.

SA2 3:27  And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the
 gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that
 he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.

SA2 3:28  And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are
 guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:

SA2 3:29  Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and
 let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is
 a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that
 lacketh bread.

SA2 3:30  So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain
 their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

SA2 3:31  And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him,
 Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And
 king David himself followed the bier.

SA2 3:32  And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
 voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.

SA2 3:33  And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool
 dieth?

SA2 3:34  Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man
 falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again
 over him.

SA2 3:35  And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was
 yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste
 bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

SA2 3:36  And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
 whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

SA2 3:37  For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not
 of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

SA2 3:38  And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a
 prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?

SA2 3:39  And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons
 of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil
 according to his wickedness.

SA2 4:1  And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands
 were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

SA2 4:2  And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name
 of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a
 Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to
 Benjamin.

SA2 4:3  And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until
 this day.)

SA2 4:4  And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was
 five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and
 his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to
 flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

SA2 4:5  And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and
 came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed
 at noon.

SA2 4:6  And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they
 would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab
 and Baanah his brother escaped.

SA2 4:7  For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
 bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his
 head, and gat them away through the plain all night.

SA2 4:8  And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said
 to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which
 sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of
 Saul, and of his seed.

SA2 4:9  And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon
 the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my
 soul out of all adversity,

SA2 4:10  When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have
 brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought
 that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:

SA2 4:11  How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his
 own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your
 hand, and take you away from the earth?

SA2 4:12  And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off
 their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But
 they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in
 Hebron.

SA2 5:1  Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake,
 saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

SA2 5:2  Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that
 leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt
 feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.

SA2 5:3  So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David
 made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David
 king over Israel.

SA2 5:4  David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
 forty years.

SA2 5:5  In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in
 Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.

SA2 5:6  And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
 inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take
 away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David
 cannot come in hither.

SA2 5:7  Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city
 of David.

SA2 5:8  And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and
 smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's
 soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the
 lame shall not come into the house.

SA2 5:9  So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David
 built round about from Millo and inward.

SA2 5:10  And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with
 him.

SA2 5:11  And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and
 carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.

SA2 5:12  And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over
 Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.

SA2 5:13  And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after
 he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.

SA2 5:14  And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem;
 Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

SA2 5:15  Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

SA2 5:16  And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

SA2 5:17  But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over
 Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and
 went down to the hold.

SA2 5:18  The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
 Rephaim.

SA2 5:19  And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
 Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto
 David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

SA2 5:20  And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said,
 The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of
 waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.

SA2 5:21  And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.

SA2 5:22  And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the
 valley of Rephaim.

SA2 5:23  And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up;
 but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry
 trees.

SA2 5:24  And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops
 of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall
 the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.

SA2 5:25  And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
 Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

SA2 6:1  Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty
 thousand.

SA2 6:2  And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from
 Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called
 by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.

SA2 6:3  And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the
 house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of
 Abinadab, drave the new cart.

SA2 6:4  And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah,
 accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.

SA2 6:5  And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all
 manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and
 on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.

SA2 6:6  And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his
 hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.

SA2 6:7  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him
 there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.

SA2 6:8  And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon
 Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.

SA2 6:9  And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark
 of the LORD come to me?

SA2 6:10  So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city
 of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

SA2 6:11  And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
 Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.

SA2 6:12  And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house
 of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So
 David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the
 city of David with gladness.

SA2 6:13  And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone
 six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

SA2 6:14  And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was
 girded with a linen ephod.

SA2 6:15  So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD
 with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

SA2 6:16  And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's
 daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing
 before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.

SA2 6:17  And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place,
 in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David
 offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

SA2 6:18  And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and
 peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.

SA2 6:19  And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of
 Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good
 piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to
 his house.

SA2 6:20  Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter
 of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel
 to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his
 servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!

SA2 6:21  And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me
 before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the
 people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.

SA2 6:22  And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own
 sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be
 had in honour.

SA2 6:23  Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of
 her death.

SA2 7:1  And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had
 given him rest round about from all his enemies;

SA2 7:2  That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an
 house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.

SA2 7:3  And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for
 the LORD is with thee.

SA2 7:4  And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto
 Nathan, saying,

SA2 7:5  Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me
 an house for me to dwell in?

SA2 7:6  Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up
 the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a
 tent and in a tabernacle.

SA2 7:7  In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of
 Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to
 feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?

SA2 7:8  Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the
 LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to
 be ruler over my people, over Israel:

SA2 7:9  And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all
 thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto
 the name of the great men that are in the earth.

SA2 7:10  Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant
 them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither
 shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,

SA2 7:11  And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people
 Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD
 telleth thee that he will make thee an house.

SA2 7:12  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
 fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy
 bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

SA2 7:13  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne
 of his kingdom for ever.

SA2 7:14  I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity,
 I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children
 of men:

SA2 7:15  But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul,
 whom I put away before thee.

SA2 7:16  And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before
 thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

SA2 7:17  According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so
 did Nathan speak unto David.

SA2 7:18  Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am
 I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?

SA2 7:19  And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou
 hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is
 this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

SA2 7:20  And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest
 thy servant.

SA2 7:21  For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done
 all these great things, to make thy servant know them.

SA2 7:22  Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee,
 neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard
 with our ears.

SA2 7:23  And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
 Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a
 name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy
 people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their
 gods?

SA2 7:24  For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people
 unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.

SA2 7:25  And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy
 servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast
 said.

SA2 7:26  And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is
 the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established
 before thee.

SA2 7:27  For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
 servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found
 in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

SA2 7:28  And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and
 thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

SA2 7:29  Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant,
 that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken
 it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

SA2 8:1  And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and
 subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.

SA2 8:2  And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down
 to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one
 full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and
 brought gifts.

SA2 8:3  David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he
 went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

SA2 8:4  And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
 horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot
 horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.

SA2 8:5  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of
 Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

SA2 8:6  Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became
 servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David
 whithersoever he went.

SA2 8:7  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
 Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

SA2 8:8  And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David
 took exceeding much brass.

SA2 8:9  When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of
 Hadadezer,

SA2 8:10  Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to
 bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for
 Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of
 silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:

SA2 8:11  Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and
 gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;

SA2 8:12  Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the
 Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king
 of Zobah.

SA2 8:13  And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians
 in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

SA2 8:14  And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons,
 and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David
 whithersoever he went.

SA2 8:15  And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and
 justice unto all his people.

SA2 8:16  And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the
 son of Ahilud was recorder;

SA2 8:17  And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were
 the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

SA2 8:18  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the
 Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

SA2 9:1  And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul,
 that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

SA2 9:2  And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And
 when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?
 And he said, Thy servant is he.

SA2 9:3  And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I
 may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan
 hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.

SA2 9:4  And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king,
 Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.

SA2 9:5  Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the
 son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

SA2 9:6  Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come
 unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said,
 Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!

SA2 9:7  And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee
 kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land
 of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.

SA2 9:8  And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
 shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?

SA2 9:9  Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I
 have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his
 house.

SA2 9:10  Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land
 for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have
 food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my
 table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

SA2 9:11  Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king
 hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth,
 said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.

SA2 9:12  And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that
 dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.

SA2 9:13  So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the
 king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

SA2 10:1  And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of
 Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

SA2 10:2  Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash,
 as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the
 hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land
 of the children of Ammon.

SA2 10:3  And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord,
 Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters
 unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the
 city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?

SA2 10:4  Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half
 of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their
 buttocks, and sent them away.

SA2 10:5  When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men
 were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards
 be grown, and then return.

SA2 10:6  And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the
 children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of
 Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of
 Ishtob twelve thousand men.

SA2 10:7  And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
 mighty men.

SA2 10:8  And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at
 the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and
 Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.

SA2 10:9  When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and
 behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array
 against the Syrians:

SA2 10:10  And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his
 brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.

SA2 10:11  And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt
 help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will
 come and help thee.

SA2 10:12  Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for
 the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.

SA2 10:13  And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the
 battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

SA2 10:14  And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then
 fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned
 from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.

SA2 10:15  And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they
 gathered themselves together.

SA2 10:16  And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the
 river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of
 Hadarezer went before them.

SA2 10:17  And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and
 passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in
 array against David, and fought with him.

SA2 10:18  And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven
 hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote
 Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.

SA2 10:19  And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they
 were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So
 the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.

SA2 11:1  And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when
 kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with
 him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged
 Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.

SA2 11:2  And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his
 bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a
 woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.

SA2 11:3  And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not
 this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?

SA2 11:4  And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
 him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she
 returned unto her house.

SA2 11:5  And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with
 child.

SA2 11:6  And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab
 sent Uriah to David.

SA2 11:7  And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab
 did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

SA2 11:8  And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And
 Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat
 from the king.

SA2 11:9  But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants
 of his lord, and went not down to his house.

SA2 11:10  And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his
 house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then
 didst thou not go down unto thine house?

SA2 11:11  And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in
 tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the
 open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie
 with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this
 thing.

SA2 11:12  And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I
 will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.

SA2 11:13  And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and
 he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the
 servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.

SA2 11:14  And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to
 Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

SA2 11:15  And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront
 of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and
 die.

SA2 11:16  And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned
 Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.

SA2 11:17  And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there
 fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died
 also.

SA2 11:18  Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;

SA2 11:19  And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of
 telling the matters of the war unto the king,

SA2 11:20  And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee,
 Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not
 that they would shoot from the wall?

SA2 11:21  Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a
 piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went
 ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

SA2 11:22  So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had
 sent him for.

SA2 11:23  And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against
 us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the
 entering of the gate.

SA2 11:24  And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some
 of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead
 also.

SA2 11:25  Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab,
 Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as
 another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and
 encourage thou him.

SA2 11:26  And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead,
 she mourned for her husband.

SA2 11:27  And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his
 house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David
 had done displeased the LORD.

SA2 12:1  And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said
 unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.

SA2 12:2  The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:

SA2 12:3  But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had
 bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his
 children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in
 his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.

SA2 12:4  And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take
 of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was
 come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that
 was come to him.

SA2 12:5  And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to
 Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely
 die:

SA2 12:6  And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
 thing, and because he had no pity.

SA2 12:7  And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God
 of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the
 hand of Saul;

SA2 12:8  And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy
 bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been
 too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.

SA2 12:9  Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil
 in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast
 taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the
 children of Ammon.

SA2 12:10  Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because
 thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy
 wife.

SA2 12:11  Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out
 of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give
 them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this
 sun.

SA2 12:12  For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all
 Israel, and before the sun.

SA2 12:13  And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And
 Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not
 die.

SA2 12:14  Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the
 enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall
 surely die.

SA2 12:15  And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child
 that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

SA2 12:16  David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and
 went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

SA2 12:17  And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up
 from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.

SA2 12:18  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the
 servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said,
 Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not
 hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
 child is dead?

SA2 12:19  But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that
 the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child
 dead? And they said, He is dead.

SA2 12:20  Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
 himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and
 worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set
 bread before him, and he did eat.

SA2 12:21  Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast
 done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when
 the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.

SA2 12:22  And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I
 said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may
 live?

SA2 12:23  But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back
 again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

SA2 12:24  And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and
 lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the
 LORD loved him.

SA2 12:25  And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his
 name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.

SA2 12:26  And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took
 the royal city.

SA2 12:27  And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against
 Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

SA2 12:28  Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp
 against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after
 my name.

SA2 12:29  And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and
 fought against it, and took it.

SA2 12:30  And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof
 was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's
 head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.

SA2 12:31  And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them
 under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them
 pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the
 children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

SA2 13:1  And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a
 fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.

SA2 13:2  And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for
 she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.

SA2 13:3  But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah
 David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

SA2 13:4  And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from
 day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my
 brother Absalom's sister.

SA2 13:5  And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself
 sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let
 my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that
 I may see it, and eat it at her hand.

SA2 13:6  So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come
 to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister
 come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.

SA2 13:7  Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's
 house, and dress him meat.

SA2 13:8  So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And
 she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the
 cakes.

SA2 13:9  And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to
 eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man
 from him.

SA2 13:10  And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I
 may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and
 brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.

SA2 13:11  And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
 her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

SA2 13:12  And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such
 thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

SA2 13:13  And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou
 shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak
 unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.

SA2 13:14  Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger
 than she, forced her, and lay with her.

SA2 13:15  Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he
 hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon
 said unto her, Arise, be gone.

SA2 13:16  And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me
 away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not
 hearken unto her.

SA2 13:17  Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put
 now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

SA2 13:18  And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such
 robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his
 servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.

SA2 13:19  And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers
 colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.

SA2 13:20  And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been
 with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not
 this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.

SA2 13:21  But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.

SA2 13:22  And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for
 Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.

SA2 13:23  And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
 sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all
 the king's sons.

SA2 13:24  And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath
 sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy
 servant.

SA2 13:25  And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go,
 lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go,
 but blessed him.

SA2 13:26  Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with
 us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?

SA2 13:27  But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons
 go with him.

SA2 13:28  Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when
 Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then
 kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.

SA2 13:29  And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded.
 Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and
 fled.

SA2 13:30  And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came
 to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not
 one of them left.

SA2 13:31  Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth;
 and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

SA2 13:32  And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said,
 Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's
 sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath
 been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.

SA2 13:33  Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart,
 to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.

SA2 13:34  But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up
 his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the
 hill side behind him.

SA2 13:35  And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy
 servant said, so it is.

SA2 13:36  And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking,
 that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and
 the king also and all his servants wept very sore.

SA2 13:37  But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of
 Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

SA2 13:38  So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

SA2 13:39  And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he
 was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

SA2 14:1  Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was
 toward Absalom.

SA2 14:2  And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said
 unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning
 apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long
 time mourned for the dead:

SA2 14:3  And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put
 the words in her mouth.

SA2 14:4  And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face
 to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.

SA2 14:5  And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am
 indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

SA2 14:6  And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the
 field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew
 him.

SA2 14:7  And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and
 they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the
 life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so
 they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband
 neither name nor remainder upon the earth.

SA2 14:8  And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give
 charge concerning thee.

SA2 14:9  And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the
 iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be
 guiltless.

SA2 14:10  And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
 me, and he shall not touch thee any more.

SA2 14:11  Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God,
 that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more,
 lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not
 one hair of thy son fall to the earth.

SA2 14:12  Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word
 unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

SA2 14:13  And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing
 against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is
 faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.

SA2 14:14  For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which
 cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he
 devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.

SA2 14:15  Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the
 king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I
 will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the
 request of his handmaid.

SA2 14:16  For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand
 of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance
 of God.

SA2 14:17  Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be
 comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good
 and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.

SA2 14:18  Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I
 pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord
 the king now speak.

SA2 14:19  And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?
 And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none
 can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king
 hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words
 in the mouth of thine handmaid:

SA2 14:20  To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this
 thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to
 know all things that are in the earth.

SA2 14:21  And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go
 therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

SA2 14:22  And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and
 thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found
 grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the
 request of his servant.

SA2 14:23  So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.

SA2 14:24  And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not
 see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's
 face.

SA2 14:25  But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom
 for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there
 was no blemish in him.

SA2 14:26  And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he
 polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he
 weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.

SA2 14:27  And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose
 name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

SA2 14:28  So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's
 face.

SA2 14:29  Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but
 he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would
 not come.

SA2 14:30  Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near
 mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants
 set the field on fire.

SA2 14:31  Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto
 him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?

SA2 14:32  And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come
 hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from
 Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let
 me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.

SA2 14:33  So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for
 Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground
 before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.

SA2 15:1  And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots
 and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

SA2 15:2  And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and
 it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for
 judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And
 he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.

SA2 15:3  And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but
 there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

SA2 15:4  Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that
 every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him
 justice!

SA2 15:5  And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him
 obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.

SA2 15:6  And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king
 for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

SA2 15:7  And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the
 king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the
 LORD, in Hebron.

SA2 15:8  For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying,
 If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the
 LORD.

SA2 15:9  And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to
 Hebron.

SA2 15:10  But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying,
 As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom
 reigneth in Hebron.

SA2 15:11  And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were
 called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.

SA2 15:12  And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor,
 from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the
 conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.

SA2 15:13  And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men
 of Israel are after Absalom.

SA2 15:14  And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
 Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom:
 make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us,
 and smite the city with the edge of the sword.

SA2 15:15  And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are
 ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.

SA2 15:16  And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the
 king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.

SA2 15:17  And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried
 in a place that was far off.

SA2 15:18  And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites,
 and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came
 after him from Gath, passed on before the king.

SA2 15:19  Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also
 with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a
 stranger, and also an exile.

SA2 15:20  Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up
 and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy
 brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.

SA2 15:21  And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my
 lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether
 in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.

SA2 15:22  And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite
 passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.

SA2 15:23  And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
 passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the
 people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.

SA2 15:24  And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the
 ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar
 went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.

SA2 15:25  And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the
 city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me
 again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:

SA2 15:26  But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I,
 let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

SA2 15:27  The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
 return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy
 son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

SA2 15:28  See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come
 word from you to certify me.

SA2 15:29  Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
 Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

SA2 15:30  And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went
 up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that
 was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they
 went up.

SA2 15:31  And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
 with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of
 Ahithophel into foolishness.

SA2 15:32  And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the
 mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him
 with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:

SA2 15:33  Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be
 a burden unto me:

SA2 15:34  But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy
 servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now
 also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of
 Ahithophel.

SA2 15:35  And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests?
 therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the
 king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

SA2 15:36  Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's
 son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every
 thing that ye can hear.

SA2 15:37  So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into
 Jerusalem.

SA2 16:1  And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba
 the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon
 them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an
 hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.

SA2 16:2  And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba
 said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and
 summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint
 in the wilderness may drink.

SA2 16:3  And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto
 the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the
 house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.

SA2 16:4  Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto
 Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in
 thy sight, my lord, O king.

SA2 16:5  And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man
 of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera:
 he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

SA2 16:6  And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David:
 and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his
 left.

SA2 16:7  And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody
 man, and thou man of Belial:

SA2 16:8  The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul,
 in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom
 into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy
 mischief, because thou art a bloody man.

SA2 16:9  Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this
 dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off
 his head.

SA2 16:10  And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?
 so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall
 then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?

SA2 16:11  And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son,
 which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this
 Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden
 him.

SA2 16:12  It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the
 LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

SA2 16:13  And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the
 hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at
 him, and cast dust.

SA2 16:14  And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and
 refreshed themselves there.

SA2 16:15  And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
 Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

SA2 16:16  And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was
 come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save
 the king.

SA2 16:17  And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why
 wentest thou not with thy friend?

SA2 16:18  And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this
 people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I
 abide.

SA2 16:19  And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence
 of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy
 presence.

SA2 16:20  Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we
 shall do.

SA2 16:21  And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
 concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear
 that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are
 with thee be strong.

SA2 16:22  So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom
 went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.

SA2 16:23  And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days,
 was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of
 Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

SA2 17:1  Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve
 thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:

SA2 17:2  And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will
 make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will
 smite the king only:

SA2 17:3  And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou
 seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.

SA2 17:4  And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.

SA2 17:5  Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear
 likewise what he saith.

SA2 17:6  And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying,
 Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if
 not; speak thou.

SA2 17:7  And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given
 is not good at this time.

SA2 17:8  For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be
 mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps
 in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the
 people.

SA2 17:9  Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it
 will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that
 whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that
 follow Absalom.

SA2 17:10  And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion,
 shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty
 man, and they which be with him are valiant men.

SA2 17:11  Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee,
 from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and
 that thou go to battle in thine own person.

SA2 17:12  So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and
 we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of
 all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.

SA2 17:13  Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring
 ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not
 one small stone found there.

SA2 17:14  And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai
 the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had
 appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the
 LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.

SA2 17:15  Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and
 thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and
 thus have I counselled.

SA2 17:16  Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this
 night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king
 be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.

SA2 17:17  Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be
 seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and
 told king David.

SA2 17:18  Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both
 of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well
 in his court; whither they went down.

SA2 17:19  And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and
 spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.

SA2 17:20  And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they
 said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be
 gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find
 them, they returned to Jerusalem.

SA2 17:21  And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out
 of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and
 pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.

SA2 17:22  Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they
 passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that
 was not gone over Jordan.

SA2 17:23  And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
 saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and
 put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried
 in the sepulchre of his father.

SA2 17:24  Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and
 all the men of Israel with him.

SA2 17:25  And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which
 Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to
 Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.

SA2 17:26  So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

SA2 17:27  And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the
 son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of
 Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,

SA2 17:28  Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
 barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched
 pulse,

SA2 17:29  And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and
 for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is
 hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.

SA2 18:1  And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of
 thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.

SA2 18:2  And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of
 Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's
 brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king
 said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.

SA2 18:3  But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee
 away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care
 for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better
 that thou succour us out of the city.

SA2 18:4  And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the
 king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by
 thousands.

SA2 18:5  And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
 gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people
 heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.

SA2 18:6  So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle
 was in the wood of Ephraim;

SA2 18:7  Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of
 David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.

SA2 18:8  For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country:
 and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

SA2 18:9  And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
 mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head
 caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth;
 and the mule that was under him went away.

SA2 18:10  And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
 Absalom hanged in an oak.

SA2 18:11  And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest
 him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have
 given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.

SA2 18:12  And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
 shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against
 the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and
 Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.

SA2 18:13  Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for
 there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set
 thyself against me.

SA2 18:14  Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three
 darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was
 yet alive in the midst of the oak.

SA2 18:15  And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote
 Absalom, and slew him.

SA2 18:16  And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
 after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

SA2 18:17  And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
 wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled
 every one to his tent.

SA2 18:18  Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a
 pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my
 name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is
 called unto this day, Absalom's place.

SA2 18:19  Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the
 king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.

SA2 18:20  And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but
 thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings,
 because the king's son is dead.

SA2 18:21  Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And
 Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

SA2 18:22  Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever,
 let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou
 run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?

SA2 18:23  But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then
 Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

SA2 18:24  And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the
 roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and
 behold a man running alone.

SA2 18:25  And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he
 be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.

SA2 18:26  And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called
 unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king
 said, He also bringeth tidings.

SA2 18:27  And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is
 like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good
 man, and cometh with good tidings.

SA2 18:28  And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell
 down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the
 LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand
 against my lord the king.

SA2 18:29  And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
 answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a
 great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

SA2 18:30  And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
 turned aside, and stood still.

SA2 18:31  And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king:
 for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against
 thee.

SA2 18:32  And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And
 Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against
 thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.

SA2 18:33  And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the
 gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my
 son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

SA2 19:1  And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for
 Absalom.

SA2 19:2  And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
 people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his
 son.

SA2 19:3  And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people
 being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

SA2 19:4  But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice,
 O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

SA2 19:5  And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed
 this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy
 life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy
 wives, and the lives of thy concubines;

SA2 19:6  In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou
 hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for
 this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this
 day, then it had pleased thee well.

SA2 19:7  Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
 servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry
 one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil
 that befell thee from thy youth until now.

SA2 19:8  Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the
 people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people
 came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.

SA2 19:9  And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
 Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he
 delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out
 of the land for Absalom.

SA2 19:10  And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
 therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?

SA2 19:11  And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,
 Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king
 back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even
 to his house.

SA2 19:12  Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are
 ye the last to bring back the king?

SA2 19:13  And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God
 do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me
 continually in the room of Joab.

SA2 19:14  And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of
 one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy
 servants.

SA2 19:15  So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal,
 to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.

SA2 19:16  And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
 hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

SA2 19:17  And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the
 servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants
 with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.

SA2 19:18  And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
 household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell
 down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

SA2 19:19  And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me,
 neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that
 my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his
 heart.

SA2 19:20  For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I
 am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my
 lord the king.

SA2 19:21  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei
 be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?

SA2 19:22  And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that
 ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to
 death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over
 Israel?

SA2 19:23  Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the
 king sware unto him.

SA2 19:24  And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had
 neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from
 the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.

SA2 19:25  And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king,
 that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me,
 Mephibosheth?

SA2 19:26  And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy
 servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the
 king; because thy servant is lame.

SA2 19:27  And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord
 the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.

SA2 19:28  For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the
 king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own
 table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?

SA2 19:29  And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy
 matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

SA2 19:30  And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
 forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.

SA2 19:31  And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over
 Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

SA2 19:32  Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he
 had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a
 very great man.

SA2 19:33  And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will
 feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

SA2 19:34  And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I
 should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?

SA2 19:35  I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good
 and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any
 more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy
 servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?

SA2 19:36  Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why
 should the king recompense it me with such a reward?

SA2 19:37  Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in
 mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But
 behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to
 him what shall seem good unto thee.

SA2 19:38  And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do
 to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt
 require of me, that will I do for thee.

SA2 19:39  And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come
 over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his
 own place.

SA2 19:40  Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and
 all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of
 Israel.

SA2 19:41  And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto
 the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have
 brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over
 Jordan?

SA2 19:42  And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the
 king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have
 we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?

SA2 19:43  And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have
 ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then
 did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back
 our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words
 of the men of Israel.

SA2 20:1  And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
 Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We
 have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every
 man to his tents, O Israel.

SA2 20:2  So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba
 the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan
 even to Jerusalem.

SA2 20:3  And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten
 women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in
 ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the
 day of their death, living in widowhood.

SA2 20:4  Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within
 three days, and be thou here present.

SA2 20:5  So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer
 than the set time which he had appointed him.

SA2 20:6  And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us
 more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after
 him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.

SA2 20:7  And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the
 Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue
 after Sheba the son of Bichri.

SA2 20:8  When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went
 before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and
 upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof;
 and as he went forth it fell out.

SA2 20:9  And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took
 Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

SA2 20:10  But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he
 smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the
 ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his
 brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.

SA2 20:11  And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth
 Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.

SA2 20:12  And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when
 the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the
 highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one
 that came by him stood still.

SA2 20:13  When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after
 Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

SA2 20:14  And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
 Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went
 also after him.

SA2 20:15  And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast
 up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people
 that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.

SA2 20:16  Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray
 you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.

SA2 20:17  And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab?
 And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine
 handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

SA2 20:18  Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying,
 They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.

SA2 20:19  I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou
 seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up
 the inheritance of the LORD?

SA2 20:20  And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I
 should swallow up or destroy.

SA2 20:21  The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of
 Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David:
 deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto
 Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

SA2 20:22  Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut
 off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew
 a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab
 returned to Jerusalem unto the king.

SA2 20:23  Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of
 Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:

SA2 20:24  And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud
 was recorder:

SA2 20:25  And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:

SA2 20:26  And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

SA2 21:1  Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after
 year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for
 Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.

SA2 21:2  And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the
 Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the
 Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to
 slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)

SA2 21:3  Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?
 and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance
 of the LORD?

SA2 21:4  And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of
 Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And
 he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.

SA2 21:5  And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
 devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the
 coasts of Israel,

SA2 21:6  Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them
 up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king
 said, I will give them.

SA2 21:7  But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of
 Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and
 Jonathan the son of Saul.

SA2 21:8  But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom
 she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the
 daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the
 Meholathite:

SA2 21:9  And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they
 hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven
 together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days,
 in the beginning of barley harvest.

SA2 21:10  And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for
 her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon
 them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them
 by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.

SA2 21:11  And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
 concubine of Saul, had done.

SA2 21:12  And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan
 his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street
 of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had
 slain Saul in Gilboa:

SA2 21:13  And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of
 Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.

SA2 21:14  And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
 country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they
 performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for
 the land.

SA2 21:15  Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David
 went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and
 David waxed faint.

SA2 21:16  And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of
 whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded
 with a new sword, thought to have slain David.

SA2 21:17  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
 Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying,
 Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light
 of Israel.

SA2 21:18  And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with
 the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was
 of the sons of the giant.

SA2 21:19  And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where
 Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath
 the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.

SA2 21:20  And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
 stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four
 and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.

SA2 21:21  And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother
 of David slew him.

SA2 21:22  These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of
 David, and by the hand of his servants.

SA2 22:1  And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that
 the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the
 hand of Saul:

SA2 22:2  And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;

SA2 22:3  The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the
 horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest
 me from violence.

SA2 22:4  I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be
 saved from mine enemies.

SA2 22:5  When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made
 me afraid;

SA2 22:6  The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented
 me;

SA2 22:7  In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he
 did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.

SA2 22:8  Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved
 and shook, because he was wroth.

SA2 22:9  There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
 devoured: coals were kindled by it.

SA2 22:10  He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his
 feet.

SA2 22:11  And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the
 wings of the wind.

SA2 22:12  And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and
 thick clouds of the skies.

SA2 22:13  Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

SA2 22:14  The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.

SA2 22:15  And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
 discomfited them.

SA2 22:16  And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world
 were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of
 his nostrils.

SA2 22:17  He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;

SA2 22:18  He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me:
 for they were too strong for me.

SA2 22:19  They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my
 stay.

SA2 22:20  He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
 because he delighted in me.

SA2 22:21  The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the
 cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

SA2 22:22  For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed
 from my God.

SA2 22:23  For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did
 not depart from them.

SA2 22:24  I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
 iniquity.

SA2 22:25  Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
 righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

SA2 22:26  With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the
 upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

SA2 22:27  With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou
 wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

SA2 22:28  And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the
 haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

SA2 22:29  For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.

SA2 22:30  For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over
 a wall.

SA2 22:31  As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is
 a buckler to all them that trust in him.

SA2 22:32  For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?

SA2 22:33  God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

SA2 22:34  He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high
 places.

SA2 22:35  He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by
 mine arms.

SA2 22:36  Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
 gentleness hath made me great.

SA2 22:37  Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.

SA2 22:38  I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not
 again until I had consumed them.

SA2 22:39  And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not
 arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

SA2 22:40  For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up
 against me hast thou subdued under me.

SA2 22:41  Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might
 destroy them that hate me.

SA2 22:42  They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he
 answered them not.

SA2 22:43  Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp
 them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.

SA2 22:44  Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou
 hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve
 me.

SA2 22:45  Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they
 hear, they shall be obedient unto me.

SA2 22:46  Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their
 close places.

SA2 22:47  The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God
 of the rock of my salvation.

SA2 22:48  It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under
 me.

SA2 22:49  And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted
 me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from
 the violent man.

SA2 22:50  Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
 heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

SA2 22:51  He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his
 anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

SA2 23:1  Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
 said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of
 Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

SA2 23:2  The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.

SA2 23:3  The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that
 ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

SA2 23:4  And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,
 even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth
 by clear shining after rain.

SA2 23:5  Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an
 everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my
 salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.

SA2 23:6  But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away,
 because they cannot be taken with hands:

SA2 23:7  But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the
 staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same
 place.

SA2 23:8  These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite
 that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the
 Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.

SA2 23:9  And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the
 three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there
 gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:

SA2 23:10  He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and
 his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day;
 and the people returned after him only to spoil.

SA2 23:11  And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the
 Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground
 full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.

SA2 23:12  But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew
 the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.

SA2 23:13  And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the
 harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines
 pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

SA2 23:14  And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines
 was then in Bethlehem.

SA2 23:15  And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the
 water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!

SA2 23:16  And the three mighty men brake through the host of the
 Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the
 gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink
 thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.

SA2 23:17  And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is
 not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore
 he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.

SA2 23:18  And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
 among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew
 them, and had the name among three.

SA2 23:19  Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain:
 howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

SA2 23:20  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
 Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went
 down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:

SA2 23:21  And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear
 in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out
 of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

SA2 23:22  These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among
 three mighty men.

SA2 23:23  He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the
 first three. And David set him over his guard.

SA2 23:24  Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of
 Dodo of Bethlehem,

SA2 23:25  Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

SA2 23:26  Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

SA2 23:27  Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,

SA2 23:28  Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

SA2 23:29  Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out
 of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,

SA2 23:30  Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,

SA2 23:31  Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,

SA2 23:32  Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,

SA2 23:33  Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,

SA2 23:34  Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the
 son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

SA2 23:35  Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,

SA2 23:36  Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

SA2 23:37  Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the
 son of Zeruiah,

SA2 23:38  Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,

SA2 23:39  Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.

SA2 24:1  And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
 moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.

SA2 24:2  For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with
 him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and
 number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.

SA2 24:3  And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
 people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord
 the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?

SA2 24:4  Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against
 the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from
 the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.

SA2 24:5  And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side
 of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:

SA2 24:6  Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they
 came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,

SA2 24:7  And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the
 Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even
 to Beersheba.

SA2 24:8  So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at
 the end of nine months and twenty days.

SA2 24:9  And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king:
 and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the
 sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.

SA2 24:10  And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.
 And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and
 now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I
 have done very foolishly.

SA2 24:11  For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto
 the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

SA2 24:12  Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three
 things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

SA2 24:13  So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven
 years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months
 before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days'
 pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him
 that sent me.

SA2 24:14  And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now
 into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall
 into the hand of man.

SA2 24:15  So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even
 to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to
 Beersheba seventy thousand men.

SA2 24:16  And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy
 it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed
 the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was
 by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.

SA2 24:17  And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the
 people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these
 sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and
 against my father's house.

SA2 24:18  And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an
 altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.

SA2 24:19  And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
 commanded.

SA2 24:20  And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on
 toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his
 face upon the ground.

SA2 24:21  And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?
 And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the
 LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.

SA2 24:22  And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up
 what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and
 threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.

SA2 24:23  All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And
 Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.

SA2 24:24  And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it
 of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God
 of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and
 the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.

SA2 24:25  And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
 offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and
 the plague was stayed from Israel.
