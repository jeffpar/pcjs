## Information about "MULTI BASE"

    MULTI-BASE is a database management system with many sophisticated
    features to complement its simple file management capabilities.
    
    The program has a built-in screen definer, report writer, forms
    generator, and menu generator.  MULTI-BASE can handle as many records in
    a database as the space on your hard disk will allow.  In fact, when
    first defining your database, you tell how many records you believe you
    will need, and MULTI-BASE will allocate the needed space for these
    records.
    
    The system can be completely menu-driven or you can use simple command
    language to manipulate the data in your database.  Since the
    representation of the data, format of the reports and menus are all
    determined by you, MULTI-BASE offers a great deal of flexibility in the
    way the program is used.
