## Information about "THE BIBLE 5-7 (766,767,768,769,771,772)"

    This disk is part of a seven-disk set with the entire King James version
    of the Bible.  It is in text file format, making it easy to locate
    verses, add passages into documents, or prepare manuscript studies.
    
    Since it is all ASCII text files, each book is a separate file.  When
    you get the disks, the files are archived, or ``squeezed'', so you must
    first unsqueeze them onto either 19 other 360K floppies or onto your
    hard drive.  Be advised that some books of the Bible are too long to fit
    into some wordprocessors that limit the size of documents to the amount
    of available RAM.
    
    To view or search these files, you need to use a wordprocessor or some
    kind of viewing shell.  No such program is provided on this disk.

```
AMO 1:1  The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw
 concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of
 Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.

AMO 1:2  And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from
 Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of
 Carmel shall wither.

AMO 1:3  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for
 four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed
 Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:

AMO 1:4  But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour
 the palaces of Benhadad.

AMO 1:5  I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from
 the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden:
 and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.

AMO 1:6  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I
 will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive
 the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:

AMO 1:7  But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the
 palaces thereof:

AMO 1:8  And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth
 the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the
 remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.

AMO 1:9  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four,
 I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the
 whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:

AMO 1:10  But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the
 palaces thereof.

AMO 1:11  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four,
 I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his
 brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear
 perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:

AMO 1:12  But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of
 Bozrah.

AMO 1:13  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of
 Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
 they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge
 their border:

AMO 1:14  But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour
 the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest
 in the day of the whirlwind:

AMO 1:15  And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together,
 saith the LORD.

AMO 2:1  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I
 will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the
 king of Edom into lime:

AMO 2:2  But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of
 Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound
 of the trumpet:

AMO 2:3  And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all
 the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.

AMO 2:4  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four,
 I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the
 law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused
 them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:

AMO 2:5  But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of
 Jerusalem.

AMO 2:6  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four,
 I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous
 for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;

AMO 2:7  That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and
 turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the
 same maid, to profane my holy name:

AMO 2:8  And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every
 altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.

AMO 2:9  Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the
 height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his
 fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

AMO 2:10  Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years
 through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.

AMO 2:11  And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for
 Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.

AMO 2:12  But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets,
 saying, Prophesy not.

AMO 2:13  Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of
 sheaves.

AMO 2:14  Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong
 shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:

AMO 2:15  Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of
 foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse
 deliver himself.

AMO 2:16  And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in
 that day, saith the LORD.

AMO 3:1  Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of
 Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt,
 saying,

AMO 3:2  You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I
 will punish you for all your iniquities.

AMO 3:3  Can two walk together, except they be agreed?

AMO 3:4  Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young
 lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?

AMO 3:5  Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him?
 shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?

AMO 3:6  Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid?
 shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?

AMO 3:7  Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto
 his servants the prophets.

AMO 3:8  The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who
 can but prophesy?

AMO 3:9  Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of
 Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold
 the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst
 thereof.

AMO 3:10  For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence
 and robbery in their palaces.

AMO 3:11  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even
 round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy
 palaces shall be spoiled.

AMO 3:12  Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the
 lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken
 out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.

AMO 3:13  Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the
 God of hosts,

AMO 3:14  That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon
 him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall
 be cut off, and fall to the ground.

AMO 3:15  And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the
 houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith
 the LORD.

AMO 4:1  Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of
 Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their
 masters, Bring, and let us drink.

AMO 4:2  The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come
 upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with
 fishhooks.

AMO 4:3  And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before
 her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.

AMO 4:4  Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and
 bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:

AMO 4:5  And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and
 publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel,
 saith the Lord GOD.

AMO 4:6  And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and
 want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the
 LORD.

AMO 4:7  And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet
 three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and
 caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the
 piece whereupon it rained not withered.

AMO 4:8  So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but
 they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

AMO 4:9  I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and
 your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the
 palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

AMO 4:10  I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your
 young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I
 have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye
 not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

AMO 4:11  I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and
 Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye
 not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

AMO 4:12  Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do
 this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

AMO 4:13  For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and
 declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and
 treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is
 his name.

AMO 5:1  Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O
 house of Israel.

AMO 5:2  The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is
 forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.

AMO 5:3  For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand
 shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave
 ten, to the house of Israel.

AMO 5:4  For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye
 shall live:

AMO 5:5  But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba:
 for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.

AMO 5:6  Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the
 house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.

AMO 5:7  Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the
 earth,

AMO 5:8  Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow
 of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth
 for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth:
 The LORD is his name:

AMO 5:9  That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled
 shall come against the fortress.

AMO 5:10  They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that
 speaketh uprightly.

AMO 5:11  Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take
 from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall
 not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink
 wine of them.

AMO 5:12  For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they
 afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate
 from their right.

AMO 5:13  Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an
 evil time.

AMO 5:14  Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God
 of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

AMO 5:15  Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate:
 it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of
 Joseph.

AMO 5:16  Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus; Wailing
 shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas!
 and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of
 lamentation to wailing.

AMO 5:17  And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee,
 saith the LORD.

AMO 5:18  Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for
 you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.

AMO 5:19  As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into
 the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.

AMO 5:20  Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very
 dark, and no brightness in it?

AMO 5:21  I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your
 solemn assemblies.

AMO 5:22  Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will
 not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat
 beasts.

AMO 5:23  Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear
 the melody of thy viols.

AMO 5:24  But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty
 stream.

AMO 5:25  Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness
 forty years, O house of Israel?

AMO 5:26  But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your
 images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

AMO 5:27  Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,
 saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.

AMO 6:1  Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of
 Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel
 came!

AMO 6:2  Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the
 great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these
 kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?

AMO 6:3  Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to
 come near;

AMO 6:4  That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their
 couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst
 of the stall;

AMO 6:5  That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves
 instruments of musick, like David;

AMO 6:6  That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief
 ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.

AMO 6:7  Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go
 captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.

AMO 6:8  The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I
 abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver
 up the city with all that is therein.

AMO 6:9  And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that
 they shall die.

AMO 6:10  And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to
 bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the
 sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then
 shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the
 LORD.

AMO 6:11  For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house
 with breaches, and the little house with clefts.

AMO 6:12  Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye
 have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:

AMO 6:13  Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken
 to us horns by our own strength?

AMO 6:14  But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel,
 saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering
 in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.

AMO 7:1  Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed
 grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and,
 lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.

AMO 7:2  And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the
 grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom
 shall Jacob arise? for he is small.

AMO 7:3  The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.

AMO 7:4  Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD
 called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a
 part.

AMO 7:5  Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob
 arise? for he is small.

AMO 7:6  The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord
 GOD.

AMO 7:7  Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by a
 plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

AMO 7:8  And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A
 plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of
 my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:

AMO 7:9  And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of
 Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam
 with the sword.

AMO 7:10  Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel,
 saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel:
 the land is not able to bear all his words.

AMO 7:11  For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel
 shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.

AMO 7:12  Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the
 land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:

AMO 7:13  But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's
 chapel, and it is the king's court.

AMO 7:14  Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither
 was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore
 fruit:

AMO 7:15  And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto
 me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.

AMO 7:16  Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy
 not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.

AMO 7:17  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the
 city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land
 shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel
 shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.

AMO 8:1  Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer
 fruit.

AMO 8:2  And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer
 fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel;
 I will not again pass by them any more.

AMO 8:3  And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the
 Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast
 them forth with silence.

AMO 8:4  Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor
 of the land to fail,

AMO 8:5  Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the
 sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel
 great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?

AMO 8:6  That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of
 shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?

AMO 8:7  The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never
 forget any of their works.

AMO 8:8  Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth
 therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and
 drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.

AMO 8:9  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will
 cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear
 day:

AMO 8:10  And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into
 lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon
 every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end
 thereof as a bitter day.

AMO 8:11  Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine
 in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing
 the words of the LORD:

AMO 8:12  And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the
 east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not
 find it.

AMO 8:13  In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.

AMO 8:14  They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan,
 liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never
 rise up again.

AMO 9:1  I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel
 of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them;
 and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall
 not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.

AMO 9:2  Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though
 they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:

AMO 9:3  And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search
 and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom
 of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:

AMO 9:4  And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I
 command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them
 for evil, and not for good.

AMO 9:5  And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall
 melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly
 like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.

AMO 9:6  It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his
 troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth
 them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.

AMO 9:7  Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of
 Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of
 Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?

AMO 9:8  Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I
 will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not
 utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.

AMO 9:9  For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all
 nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain
 fall upon the earth.

AMO 9:10  All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The
 evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.

AMO 9:11  In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is
 fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and
 I will build it as in the days of old:

AMO 9:12  That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen,
 which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.

AMO 9:13  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall
 overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the
 mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.

AMO 9:14  And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they
 shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant
 vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat
 the fruit of them.

AMO 9:15  And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be
 pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.

DAN 1:1  In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.

DAN 1:2  And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part
 of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar
 to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house
 of his god.

DAN 1:3  And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he
 should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and
 of the princes;

DAN 1:4  Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all
 wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had
 ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the
 learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.

DAN 1:5  And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and
 of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end
 thereof they might stand before the king.

DAN 1:6  Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah,
 Mishael, and Azariah:

DAN 1:7  Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto
 Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to
 Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.

DAN 1:8  But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with
 the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore
 he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.

DAN 1:9  Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince
 of the eunuchs.

DAN 1:10  And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the
 king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your
 faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye
 make me endanger my head to the king.

DAN 1:11  Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set
 over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

DAN 1:12  Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us
 pulse to eat, and water to drink.

DAN 1:13  Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
 countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and
 as thou seest, deal with thy servants.

DAN 1:14  So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.

DAN 1:15  And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and
 fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's
 meat.

DAN 1:16  Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that
 they should drink; and gave them pulse.

DAN 1:17  As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all
 learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.

DAN 1:18  Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring
 them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before
 Nebuchadnezzar.

DAN 1:19  And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none
 like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the
 king.

DAN 1:20  And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king
 enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and
 astrologers that were in all his realm.

DAN 1:21  And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.

DAN 2:1  And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar
 dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from
 him.

DAN 2:2  Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers,
 and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So
 they came and stood before the king.

DAN 2:3  And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was
 troubled to know the dream.

DAN 2:4  Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for
 ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.

DAN 2:5  The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from
 me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation
 thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.

DAN 2:6  But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall
 receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the
 dream, and the interpretation thereof.

DAN 2:7  They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the
 dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.

DAN 2:8  The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the
 time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.

DAN 2:9  But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one
 decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before
 me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know
 that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.

DAN 2:10  The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man
 upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king,
 lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or
 Chaldean.

DAN 2:11  And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none
 other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is
 not with flesh.

DAN 2:12  For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to
 destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

DAN 2:13  And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they
 sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

DAN 2:14  Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain
 of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:

DAN 2:15  He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree
 so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.

DAN 2:16  Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him
 time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.

DAN 2:17  Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah,
 Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:

DAN 2:18  That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this
 secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the
 wise men of Babylon.

DAN 2:19  Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then
 Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

DAN 2:20  Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and
 ever: for wisdom and might are his:

DAN 2:21  And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and
 setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that
 know understanding:

DAN 2:22  He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the
 darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.

DAN 2:23  I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast
 given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired
 of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.

DAN 2:24  Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to
 destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not
 the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto
 the king the interpretation.

DAN 2:25  Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus
 unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known
 unto the king the interpretation.

DAN 2:26  The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar,
 Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the
 interpretation thereof?

DAN 2:27  Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret
 which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the
 magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;

DAN 2:28  But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known
 to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and
 the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;

DAN 2:29  As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed,
 what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh
 known to thee what shall come to pass.

DAN 2:30  But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that
 I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the
 interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy
 heart.

DAN 2:31  Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image,
 whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was
 terrible.

DAN 2:32  This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
 silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,

DAN 2:33  His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.

DAN 2:34  Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote
 the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.

DAN 2:35  Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
 broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer
 threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for
 them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled
 the whole earth.

DAN 2:36  This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before
 the king.

DAN 2:37  Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given
 thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.

DAN 2:38  And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field
 and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee
 ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.

DAN 2:39  And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and
 another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.

DAN 2:40  And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron
 breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all
 these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.

DAN 2:41  And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and
 part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the
 strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.

DAN 2:42  And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so
 the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.

DAN 2:43  And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle
 themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another,
 even as iron is not mixed with clay.

DAN 2:44  And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
 kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to
 other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms,
 and it shall stand for ever.

DAN 2:45  Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain
 without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the
 silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall
 come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation
 thereof sure.

DAN 2:46  Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped
 Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours
 unto him.

DAN 2:47  The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your
 God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing
 thou couldest reveal this secret.

DAN 2:48  Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great
 gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief
 of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.

DAN 2:49  Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and
 Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the
 gate of the king.

DAN 3:1  Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was
 threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the
 plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

DAN 3:2  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the
 governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the
 sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication
 of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

DAN 3:3  Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the
 treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the
 provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that
 Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that
 Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

DAN 3:4  Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations,
 and languages,

DAN 3:5  That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,
 sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and
 worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:

DAN 3:6  And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast
 into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

DAN 3:7  Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the
 cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the
 people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden
 image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

DAN 3:8  Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the
 Jews.

DAN 3:9  They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.

DAN 3:10  Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the
 sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all
 kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:

DAN 3:11  And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast
 into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

DAN 3:12  There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the
 province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have
 not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image
 which thou hast set up.

DAN 3:13  Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach,
 Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.

DAN 3:14  Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach,
 Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image
 which I have set up?

DAN 3:15  Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet,
 flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye
 fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship
 not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery
 furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?

DAN 3:16  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O
 Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.

DAN 3:17  If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the
 burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.

DAN 3:18  But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy
 gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

DAN 3:19  Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was
 changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and
 commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was
 wont to be heated.

DAN 3:20  And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery
 furnace.

DAN 3:21  Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their
 hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning
 fiery furnace.

DAN 3:22  Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace
 exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach,
 Meshach, and Abednego.

DAN 3:23  And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound
 into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

DAN 3:24  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and
 spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into
 the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.

DAN 3:25  He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst
 of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the
 Son of God.

DAN 3:26  Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery
 furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants
 of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach,
 Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.

DAN 3:27  And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors,
 being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no
 power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats
 changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.

DAN 3:28  Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach,
 Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants
 that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their
 bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.

DAN 3:29  Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language,
 which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
 Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill:
 because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.

DAN 3:30  Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the
 province of Babylon.

DAN 4:1  Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that
 dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.

DAN 4:2  I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath
 wrought toward me.

DAN 4:3  How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom
 is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.

DAN 4:4  I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my
 palace:

DAN 4:5  I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and
 the visions of my head troubled me.

DAN 4:6  Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon
 before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the
 dream.

DAN 4:7  Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the
 soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known
 unto me the interpretation thereof.

DAN 4:8  But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar,
 according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods:
 and before him I told the dream, saying,

DAN 4:9  O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the
 spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the
 visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.

DAN 4:10  Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a
 tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.

DAN 4:11  The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto
 heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:

DAN 4:12  The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it
 was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls
 of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.

DAN 4:13  I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher
 and an holy one came down from heaven;

DAN 4:14  He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his
 branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get
 away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:

DAN 4:15  Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a
 band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet
 with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass
 of the earth:

DAN 4:16  Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given
 unto him; and let seven times pass over him.

DAN 4:17  This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the
 word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most
 High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and
 setteth up over it the basest of men.

DAN 4:18  This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar,
 declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my
 kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art
 able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.

DAN 4:19  Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one
 hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar,
 let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar
 answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the
 interpretation thereof to thine enemies.

DAN 4:20  The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height
 reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;

DAN 4:21  Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was
 meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose
 branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:

DAN 4:22  It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy
 greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end
 of the earth.

DAN 4:23  And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from
 heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump
 of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the
 tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let
 his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;

DAN 4:24  This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the
 most High, which is come upon my lord the king:

DAN 4:25  That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with
 the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and
 they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over
 thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
 giveth it to whomsoever he will.

DAN 4:26  And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy
 kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the
 heavens do rule.

DAN 4:27  Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break
 off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the
 poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.

DAN 4:28  All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

DAN 4:29  At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of
 Babylon.

DAN 4:30  The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have
 built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the
 honour of my majesty?

DAN 4:31  While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from
 heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is
 departed from thee.

DAN 4:32  And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with
 the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven
 times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the
 kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.

DAN 4:33  The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was
 driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew
 of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails
 like birds' claws.

DAN 4:34  And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto
 heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most
 High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is
 an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:

DAN 4:35  And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he
 doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants
 of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?

DAN 4:36  At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my
 kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and
 my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent
 majesty was added unto me.

DAN 4:37  Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven,
 all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in
 pride he is able to abase.

DAN 5:1  Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and
 drank wine before the thousand.

DAN 5:2  Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden
 and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the
 temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and
 his concubines, might drink therein.

DAN 5:3  Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple
 of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes,
 his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.

DAN 5:4  They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of
 brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

DAN 5:5  In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over
 against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace:
 and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.

DAN 5:6  Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
 him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one
 against another.

DAN 5:7  The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and
 the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon,
 Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof,
 shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and
 shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.

DAN 5:8  Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the
 writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.

DAN 5:9  Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was
 changed in him, and his lords were astonied.

DAN 5:10  Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came
 into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever:
 let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:

DAN 5:11  There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy
 gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like
 the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy
 father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians,
 astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;

DAN 5:12  Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding,
 interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of
 doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now
 let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.

DAN 5:13  Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and
 said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the
 captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?

DAN 5:14  I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is
 in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found
 in thee.

DAN 5:15  And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before
 me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the
 interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the
 thing:

DAN 5:16  And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and
 dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the
 interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain
 of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.

DAN 5:17  Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to
 thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto
 the king, and make known to him the interpretation.

DAN 5:18  O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a
 kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:

DAN 5:19  And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and
 languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he
 would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put
 down.

DAN 5:20  But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he
 was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:

DAN 5:21  And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like
 the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass
 like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the
 most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it
 whomsoever he will.

DAN 5:22  And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though
 thou knewest all this;

DAN 5:23  But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have
 brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy
 wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the
 gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor
 hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all
 thy ways, hast thou not glorified:

DAN 5:24  Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was
 written.

DAN 5:25  And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
 UPHARSIN.

DAN 5:26  This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy
 kingdom, and finished it.

DAN 5:27  TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.

DAN 5:28  PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.

DAN 5:29  Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and
 put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him,
 that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.

DAN 5:30  In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

DAN 5:31  And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and
 two years old.

DAN 6:1  It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty
 princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;

DAN 6:2  And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the
 princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.

DAN 6:3  Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,
 because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over
 the whole realm.

DAN 6:4  Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel
 concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault;
 forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in
 him.

DAN 6:5  Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this
 Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.

DAN 6:6  Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and
 said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.

DAN 6:7  All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the
 counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal
 statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of
 any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into
 the den of lions.

DAN 6:8  Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be
 not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth
 not.

DAN 6:9  Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.

DAN 6:10  Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his
 house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled
 upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God,
 as he did aforetime.

DAN 6:11  Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
 supplication before his God.

DAN 6:12  Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's
 decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a
 petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be
 cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true,
 according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.

DAN 6:13  Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is
 of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor
 the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.

DAN 6:14  Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with
 himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the
 going down of the sun to deliver him.

DAN 6:15  Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know,
 O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute
 which the king establisheth may be changed.

DAN 6:16  Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into
 the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou
 servest continually, he will deliver thee.

DAN 6:17  And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the
 king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that
 the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.

DAN 6:18  Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting:
 neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went
 from him.

DAN 6:19  Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto
 the den of lions.

DAN 6:20  And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto
 Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the
 living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee
 from the lions?

DAN 6:21  Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.

DAN 6:22  My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that
 they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and
 also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.

DAN 6:23  Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they
 should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the
 den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his
 God.

DAN 6:24  And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused
 Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and
 their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones
 in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.

DAN 6:25  Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that
 dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.

DAN 6:26  I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and
 fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for
 ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion
 shall be even unto the end.

DAN 6:27  He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in
 heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.

DAN 6:28  So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of
 Cyrus the Persian.

DAN 7:1  In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and
 visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum
 of the matters.

DAN 7:2  Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the
 four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.

DAN 7:3  And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.

DAN 7:4  The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the
 wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made
 stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.

DAN 7:5  And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up
 itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the
 teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.

DAN 7:6  After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon
 the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and
 dominion was given to it.

DAN 7:7  After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
 dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth:
 it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it:
 and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten
 horns.

DAN 7:8  I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another
 little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by
 the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a
 mouth speaking great things.

DAN 7:9  I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did
 sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure
 wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.

DAN 7:10  A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
 thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood
 before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.

DAN 7:11  I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn
 spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and
 given to the burning flame.

DAN 7:12  As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken
 away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.

DAN 7:13  I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came
 with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought
 him near before him.

DAN 7:14  And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all
 people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an
 everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which
 shall not be destroyed.

DAN 7:15  I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the
 visions of my head troubled me.

DAN 7:16  I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth
 of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the
 things.

DAN 7:17  These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise
 out of the earth.

DAN 7:18  But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess
 the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

DAN 7:19  Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse
 from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his
 nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with
 his feet;

DAN 7:20  And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which
 came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a
 mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his
 fellows.

DAN 7:21  I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed
 against them;

DAN 7:22  Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints
 of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.

DAN 7:23  Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon
 earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole
 earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.

DAN 7:24  And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise:
 and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the
 first, and he shall subdue three kings.

DAN 7:25  And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear
 out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they
 shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.

DAN 7:26  But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to
 consume and to destroy it unto the end.

DAN 7:27  And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under
 the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most
 High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve
 and obey him.

DAN 7:28  Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations
 much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in
 my heart.

DAN 8:1  In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared
 unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.

DAN 8:2  And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at
 Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a
 vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.

DAN 8:3  Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before
 the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was
 higher than the other, and the higher came up last.

DAN 8:4  I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that
 no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver
 out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.

DAN 8:5  And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the
 face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a
 notable horn between his eyes.

DAN 8:6  And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing
 before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.

DAN 8:7  And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler
 against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no
 power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and
 stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his
 hand.

DAN 8:8  Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the
 great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four
 winds of heaven.

DAN 8:9  And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding
 great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.

DAN 8:10  And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some
 of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.

DAN 8:11  Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him
 the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast
 down.

DAN 8:12  And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of
 transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
 practised, and prospered.

DAN 8:13  Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that
 certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily
 sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary
 and the host to be trodden under foot?

DAN 8:14  And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then
 shall the sanctuary be cleansed.

DAN 8:15  And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and
 sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance
 of a man.

DAN 8:16  And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which
 called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.

DAN 8:17  So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and
 fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the
 time of the end shall be the vision.

DAN 8:18  Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face
 toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.

DAN 8:19  And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last
 end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.

DAN 8:20  The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and
 Persia.

DAN 8:21  And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is
 between his eyes is the first king.

DAN 8:22  Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms
 shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.

DAN 8:23  And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are
 come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark
 sentences, shall stand up.

DAN 8:24  And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall
 destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the
 mighty and the holy people.

DAN 8:25  And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his
 hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy
 many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be
 broken without hand.

DAN 8:26  And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true:
 wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.

DAN 8:27  And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose
 up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none
 understood it.

DAN 9:1  In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the
 Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;

DAN 9:2  In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number
 of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that
 he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.

DAN 9:3  And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
 supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:

DAN 9:4  And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O
 Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that
 love him, and to them that keep his commandments;

DAN 9:5  We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done
 wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy
 judgments:

DAN 9:6  Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake
 in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people
 of the land.

DAN 9:7  O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of
 faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of
 Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through
 all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass
 that they have trespassed against thee.

DAN 9:8  O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our
 princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.

DAN 9:9  To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have
 rebelled against him;

DAN 9:10  Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his
 laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.

DAN 9:11  Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that
 they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the
 oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have
 sinned against him.

DAN 9:12  And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and
 against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for
 under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.

DAN 9:13  As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us:
 yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from
 our iniquities, and understand thy truth.

DAN 9:14  Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon
 us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we
 obeyed not his voice.

DAN 9:15  And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out
 of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at
 this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.

DAN 9:16  O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine
 anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain:
 because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and
 thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.

DAN 9:17  Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his
 supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is
 desolate, for the Lord's sake.

DAN 9:18  O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold
 our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not
 present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy
 great mercies.

DAN 9:19  O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for
 thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.

DAN 9:20  And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the
 sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my
 God for the holy mountain of my God;

DAN 9:21  Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I
 had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched
 me about the time of the evening oblation.

DAN 9:22  And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now
 come forth to give thee skill and understanding.

DAN 9:23  At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and
 I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand
 the matter, and consider the vision.

DAN 9:24  Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city,
 to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make
 reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and
 to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.

DAN 9:25  Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the
 commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince
 shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built
 again, and the wall, even in troublous times.

DAN 9:26  And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not
 for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the
 city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto
 the end of the war desolations are determined.

DAN 9:27  And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the
 midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and
 for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until
 the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

DAN 10:1  In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto
 Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the
 time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding
 of the vision.

DAN 10:2  In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.

DAN 10:3  I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth,
 neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.

DAN 10:4  And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the
 side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;

DAN 10:5  Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man
 clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:

DAN 10:6  His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of
 lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in
 colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a
 multitude.

DAN 10:7  And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw
 not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide
 themselves.

DAN 10:8  Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there
 remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into
 corruption, and I retained no strength.

DAN 10:9  Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his
 words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.

DAN 10:10  And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon
 the palms of my hands.

DAN 10:11  And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the
 words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent.
 And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.

DAN 10:12  Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that
 thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy
 God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.

DAN 10:13  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty
 days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I
 remained there with the kings of Persia.

DAN 10:14  Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people
 in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.

DAN 10:15  And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the
 ground, and I became dumb.

DAN 10:16  And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my
 lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before
 me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have
 retained no strength.

DAN 10:17  For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for
 as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there
 breath left in me.

DAN 10:18  Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a
 man, and he strengthened me,

DAN 10:19  And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be
 strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was
 strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.

DAN 10:20  Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will
 I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth,
 lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.

DAN 10:21  But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth:
 and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your
 prince.

DAN 11:1  Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm
 and to strengthen him.

DAN 11:2  And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet
 three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and
 by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of
 Grecia.

DAN 11:3  And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
 dominion, and do according to his will.

DAN 11:4  And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be
 divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor
 according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked
 up, even for others beside those.

DAN 11:5  And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes;
 and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a
 great dominion.

DAN 11:6  And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the
 king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an
 agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he
 stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and
 he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.

DAN 11:7  But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate,
 which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king
 of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:

DAN 11:8  And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their
 princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall
 continue more years than the king of the north.

DAN 11:9  So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall
 return into his own land.

DAN 11:10  But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of
 great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through:
 then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.

DAN 11:11  And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come
 forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set
 forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.

DAN 11:12  And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted
 up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be
 strengthened by it.

DAN 11:13  For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a
 multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain
 years with a great army and with much riches.

DAN 11:14  And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the
 south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the
 vision; but they shall fall.

DAN 11:15  So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take
 the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand,
 neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.

DAN 11:16  But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
 will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious
 land, which by his hand shall be consumed.

DAN 11:17  He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole
 kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him
 the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side,
 neither be for him.

DAN 11:18  After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take
 many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him
 to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.

DAN 11:19  Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he
 shall stumble and fall, and not be found.

DAN 11:20  Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory
 of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger,
 nor in battle.

DAN 11:21  And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall
 not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and
 obtain the kingdom by flatteries.

DAN 11:22  And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before
 him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.

DAN 11:23  And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he
 shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.

DAN 11:24  He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
 province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his
 fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and
 riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even
 for a time.

DAN 11:25  And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king
 of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up
 to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they
 shall forecast devices against him.

DAN 11:26  Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
 him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.

DAN 11:27  And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they
 shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end
 shall be at the time appointed.

DAN 11:28  Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart
 shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to
 his own land.

DAN 11:29  At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south;
 but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.

DAN 11:30  For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall
 be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so
 shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that
 forsake the holy covenant.

DAN 11:31  And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
 sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they
 shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.

DAN 11:32  And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by
 flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do
 exploits.

DAN 11:33  And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet
 they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many
 days.

DAN 11:34  Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help:
 but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.

DAN 11:35  And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to
 purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet
 for a time appointed.

DAN 11:36  And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt
 himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous
 things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be
 accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.

DAN 11:37  Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of
 women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.

DAN 11:38  But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom
 his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious
 stones, and pleasant things.

DAN 11:39  Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom
 he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule
 over many, and shall divide the land for gain.

DAN 11:40  And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him:
 and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with
 chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the
 countries, and shall overflow and pass over.

DAN 11:41  He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall
 be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and
 Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.

DAN 11:42  He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the
 land of Egypt shall not escape.

DAN 11:43  But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
 silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the
 Ethiopians shall be at his steps.

DAN 11:44  But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him:
 therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make
 away many.

DAN 11:45  And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas
 in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall
 help him.

DAN 12:1  And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
 standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of
 trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time:
 and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found
 written in the book.

DAN 12:2  And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,
 some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.

DAN 12:3  And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament;
 and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.

DAN 12:4  But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the
 time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.

DAN 12:5  Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on
 this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank
 of the river.

DAN 12:6  And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters
 of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?

DAN 12:7  And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters
 of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto
 heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time,
 times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power
 of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.

DAN 12:8  And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall
 be the end of these things?

DAN 12:9  And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and
 sealed till the time of the end.

DAN 12:10  Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked
 shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise
 shall understand.

DAN 12:11  And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and
 the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two
 hundred and ninety days.

DAN 12:12  Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred
 and five and thirty days.

DAN 12:13  But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand
 in thy lot at the end of the days.

EZE 1:1  Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the
 fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar,
 that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.

EZE 1:2  In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king
 Jehoiachin's captivity,

EZE 1:3  The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son
 of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand
 of the LORD was there upon him.

EZE 1:4  And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great
 cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out
 of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.

EZE 1:5  Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
 creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.

EZE 1:6  And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.

EZE 1:7  And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like
 the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished
 brass.

EZE 1:8  And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides;
 and they four had their faces and their wings.

EZE 1:9  Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they
 went; they went every one straight forward.

EZE 1:10  As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a
 man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of
 an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.

EZE 1:11  Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two
 wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.

EZE 1:12  And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to
 go, they went; and they turned not when they went.

EZE 1:13  As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was
 like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and
 down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire
 went forth lightning.

EZE 1:14  And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a
 flash of lightning.

EZE 1:15  Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth
 by the living creatures, with his four faces.

EZE 1:16  The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour
 of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their
 work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.

EZE 1:17  When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not
 when they went.

EZE 1:18  As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and
 their rings were full of eyes round about them four.

EZE 1:19  And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when
 the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted
 up.

EZE 1:20  Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their
 spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit
 of the living creature was in the wheels.

EZE 1:21  When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and
 when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over
 against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

EZE 1:22  And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
 creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over
 their heads above.

EZE 1:23  And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the
 other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two,
 which covered on that side, their bodies.

EZE 1:24  And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise
 of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the
 noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.

EZE 1:25  And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads,
 when they stood, and had let down their wings.

EZE 1:26  And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of
 a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the
 throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.

EZE 1:27  And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round
 about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the
 appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of
 fire, and it had brightness round about.

EZE 1:28  As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain,
 so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance
 of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my
 face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.

EZE 2:1  And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak
 unto thee.

EZE 2:2  And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon
 my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.

EZE 2:3  And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of
 Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their
 fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.

EZE 2:4  For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto
 them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 2:5  And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for
 they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet
 among them.

EZE 2:6  And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid
 of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell
 among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their
 looks, though they be a rebellious house.

EZE 2:7  And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or
 whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.

EZE 2:8  But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou
 rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give
 thee.

EZE 2:9  And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll
 of a book was therein;

EZE 2:10  And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without:
 and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.

EZE 3:1  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this
 roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.

EZE 3:2  So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.

EZE 3:3  And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy
 bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my
 mouth as honey for sweetness.

EZE 3:4  And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of
 Israel, and speak with my words unto them.

EZE 3:5  For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard
 language, but to the house of Israel;

EZE 3:6  Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose
 words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would
 have hearkened unto thee.

EZE 3:7  But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not
 hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.

EZE 3:8  Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy
 forehead strong against their foreheads.

EZE 3:9  As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them
 not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.

EZE 3:10  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak
 unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.

EZE 3:11  And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy
 people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether
 they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

EZE 3:12  Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great
 rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.

EZE 3:13  I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that
 touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a
 noise of a great rushing.

EZE 3:14  So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in
 bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong
 upon me.

EZE 3:15  Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the
 river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished
 among them seven days.

EZE 3:16  And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the
 LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 3:17  Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel:
 therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.

EZE 3:18  When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest
 him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save
 his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I
 require at thine hand.

EZE 3:19  Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor
 from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered
 thy soul.

EZE 3:20  Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and
 commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die:
 because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his
 righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will
 I require at thine hand.

EZE 3:21  Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin
 not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also
 thou hast delivered thy soul.

EZE 3:22  And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me,
 Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.

EZE 3:23  Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory
 of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and
 I fell on my face.

EZE 3:24  Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake
 with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.

EZE 3:25  But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and
 shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:

EZE 3:26  And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou
 shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious
 house.

EZE 3:27  But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say
 unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he
 that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.

EZE 4:1  Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and
 pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem:

EZE 4:2  And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a
 mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams
 against it round about.

EZE 4:3  Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of
 iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be
 besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the
 house of Israel.

EZE 4:4  Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of
 Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon
 it thou shalt bear their iniquity.

EZE 4:5  For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according
 to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear
 the iniquity of the house of Israel.

EZE 4:6  And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and
 thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have
 appointed thee each day for a year.

EZE 4:7  Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and
 thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.

EZE 4:8  And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee
 from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.

EZE 4:9  Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles,
 and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread
 thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy
 side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.

EZE 4:10  And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels
 a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.

EZE 4:11  Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin:
 from time to time shalt thou drink.

EZE 4:12  And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with
 dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.

EZE 4:13  And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their
 defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.

EZE 4:14  Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for
 from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of
 itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my
 mouth.

EZE 4:15  Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's
 dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.

EZE 4:16  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff
 of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and
 they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:

EZE 4:17  That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with
 another, and consume away for their iniquity.

EZE 5:1  And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's
 razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take
 thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.

EZE 5:2  Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when
 the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and
 smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind;
 and I will draw out a sword after them.

EZE 5:3  Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy
 skirts.

EZE 5:4  Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and
 burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house
 of Israel.

EZE 5:5  Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst
 of the nations and countries that are round about her.

EZE 5:6  And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the
 nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her:
 for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked
 in them.

EZE 5:7  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the
 nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither
 have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the
 nations that are round about you;

EZE 5:8  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against
 thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the
 nations.

EZE 5:9  And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will
 not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.

EZE 5:10  Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and
 the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and
 the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.

EZE 5:11  Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast
 defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine
 abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye
 spare, neither will I have any pity.

EZE 5:12  A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine
 shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by
 the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the
 winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.

EZE 5:13  Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to
 rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD
 have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.

EZE 5:14  Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations
 that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.

EZE 5:15  So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an
 astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute
 judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD
 have spoken it.

EZE 5:16  When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be
 for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will
 increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:

EZE 5:17  So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall
 bereave thee: and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will
 bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it.

EZE 6:1  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 6:2  Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy
 against them,

EZE 6:3  And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus
 saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and
 to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will
 destroy your high places.

EZE 6:4  And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken:
 and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.

EZE 6:5  And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before
 their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.

EZE 6:6  In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the
 high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made
 desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut
 down, and your works may be abolished.

EZE 6:7  And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I
 am the LORD.

EZE 6:8  Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape
 the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the
 countries.

EZE 6:9  And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations
 whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their
 whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a
 whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils
 which they have committed in all their abominations.

EZE 6:10  And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in
 vain that I would do this evil unto them.

EZE 6:11  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy
 foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for
 they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.

EZE 6:12  He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near
 shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by
 the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.

EZE 6:13  Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be
 among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the
 tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick
 oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.

EZE 6:14  So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate,
 yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their
 habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 7:1  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 7:2  Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of
 Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.

EZE 7:3  Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon
 thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon
 thee all thine abominations.

EZE 7:4  And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I
 will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the
 midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 7:5  Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.

EZE 7:6  An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is
 come.

EZE 7:7  The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the
 time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the
 mountains.

EZE 7:8  Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine
 anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will
 recompense thee for all thine abominations.

EZE 7:9  And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will
 recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the
 midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.

EZE 7:10  Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the
 rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.

EZE 7:11  Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall
 remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's: neither shall there be
 wailing for them.

EZE 7:12  The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice,
 nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.

EZE 7:13  For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they
 were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which
 shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his
 life.

EZE 7:14  They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth
 to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.

EZE 7:15  The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he
 that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city,
 famine and pestilence shall devour him.

EZE 7:16  But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the
 mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his
 iniquity.

EZE 7:17  All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.

EZE 7:18  They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall
 cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their
 heads.

EZE 7:19  They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be
 removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the
 day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither
 fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.

EZE 7:20  As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they
 made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein:
 therefore have I set it far from them.

EZE 7:21  And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and
 to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.

EZE 7:22  My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret
 place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.

EZE 7:23  Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is
 full of violence.

EZE 7:24  Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall
 possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and
 their holy places shall be defiled.

EZE 7:25  Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be
 none.

EZE 7:26  Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour;
 then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from
 the priest, and counsel from the ancients.

EZE 7:27  The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with
 desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will
 do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge
 them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 8:1  And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the
 fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat
 before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.

EZE 8:2  Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the
 appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward,
 as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.

EZE 8:3  And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine
 head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and
 brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate
 that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy,
 which provoketh to jealousy.

EZE 8:4  And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according
 to the vision that I saw in the plain.

EZE 8:5  Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way
 toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and
 behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the
 entry.

EZE 8:6  He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even
 the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I
 should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt
 see greater abominations.

EZE 8:7  And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold
 a hole in the wall.

EZE 8:8  Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had
 digged in the wall, behold a door.

EZE 8:9  And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that
 they do here.

EZE 8:10  So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and
 abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon
 the wall round about.

EZE 8:11  And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house
 of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with
 every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.

EZE 8:12  Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients
 of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his
 imagery? for they say, the LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the
 earth.

EZE 8:13  He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater
 abominations that they do.

EZE 8:14  Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which
 was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.

EZE 8:15  Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee
 yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.

EZE 8:16  And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and,
 behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the
 altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple
 of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun
 toward the east.

EZE 8:17  Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a
 light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which
 they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have
 returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.

EZE 8:18  Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither
 will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet
 will I not hear them.

EZE 9:1  He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that
 have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying
 weapon in his hand.

EZE 9:2  And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth
 toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man
 among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and
 they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.

EZE 9:3  And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,
 whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man
 clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;

EZE 9:4  And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through
 the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that
 sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.

EZE 9:5  And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the
 city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:

EZE 9:6  Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and
 women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my
 sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.

EZE 9:7  And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the
 slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.

EZE 9:8  And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left,
 that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy
 all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?

EZE 9:9  Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is
 exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of
 perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD
 seeth not.

EZE 9:10  And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have
 pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.

EZE 9:11  And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his
 side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.

EZE 10:1  Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head
 of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the
 appearance of the likeness of a throne.

EZE 10:2  And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between
 the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire
 from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in
 my sight.

EZE 10:3  Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man
 went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

EZE 10:4  Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over
 the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the
 court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.

EZE 10:5  And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer
 court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.

EZE 10:6  And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with
 linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims;
 then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.

EZE 10:7  And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims
 unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it
 into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.

EZE 10:8  And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under
 their wings.

EZE 10:9  And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel
 by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the
 wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.

EZE 10:10  And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a
 wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.

EZE 10:11  When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as
 they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they
 turned not as they went.

EZE 10:12  And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their
 wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that
 they four had.

EZE 10:13  As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.

EZE 10:14  And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
 cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of
 a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

EZE 10:15  And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I
 saw by the river of Chebar.

EZE 10:16  And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the
 cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels
 also turned not from beside them.

EZE 10:17  When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these
 lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.

EZE 10:18  Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the
 house, and stood over the cherubims.

EZE 10:19  And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the
 earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and
 every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD's house; and the
 glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

EZE 10:20  This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by
 the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.

EZE 10:21  Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the
 likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

EZE 10:22  And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by
 the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one
 straight forward.

EZE 11:1  Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate
 of the LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the
 gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and
 Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.

EZE 11:2  Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise
 mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:

EZE 11:3  Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the
 caldron, and we be the flesh.

EZE 11:4  Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.

EZE 11:5  And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak;
 Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the
 things that come into your mind, every one of them.

EZE 11:6  Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the
 streets thereof with the slain.

EZE 11:7  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid
 in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I
 will bring you forth out of the midst of it.

EZE 11:8  Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith
 the Lord GOD.

EZE 11:9  And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into
 the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.

EZE 11:10  Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of
 Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 11:11  This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh
 in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel:

EZE 11:12  And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my
 statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners
 of the heathen that are round about you.

EZE 11:13  And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of
 Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and
 said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?

EZE 11:14  Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 11:15  Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy
 kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is
 this land given in possession.

EZE 11:16  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them
 far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the
 countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where
 they shall come.

EZE 11:17  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from
 the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been
 scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

EZE 11:18  And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the
 detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.

EZE 11:19  And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within
 you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them
 an heart of flesh:

EZE 11:20  That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do
 them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

EZE 11:21  But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their
 detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon
 their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 11:22  Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside
 them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

EZE 11:23  And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and
 stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.

EZE 11:24  Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the
 Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I
 had seen went up from me.

EZE 11:25  Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD
 had shewed me.

EZE 12:1  The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,

EZE 12:2  Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which
 have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they
 are a rebellious house.

EZE 12:3  Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and
 remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another
 place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a
 rebellious house.

EZE 12:4  Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff
 for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go
 forth into captivity.

EZE 12:5  Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.

EZE 12:6  In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it
 forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the
 ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.

EZE 12:7  And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as
 stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine
 hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder
 in their sight.

EZE 12:8  And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

EZE 12:9  Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said
 unto thee, What doest thou?

EZE 12:10  Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth
 the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.

EZE 12:11  Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto
 them: they shall remove and go into captivity.

EZE 12:12  And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder
 in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry
 out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his
 eyes.

EZE 12:13  My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my
 snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet
 shall he not see it, though he shall die there.

EZE 12:14  And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help
 him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.

EZE 12:15  And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them
 among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.

EZE 12:16  But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the
 famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations
 among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 12:17  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

EZE 12:18  Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with
 trembling and with carefulness;

EZE 12:19  And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their
 bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her
 land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all
 them that dwell therein.

EZE 12:20  And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land
 shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 12:21  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 12:22  Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel,
 saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?

EZE 12:23  Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this
 proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but
 say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.

EZE 12:24  For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination
 within the house of Israel.

EZE 12:25  For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak
 shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O
 rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord
 GOD.

EZE 12:26  Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.

EZE 12:27  Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that
 he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are
 far off.

EZE 12:28  Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none
 of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be
 done, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 13:1  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 13:2  Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that
 prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear
 ye the word of the LORD;

EZE 13:3  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow
 their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

EZE 13:4  O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

EZE 13:5  Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the
 house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.

EZE 13:6  They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith:
 and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they
 would confirm the word.

EZE 13:7  Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying
 divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken?

EZE 13:8  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and
 seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 13:9  And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that
 divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall
 they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they
 enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

EZE 13:10  Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace;
 and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it
 with untempered morter:

EZE 13:11  Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall
 fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall
 fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.

EZE 13:12  Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is
 the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?

EZE 13:13  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy
 wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and
 great hailstones in my fury to consume it.

EZE 13:14  So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered
 morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall
 be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst
 thereof: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 13:15  Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that
 have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The wall is no
 more, neither they that daubed it;

EZE 13:16  To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning
 Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace,
 saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 13:17  Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy
 people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against
 them,

EZE 13:18  And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows
 to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt
 souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive
 that come unto you?

EZE 13:19  And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and
 for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the
 souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your
 lies?

EZE 13:20  Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your
 pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear
 them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt
 to make them fly.

EZE 13:21  Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your
 hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know
 that I am the LORD.

EZE 13:22  Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom
 I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should
 not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:

EZE 13:23  Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I
 will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the
 LORD.

EZE 14:1  Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.

EZE 14:2  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 14:3  Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put
 the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired
 of at all by them?

EZE 14:4  Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
 GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his
 heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and
 cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according
 to the multitude of his idols;

EZE 14:5  That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they
 are all estranged from me through their idols.

EZE 14:6  Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
 Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from
 all your abominations.

EZE 14:7  For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
 sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his
 idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his
 face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD
 will answer him by myself:

EZE 14:8  And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and
 a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall
 know that I am the LORD.

EZE 14:9  And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the
 LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and
 will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.

EZE 14:10  And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment
 of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him;

EZE 14:11  That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be
 polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my
 people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 14:12  The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,

EZE 14:13  Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing
 grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the
 staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off
 man and beast from it:

EZE 14:14  Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they
 should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord
 GOD.

EZE 14:15  If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil
 it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the
 beasts:

EZE 14:16  Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
 GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be
 delivered, but the land shall be desolate.

EZE 14:17  Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the
 land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:

EZE 14:18  Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
 GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be
 delivered themselves.

EZE 14:19  Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon
 it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:

EZE 14:20  Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
 GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver
 their own souls by their righteousness.

EZE 14:21  For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore
 judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome
 beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?

EZE 14:22  Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought
 forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and
 ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning
 the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have
 brought upon it.

EZE 14:23  And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings:
 and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in
 it, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 15:1  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 15:2  Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a
 branch which is among the trees of the forest?

EZE 15:3  Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of
 it to hang any vessel thereon?

EZE 15:4  Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both
 the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?

EZE 15:5  Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less
 shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is
 burned?

EZE 15:6  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees
 of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem.

EZE 15:7  And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one
 fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the
 LORD, when I set my face against them.

EZE 15:8  And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a
 trespass, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 16:1  Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 16:2  Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

EZE 16:3  And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy
 nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother
 an Hittite.

EZE 16:4  And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not
 cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted
 at all, nor swaddled at all.

EZE 16:5  None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
 compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the
 lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.

EZE 16:6  And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood,
 I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee
 when thou wast in thy blood, Live.

EZE 16:7  I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast
 increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy
 breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and
 bare.

EZE 16:8  Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was
 the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness:
 yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord
 GOD, and thou becamest mine.

EZE 16:9  Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood
 from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.

EZE 16:10  I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers'
 skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.

EZE 16:11  I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy
 hands, and a chain on thy neck.

EZE 16:12  And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a
 beautiful crown upon thine head.

EZE 16:13  Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of
 fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and
 honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper
 into a kingdom.

EZE 16:14  And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it
 was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord
 GOD.

EZE 16:15  But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot
 because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that
 passed by; his it was.

EZE 16:16  And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places
 with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall
 not come, neither shall it be so.

EZE 16:17  Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver,
 which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit
 whoredom with them,

EZE 16:18  And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou
 hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.

EZE 16:19  My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey,
 wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour:
 and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 16:20  Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast
 borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is
 this of thy whoredoms a small matter,

EZE 16:21  That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them
 to pass through the fire for them?

EZE 16:22  And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not
 remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast
 polluted in thy blood.

EZE 16:23  And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee!
 saith the LORD GOD;)

EZE 16:24  That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made
 thee an high place in every street.

EZE 16:25  Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast
 made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that
 passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.

EZE 16:26  Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
 neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me
 to anger.

EZE 16:27  Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have
 diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that
 hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd
 way.

EZE 16:28  Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou
 wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest
 not be satisfied.

EZE 16:29  Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan
 unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith.

EZE 16:30  How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest all
 these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;

EZE 16:31  In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every
 way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an
 harlot, in that thou scornest hire;

EZE 16:32  But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers
 instead of her husband!

EZE 16:33  They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy
 lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy
 whoredom.

EZE 16:34  And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,
 whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a
 reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.

EZE 16:35  Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:

EZE 16:36  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and
 thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all
 the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou
 didst give unto them;

EZE 16:37  Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast
 taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou
 hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will
 discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.

EZE 16:38  And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood
 are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.

EZE 16:39  And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down
 thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip
 thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee
 naked and bare.

EZE 16:40  They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall
 stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.

EZE 16:41  And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments
 upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from
 playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.

EZE 16:42  So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall
 depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.

EZE 16:43  Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast
 fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy
 way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this
 lewdness above all thine abominations.

EZE 16:44  Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against
 thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.

EZE 16:45  Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her
 children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands
 and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

EZE 16:46  And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell
 at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is
 Sodom and her daughters.

EZE 16:47  Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their
 abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted
 more than they in all thy ways.

EZE 16:48  As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she
 nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.

EZE 16:49  Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of
 bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did
 she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.

EZE 16:50  And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
 therefore I took them away as I saw good.

EZE 16:51  Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
 multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters
 in all thine abominations which thou hast done.

EZE 16:52  Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for
 thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more
 righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in
 that thou hast justified thy sisters.

EZE 16:53  When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and
 her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I
 bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:

EZE 16:54  That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in
 all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.

EZE 16:55  When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their
 former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former
 estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.

EZE 16:56  For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of
 thy pride,

EZE 16:57  Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach
 of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters
 of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.

EZE 16:58  Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.

EZE 16:59  For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast
 done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.

EZE 16:60  Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of
 thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.

EZE 16:61  Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt
 receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto
 thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.

EZE 16:62  And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that
 I am the LORD:

EZE 16:63  That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy
 mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all
 that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 17:1  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 17:2  Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of
 Israel;

EZE 17:3  And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings,
 longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto
 Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:

EZE 17:4  He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land
 of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.

EZE 17:5  He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful
 field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.

EZE 17:6  And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose
 branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it
 became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.

EZE 17:7  There was also another great eagle with great wings and many
 feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot
 forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her
 plantation.

EZE 17:8  It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring
 forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.

EZE 17:9  Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not
 pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it
 shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or
 many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.

EZE 17:10  Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly
 wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where
 it grew.

EZE 17:11  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 17:12  Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean?
 tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken
 the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;

EZE 17:13  And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and
 hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:

EZE 17:14  That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up,
 but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.

EZE 17:15  But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt,
 that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he
 escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be
 delivered?

EZE 17:16  As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king
 dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he
 brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.

EZE 17:17  Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make
 for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many
 persons:

EZE 17:18  Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he
 had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.

EZE 17:19  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that
 he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I
 recompense upon his own head.

EZE 17:20  And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my
 snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his
 trespass that he hath trespassed against me.

EZE 17:21  And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the
 sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall
 know that I the LORD have spoken it.

EZE 17:22  Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch
 of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young
 twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:

EZE 17:23  In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it
 shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it
 shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof
 shall they dwell.

EZE 17:24  And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have
 brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the
 green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken
 and have done it.

EZE 18:1  The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

EZE 18:2  What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel,
 saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set
 on edge?

EZE 18:3  As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to
 use this proverb in Israel.

EZE 18:4  Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the
 soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.

EZE 18:5  But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,

EZE 18:6  And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his
 eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his
 neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,

EZE 18:7  And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his
 pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the
 hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;

EZE 18:8  He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any
 increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true
 judgment between man and man,

EZE 18:9  Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal
 truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 18:10  If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that
 doeth the like to any one of these things,

EZE 18:11  And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the
 mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,

EZE 18:12  Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath
 not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath
 committed abomination,

EZE 18:13  Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then
 live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely
 die; his blood shall be upon him.

EZE 18:14  Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which
 he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,

EZE 18:15  That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his
 eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's
 wife,

EZE 18:16  Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither
 hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath
 covered the naked with a garment,

EZE 18:17  That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received
 usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes;
 he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.

EZE 18:18  As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother
 by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he
 shall die in his iniquity.

EZE 18:19  Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father?
 When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my
 statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.

EZE 18:20  The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the
 iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the
 son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness
 of the wicked shall be upon him.

EZE 18:21  But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
 committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right,
 he shall surely live, he shall not die.

EZE 18:22  All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be
 mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.

EZE 18:23  Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the
 Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?

EZE 18:24  But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and
 committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the
 wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done
 shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his
 sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.

EZE 18:25  Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house of
 Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?

EZE 18:26  When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and
 committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done
 shall he die.

EZE 18:27  Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he
 hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his
 soul alive.

EZE 18:28  Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions
 that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

EZE 18:29  Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal. O
 house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?

EZE 18:30  Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according
 to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your
 transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.

EZE 18:31  Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
 transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die,
 O house of Israel?

EZE 18:32  For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the
 Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.

EZE 19:1  Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,

EZE 19:2  And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she
 nourished her whelps among young lions.

EZE 19:3  And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it
 learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.

EZE 19:4  The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they
 brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.

EZE 19:5  Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she
 took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.

EZE 19:6  And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and
 learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.

EZE 19:7  And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities;
 and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his
 roaring.

EZE 19:8  Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces,
 and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.

EZE 19:9  And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of
 Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard
 upon the mountains of Israel.

EZE 19:10  Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she
 was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.

EZE 19:11  And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and
 her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her
 height with the multitude of her branches.

EZE 19:12  But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and
 the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered;
 the fire consumed them.

EZE 19:13  And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
 ground.

EZE 19:14  And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured
 her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a
 lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

EZE 20:1  And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the
 tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire
 of the LORD, and sat before me.

EZE 20:2  Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

EZE 20:3  Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus
 saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord
 GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.

EZE 20:4  Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to
 know the abominations of their fathers:

EZE 20:5  And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose
 Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made
 myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto
 them, saying, I am the LORD your God;

EZE 20:6  In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth
 of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with
 milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:

EZE 20:7  Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his
 eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your
 God.

EZE 20:8  But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did
 not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they
 forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them,
 to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

EZE 20:9  But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted
 before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known
 unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.

EZE 20:10  Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and
 brought them into the wilderness.

EZE 20:11  And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if
 a man do, he shall even live in them.

EZE 20:12  Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and
 them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.

EZE 20:13  But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they
 walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do,
 he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I
 said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.

EZE 20:14  But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted
 before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.

EZE 20:15  Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I
 would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk
 and honey, which is the glory of all lands;

EZE 20:16  Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes,
 but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.

EZE 20:17  Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did
 I make an end of them in the wilderness.

EZE 20:18  But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the
 statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile
 yourselves with their idols:

EZE 20:19  I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments,
 and do them;

EZE 20:20  And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you,
 that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.

EZE 20:21  Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in
 my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he
 shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour
 out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.

EZE 20:22  Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake,
 that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I
 brought them forth.

EZE 20:23  I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would
 scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;

EZE 20:24  Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my
 statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their
 fathers' idols.

EZE 20:25  Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and
 judgments whereby they should not live;

EZE 20:26  And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass
 through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate,
 to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.

EZE 20:27  Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto
 them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me,
 in that they have committed a trespass against me.

EZE 20:28  For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up
 mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the
 thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they
 presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet
 savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.

EZE 20:29  Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And
 the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.

EZE 20:30  Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are
 ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after
 their abominations?

EZE 20:31  For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through
 the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and
 shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord
 GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.

EZE 20:32  And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye
 say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve
 wood and stone.

EZE 20:33  As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a
 stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:

EZE 20:34  And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out
 of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a
 stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.

EZE 20:35  And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there
 will I plead with you face to face.

EZE 20:36  Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of
 Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 20:37  And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you
 into the bond of the covenant:

EZE 20:38  And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that
 transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they
 sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know
 that I am the LORD.

EZE 20:39  As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve
 ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me:
 but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.

EZE 20:40  For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel,
 saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the
 land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your
 offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.

EZE 20:41  I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from
 the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been
 scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.

EZE 20:42  And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into
 the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to
 give it to your fathers.

EZE 20:43  And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein
 ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all
 your evils that ye have committed.

EZE 20:44  And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with you
 for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your
 corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 20:45  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 20:46  Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward
 the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;

EZE 20:47  And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus
 saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour
 every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be
 quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.

EZE 20:48  And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall
 not be quenched.

EZE 20:49  Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak
 parables?

EZE 21:1  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 21:2  Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward
 the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,

EZE 21:3  And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am
 against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut
 off from thee the righteous and the wicked.

EZE 21:4  Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the
 wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh
 from the south to the north:

EZE 21:5  That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out
 of his sheath: it shall not return any more.

EZE 21:6  Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and
 with bitterness sigh before their eyes.

EZE 21:7  And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou?
 that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart
 shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and
 all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to
 pass, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 21:8  Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 21:9  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a
 sword is sharpened, and also furbished:

EZE 21:10  It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it
 may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as
 every tree.

EZE 21:11  And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this
 sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the
 slayer.

EZE 21:12  Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall
 be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be
 upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.

EZE 21:13  Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod?
 it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 21:14  Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands
 together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the
 slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into
 their privy chambers.

EZE 21:15  I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that
 their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright,
 it is wrapped up for the slaughter.

EZE 21:16  Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left,
 whithersoever thy face is set.

EZE 21:17  I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to
 rest: I the LORD have said it.

EZE 21:18  The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

EZE 21:19  Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the
 king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and
 choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.

EZE 21:20  Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
 Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.

EZE 21:21  For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head
 of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted
 with images, he looked in the liver.

EZE 21:22  At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint
 captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with
 shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and
 to build a fort.

EZE 21:23  And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight,
 to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity,
 that they may be taken.

EZE 21:24  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your
 iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so
 that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come
 to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.

EZE 21:25  And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when
 iniquity shall have an end,

EZE 21:26  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown:
 this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is
 high.

EZE 21:27  I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more,
 until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.

EZE 21:28  And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD
 concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The
 sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume
 because of the glittering:

EZE 21:29  Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto
 thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked,
 whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.

EZE 21:30  Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the
 place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.

EZE 21:31  And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against
 thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish
 men, and skilful to destroy.

EZE 21:32  Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst
 of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.

EZE 22:1  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 22:2  Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody
 city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.

EZE 22:3  Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood
 in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself
 to defile herself.

EZE 22:4  Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast
 defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy
 days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made
 thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.

EZE 22:5  Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee,
 which art infamous and much vexed.

EZE 22:6  Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power
 to shed blood.

EZE 22:7  In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst
 of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they
 vexed the fatherless and the widow.

EZE 22:8  Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.

EZE 22:9  In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat
 upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.

EZE 22:10  In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have
 they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.

EZE 22:11  And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and
 another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath
 humbled his sister, his father's daughter.

EZE 22:12  In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury
 and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by
 extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 22:13  Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain
 which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.

EZE 22:14  Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days
 that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.

EZE 22:15  And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the
 countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.

EZE 22:16  And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the
 heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

EZE 22:17  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 22:18  Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are
 brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are
 even the dross of silver.

EZE 22:19  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross,
 behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

EZE 22:20  As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into
 the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I
 gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt
 you.

EZE 22:21  Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my
 wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.

EZE 22:22  As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be
 melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured
 out my fury upon you.

EZE 22:23  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 22:24  Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed,
 nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

EZE 22:25  There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a
 roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the
 treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst
 thereof.

EZE 22:26  Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy
 things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither
 have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid
 their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

EZE 22:27  Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey,
 to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.

EZE 22:28  And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing
 vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when
 the LORD hath not spoken.

EZE 22:29  The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
 robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the
 stranger wrongfully.

EZE 22:30  And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
 hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy
 it: but I found none.

EZE 22:31  Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
 consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed
 upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 23:1  The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

EZE 23:2  Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:

EZE 23:3  And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms
 in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the
 teats of their virginity.

EZE 23:4  And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister:
 and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names;
 Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.

EZE 23:5  And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her
 lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,

EZE 23:6  Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them
 desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.

EZE 23:7  Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were
 the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their
 idols she defiled herself.

EZE 23:8  Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth
 they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured
 their whoredom upon her.

EZE 23:9  Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the
 hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

EZE 23:10  These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her
 daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women;
 for they had executed judgment upon her.

EZE 23:11  And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her
 inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her
 whoredoms.

EZE 23:12  She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers
 clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable
 young men.

EZE 23:13  Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,

EZE 23:14  And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men
 pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with
 vermilion,

EZE 23:15  Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon
 their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the
 Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:

EZE 23:16  And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and
 sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.

EZE 23:17  And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
 defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind
 was alienated from them.

EZE 23:18  So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then
 my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her
 sister.

EZE 23:19  Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days
 of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.

EZE 23:20  For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of
 asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

EZE 23:21  Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in
 bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.

EZE 23:22  Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise
 up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring
 them against thee on every side;

EZE 23:23  The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and
 Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men,
 captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon
 horses.

EZE 23:24  And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels,
 and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and
 shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they
 shall judge thee according to their judgments.

EZE 23:25  And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal
 furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy
 remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters;
 and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.

EZE 23:26  They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy
 fair jewels.

EZE 23:27  Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom
 brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes
 unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.

EZE 23:28  For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the
 hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is
 alienated:

EZE 23:29  And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy
 labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy
 whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.

EZE 23:30  I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring
 after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.

EZE 23:31  Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her
 cup into thine hand.

EZE 23:32  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep
 and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth
 much.

EZE 23:33  Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of
 astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.

EZE 23:34  Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the
 sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith
 the Lord GOD.

EZE 23:35  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten
 me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and
 thy whoredoms.

EZE 23:36  The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah
 and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;

EZE 23:37  That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and
 with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their
 sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour
 them.

EZE 23:38  Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary
 in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.

EZE 23:39  For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they
 came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they
 done in the midst of mine house.

EZE 23:40  And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto
 whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash
 thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,

EZE 23:41  And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it,
 whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.

EZE 23:42  And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the
 men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put
 bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.

EZE 23:43  Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now
 commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?

EZE 23:44  Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth
 the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.

EZE 23:45  And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of
 adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are
 adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.

EZE 23:46  For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon
 them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.

EZE 23:47  And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with
 their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up
 their houses with fire.

EZE 23:48  Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women
 may be taught not to do after your lewdness.

EZE 23:49  And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear
 the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

EZE 24:1  Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the
 month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 24:2  Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day:
 the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.

EZE 24:3  And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them,
 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into
 it:

EZE 24:4  Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the
 thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.

EZE 24:5  Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and
 make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.

EZE 24:6  Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot
 whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out
 piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.

EZE 24:7  For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a
 rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;

EZE 24:8  That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her
 blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.

EZE 24:9  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will
 even make the pile for fire great.

EZE 24:10  Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it
 well, and let the bones be burned.

EZE 24:11  Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may
 be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that
 the scum of it may be consumed.

EZE 24:12  She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not
 forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.

EZE 24:13  In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou
 wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till
 I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.

EZE 24:14  I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it;
 I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to
 thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord
 GOD.

EZE 24:15  Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 24:16  Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes
 with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears
 run down.

EZE 24:17  Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of
 thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy
 lips, and eat not the bread of men.

EZE 24:18  So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died;
 and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

EZE 24:19  And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things
 are to us, that thou doest so?

EZE 24:20  Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 24:21  Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
 will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of
 your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters
 whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.

EZE 24:22  And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor
 eat the bread of men.

EZE 24:23  And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your
 feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your
 iniquities, and mourn one toward another.

EZE 24:24  Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done
 shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

EZE 24:25  Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from
 them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and
 that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,

EZE 24:26  That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause
 thee to hear it with thine ears?

EZE 24:27  In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and
 thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them;
 and they shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 25:1  The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

EZE 25:2  Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against
 them;

EZE 25:3  And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith
 the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was
 profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against
 the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;

EZE 25:4  Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a
 possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their
 dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.

EZE 25:5  And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a
 couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 25:6  For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine hands,
 and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against
 the land of Israel;

EZE 25:7  Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will
 deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the
 people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy
 thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

EZE 25:8  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,
 Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;

EZE 25:9  Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from
 his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country,
 Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,

EZE 25:10  Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in
 possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.

EZE 25:11  And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I
 am the LORD.

EZE 25:12  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the
 house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged
 himself upon them;

EZE 25:13  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand
 upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it
 desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.

EZE 25:14  And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people
 Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my
 fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 25:15  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by
 revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for
 the old hatred;

EZE 25:16  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine
 hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the
 remnant of the sea coast.

EZE 25:17  And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes;
 and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon
 them.

EZE 26:1  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the
 month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 26:2  Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she
 is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be
 replenished, now she is laid waste:

EZE 26:3  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O
 Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea
 causeth his waves to come up.

EZE 26:4  And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers:
 I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.

EZE 26:5  It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the
 sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil
 to the nations.

EZE 26:6  And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword;
 and they shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 26:7  For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses,
 and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.

EZE 26:8  He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall
 make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the
 buckler against thee.

EZE 26:9  And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes
 he shall break down thy towers.

EZE 26:10  By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover
 thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels,
 and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a
 city wherein is made a breach.

EZE 26:11  With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he
 shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down
 to the ground.

EZE 26:12  And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy
 merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant
 houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the
 midst of the water.

EZE 26:13  And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of
 thy harps shall be no more heard.

EZE 26:14  And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place
 to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken
 it, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 26:15  Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the
 sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the
 midst of thee?

EZE 26:16  Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones,
 and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall
 clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall
 tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee.

EZE 26:17  And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How
 art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city,
 which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their
 terror to be on all that haunt it!

EZE 26:18  Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles
 that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.

EZE 26:19  For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city,
 like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon
 thee, and great waters shall cover thee;

EZE 26:20  When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit,
 with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the
 earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that
 thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;

EZE 26:21  I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though thou be
 sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 27:1  The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

EZE 27:2  Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;

EZE 27:3  And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea,
 which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O
 Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect beauty.

EZE 27:4  Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected
 thy beauty.

EZE 27:5  They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have
 taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.

EZE 27:6  Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the
 Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of
 Chittim.

EZE 27:7  Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou
 spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was
 that which covered thee.

EZE 27:8  The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O
 Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.

EZE 27:9  The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy
 calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy
 thy merchandise.

EZE 27:10  They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of
 war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy
 comeliness.

EZE 27:11  The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round
 about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon
 thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.

EZE 27:12  Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of
 riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.

EZE 27:13  Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded the
 persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.

EZE 27:14  They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and
 horsemen and mules.

EZE 27:15  The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the merchandise
 of thine hand: they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony.

EZE 27:16  Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of
 thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered
 work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.

EZE 27:17  Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded
 in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.

EZE 27:18  Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy
 making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white
 wool.

EZE 27:19  Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright
 iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.

EZE 27:20  Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.

EZE 27:21  Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in
 lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants.

EZE 27:22  The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they
 occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious
 stones, and gold.

EZE 27:23  Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and
 Chilmad, were thy merchants.

EZE 27:24  These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue
 clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords,
 and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.

EZE 27:25  The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast
 replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.

EZE 27:26  Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath
 broken thee in the midst of the seas.

EZE 27:27  Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy
 pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of
 war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee,
 shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.

EZE 27:28  The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.

EZE 27:29  And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the
 sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;

EZE 27:30  And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry
 bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow
 themselves in the ashes:

EZE 27:31  And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them
 with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and
 bitter wailing.

EZE 27:32  And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and
 lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the
 midst of the sea?

EZE 27:33  When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many
 people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy
 riches and of thy merchandise.

EZE 27:34  In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths
 of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall
 fall.

EZE 27:35  All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and
 their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their
 countenance.

EZE 27:36  The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a
 terror, and never shalt be any more.

EZE 28:1  The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

EZE 28:2  Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
 Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit
 in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not
 God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:

EZE 28:3  Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can
 hide from thee:

EZE 28:4  With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee
 riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:

EZE 28:5  By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy
 riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:

EZE 28:6  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart
 as the heart of God;

EZE 28:7  Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible
 of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy
 wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.

EZE 28:8  They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths
 of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.

EZE 28:9  Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou
 shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.

EZE 28:10  Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of
 strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 28:11  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 28:12  Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say
 unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of
 wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

EZE 28:13  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was
 thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and
 the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the
 workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day
 that thou wast created.

EZE 28:14  Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so:
 thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the
 midst of the stones of fire.

EZE 28:15  Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created,
 till iniquity was found in thee.

EZE 28:16  By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst
 of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as
 profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering
 cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.

EZE 28:17  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted
 thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I
 will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.

EZE 28:18  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
 iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a
 fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to
 ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.

EZE 28:19  All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at
 thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.

EZE 28:20  Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 28:21  Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,

EZE 28:22  And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O
 Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that
 I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be
 sanctified in her.

EZE 28:23  For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and
 the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on
 every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 28:24  And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of
 Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that
 despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

EZE 28:25  Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of
 Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified
 in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that
 I have given to my servant Jacob.

EZE 28:26  And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and
 plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed
 judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall
 know that I am the LORD their God.

EZE 29:1  In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the
 month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 29:2  Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy
 against him, and against all Egypt:

EZE 29:3  Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee,
 Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his
 rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.

EZE 29:4  But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy
 rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of
 thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.

EZE 29:5  And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the
 fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be
 brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts
 of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.

EZE 29:6  And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD,
 because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

EZE 29:7  When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend
 all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest
 all their loins to be at a stand.

EZE 29:8  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon
 thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.

EZE 29:9  And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall
 know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have
 made it.

EZE 29:10  Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I
 will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of
 Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.

EZE 29:11  No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass
 through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.

EZE 29:12  And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the
 countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid
 waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among
 the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

EZE 29:13  Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather
 the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:

EZE 29:14  And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them
 to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and
 they shall be there a base kingdom.

EZE 29:15  It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt
 itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall
 no more rule over the nations.

EZE 29:16  And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which
 bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but
 they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

EZE 29:17  And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first
 month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me,
 saying,

EZE 29:18  Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve
 a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder
 was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service
 that he had served against it:

EZE 29:19  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of
 Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her
 multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages
 for his army.

EZE 29:20  I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he
 served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 29:21  In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud
 forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them;
 and they shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 30:1  The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

EZE 30:2  Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe
 worth the day!

EZE 30:3  For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day;
 it shall be the time of the heathen.

EZE 30:4  And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in
 Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her
 multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.

EZE 30:5  Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and
 Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the
 sword.

EZE 30:6  Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the
 pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall
 in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 30:7  And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are
 desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.

EZE 30:8  And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in
 Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.

EZE 30:9  In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the
 careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the
 day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.

EZE 30:10  Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to
 cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.

EZE 30:11  He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be
 brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against
 Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

EZE 30:12  And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand
 of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by
 the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.

EZE 30:13  Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will
 cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince
 of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.

EZE 30:14  And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and
 will execute judgments in No.

EZE 30:15  And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will
 cut off the multitude of No.

EZE 30:16  And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No
 shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.

EZE 30:17  The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword: and
 these cities shall go into captivity.

EZE 30:18  At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break
 there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as
 for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.

EZE 30:19  Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I
 am the LORD.

EZE 30:20  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the
 seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 30:21  Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo,
 it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it
 strong to hold the sword.

EZE 30:22  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king
 of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and
 I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.

EZE 30:23  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will
 disperse them through the countries.

EZE 30:24  And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my
 sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before
 him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.

EZE 30:25  But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms
 of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I
 shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch
 it out upon the land of Egypt.

EZE 30:26  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse
 them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 31:1  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the
 first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 31:2  Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude;
 Whom art thou like in thy greatness?

EZE 31:3  Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and
 with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the
 thick boughs.

EZE 31:4  The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her
 rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto all
 the trees of the field.

EZE 31:5  Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
 field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because
 of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.

EZE 31:6  All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his
 branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under
 his shadow dwelt all great nations.

EZE 31:7  Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for
 his root was by great waters.

EZE 31:8  The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees
 were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches;
 nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.

EZE 31:9  I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all
 the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.

EZE 31:10  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up
 thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and
 his heart is lifted up in his height;

EZE 31:11  I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one
 of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his
 wickedness.

EZE 31:12  And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and
 have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are
 fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the
 people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.

EZE 31:13  Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the
 beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:

EZE 31:14  To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves
 for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither
 their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all
 delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the
 children of men, with them that go down to the pit.

EZE 31:15  Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I
 caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods
 thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for
 him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.

EZE 31:16  I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast
 him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of
 Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be
 comforted in the nether parts of the earth.

EZE 31:17  They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with
 the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the
 midst of the heathen.

EZE 31:18  To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees
 of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the
 nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised
 with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,
 saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 32:1  And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the
 first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 32:2  Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say
 unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale
 in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters
 with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.

EZE 32:3  Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee
 with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.

EZE 32:4  Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the
 open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon
 thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.

EZE 32:5  And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys
 with thy height.

EZE 32:6  I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even
 to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.

EZE 32:7  And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the
 stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not
 give her light.

EZE 32:8  All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set
 darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 32:9  I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy
 destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.

EZE 32:10  Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall
 be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and
 they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of
 thy fall.

EZE 32:11  For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall
 come upon thee.

EZE 32:12  By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the
 terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of
 Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.

EZE 32:13  I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great
 waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of
 beasts trouble them.

EZE 32:14  Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run
 like oil, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 32:15  When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall
 be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that
 dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD.

EZE 32:16  This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the
 daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even
 for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 32:17  It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day
 of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 32:18  Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down,
 even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts
 of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.

EZE 32:19  Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the
 uncircumcised.

EZE 32:20  They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword:
 she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.

EZE 32:21  The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of
 hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised,
 slain by the sword.

EZE 32:22  Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him: all
 of them slain, fallen by the sword:

EZE 32:23  Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is
 round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused
 terror in the land of the living.

EZE 32:24  There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all
 of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into
 the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the
 living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.

EZE 32:25  They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
 multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain
 by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet
 have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put
 in the midst of them that be slain.

EZE 32:26  There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round
 about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused
 their terror in the land of the living.

EZE 32:27  And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the
 uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and
 they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be
 upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land
 of the living.

EZE 32:28  Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and
 shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword.

EZE 32:29  There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their
 might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the
 uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.

EZE 32:30  There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the
 Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are
 ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by
 the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.

EZE 32:31  Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his
 multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord
 GOD.

EZE 32:32  For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall
 be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the
 sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 33:1  Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 33:2  Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them,
 When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man
 of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:

EZE 33:3  If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
 trumpet, and warn the people;

EZE 33:4  Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not
 warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his
 own head.

EZE 33:5  He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood
 shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.

EZE 33:6  But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and
 the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among
 them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the
 watchman's hand.

EZE 33:7  So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of
 Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from
 me.

EZE 33:8  When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if
 thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall
 die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.

EZE 33:9  Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if
 he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast
 delivered thy soul.

EZE 33:10  Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus
 ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine
 away in them, how should we then live?

EZE 33:11  Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure
 in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live:
 turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?

EZE 33:12  Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The
 righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his
 transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby
 in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous
 be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.

EZE 33:13  When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he
 trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses
 shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he
 shall die for it.

EZE 33:14  Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn
 from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;

EZE 33:15  If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed,
 walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely
 live, he shall not die.

EZE 33:16  None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him:
 he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.

EZE 33:17  Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not
 equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.

EZE 33:18  When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth
 iniquity, he shall even die thereby.

EZE 33:19  But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is
 lawful and right, he shall live thereby.

EZE 33:20  Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel,
 I will judge you every one after his ways.

EZE 33:21  And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the
 tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of
 Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.

EZE 33:22  Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that
 was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the
 morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.

EZE 33:23  Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 33:24  Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel
 speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many;
 the land is given us for inheritance.

EZE 33:25  Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the
 blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye
 possess the land?

EZE 33:26  Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every
 one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?

EZE 33:27  Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely
 they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the
 open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the
 forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.

EZE 33:28  For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength
 shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall
 pass through.

EZE 33:29  Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land
 most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.

EZE 33:30  Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking
 against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to
 another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is
 the word that cometh forth from the LORD.

EZE 33:31  And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before
 thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for
 with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their
 covetousness.

EZE 33:32  And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a
 pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words,
 but they do them not.

EZE 33:33  And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they
 know that a prophet hath been among them.

EZE 34:1  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 34:2  Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and
 say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the
 shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed
 the flocks?

EZE 34:3  Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that
 are fed: but ye feed not the flock.

EZE 34:4  The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that
 which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have
 ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that
 which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.

EZE 34:5  And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they
 became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.

EZE 34:6  My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high
 hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none
 did search or seek after them.

EZE 34:7  Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

EZE 34:8  As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a
 prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was
 no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds
 fed themselves, and fed not my flock;

EZE 34:9  Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

EZE 34:10  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I
 will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the
 flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will
 deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.

EZE 34:11  For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my
 sheep, and seek them out.

EZE 34:12  As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his
 sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them
 out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.

EZE 34:13  And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the
 countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the
 mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the
 country.

EZE 34:14  I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of
 Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat
 pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.

EZE 34:15  I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the
 Lord GOD.

EZE 34:16  I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was
 driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that
 which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them
 with judgment.

EZE 34:17  And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge
 between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.

EZE 34:18  Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture,
 but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to
 have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?

EZE 34:19  And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your
 feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.

EZE 34:20  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will
 judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.

EZE 34:21  Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all
 the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;

EZE 34:22  Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey;
 and I will judge between cattle and cattle.

EZE 34:23  And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them,
 even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.

EZE 34:24  And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince
 among them; I the LORD have spoken it.

EZE 34:25  And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the
 evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the
 wilderness, and sleep in the woods.

EZE 34:26  And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing;
 and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be
 showers of blessing.

EZE 34:27  And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall
 yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that
 I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them
 out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.

EZE 34:28  And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the
 beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall
 make them afraid.

EZE 34:29  And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no
 more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen
 any more.

EZE 34:30  Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and
 that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 34:31  And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your
 God, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 35:1  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 35:2  Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,

EZE 35:3  And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am
 against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make
 thee most desolate.

EZE 35:4  I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou
 shalt know that I am the LORD.

EZE 35:5  Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood
 of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their
 calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:

EZE 35:6  Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto
 blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even
 blood shall pursue thee.

EZE 35:7  Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him
 that passeth out and him that returneth.

EZE 35:8  And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and
 in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with
 the sword.

EZE 35:9  I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not
 return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 35:10  Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries
 shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:

EZE 35:11  Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according
 to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy
 hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have
 judged thee.

EZE 35:12  And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all
 thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel,
 saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.

EZE 35:13  Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied
 your words against me: I have heard them.

EZE 35:14  Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make
 thee desolate.

EZE 35:15  As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel,
 because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O
 mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the
 LORD.

EZE 36:1  Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and
 say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:

EZE 36:2  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you,
 Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:

EZE 36:3  Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they
 have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be
 a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips
 of talkers, and are an infamy of the people:

EZE 36:4  Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD;
 Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers,
 and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are
 forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that
 are round about;

EZE 36:5  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy
 have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea,
 which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their
 heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.

EZE 36:6  Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the
 mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith
 the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye
 have borne the shame of the heathen:

EZE 36:7  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely
 the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame.

EZE 36:8  But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your
 branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand
 to come.

EZE 36:9  For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be
 tilled and sown:

EZE 36:10  And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all
 of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:

EZE 36:11  And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase
 and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do
 better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the
 LORD.

EZE 36:12  Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and
 they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt
 no more henceforth bereave them of men.

EZE 36:13  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land
 devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations:

EZE 36:14  Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations
 any more, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 36:15  Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen
 any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more,
 neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 36:16  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 36:17  Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they
 defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as
 the uncleanness of a removed woman.

EZE 36:18  Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had
 shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it:

EZE 36:19  And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed
 through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I
 judged them.

EZE 36:20  And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they
 profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the
 LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.

EZE 36:21  But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had
 profaned among the heathen, whither they went.

EZE 36:22  Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; I
 do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake,
 which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.

EZE 36:23  And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the
 heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall
 know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in
 you before their eyes.

EZE 36:24  For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of
 all countries, and will bring you into your own land.

EZE 36:25  Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean:
 from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.

EZE 36:26  A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
 you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give
 you an heart of flesh.

EZE 36:27  And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
 statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.

EZE 36:28  And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye
 shall be my people, and I will be your God.

EZE 36:29  I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call
 for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.

EZE 36:30  And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the
 field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.

EZE 36:31  Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were
 not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities
 and for your abominations.

EZE 36:32  Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto
 you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.

EZE 36:33  Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you
 from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and
 the wastes shall be builded.

EZE 36:34  And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
 in the sight of all that passed by.

EZE 36:35  And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the
 garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become
 fenced, and are inhabited.

EZE 36:36  Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the
 LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD
 have spoken it, and I will do it.

EZE 36:37  Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by the
 house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a
 flock.

EZE 36:38  As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts;
 so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know
 that I am the LORD.

EZE 37:1  The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit
 of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of
 bones,

EZE 37:2  And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were
 very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.

EZE 37:3  And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
 answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.

EZE 37:4  Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them,
 O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.

EZE 37:5  Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath
 to enter into you, and ye shall live:

EZE 37:6  And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and
 cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall
 know that I am the LORD.

EZE 37:7  So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a
 noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.

EZE 37:8  And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
 them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.

EZE 37:9  Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of
 man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds,
 O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.

EZE 37:10  So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into
 them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.

EZE 37:11  Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of
 Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are
 cut off for our parts.

EZE 37:12  Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
 Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of
 your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.

EZE 37:13  And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your
 graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,

EZE 37:14  And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place
 you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and
 performed it, saith the LORD.

EZE 37:15  The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

EZE 37:16  Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it,
 For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another
 stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all the
 house of Israel his companions:

EZE 37:17  And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become
 one in thine hand.

EZE 37:18  And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying,
 Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?

EZE 37:19  Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the
 stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel
 his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and
 make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.

EZE 37:20  And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before
 their eyes.

EZE 37:21  And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the
 children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will
 gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:

EZE 37:22  And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of
 Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two
 nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.

EZE 37:23  Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor
 with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I
 will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and
 will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.

EZE 37:24  And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall
 have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my
 statutes, and do them.

EZE 37:25  And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my
 servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even
 they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my
 servant David shall be their prince for ever.

EZE 37:26  Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an
 everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and
 will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.

EZE 37:27  My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and
 they shall be my people.

EZE 37:28  And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when
 my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

EZE 38:1  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

EZE 38:2  Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief
 prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

EZE 38:3  And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O
 Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

EZE 38:4  And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will
 bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them
 clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and
 shields, all of them handling swords:

EZE 38:5  Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and
 helmet:

EZE 38:6  Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north
 quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.

EZE 38:7  Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company
 that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.

EZE 38:8  After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt
 come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out
 of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always
 waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell
 safely all of them.

EZE 38:9  Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud
 to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.

EZE 38:10  Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the
 same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil
 thought:

EZE 38:11  And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I
 will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling
 without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,

EZE 38:12  To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the
 desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered
 out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the
 midst of the land.

EZE 38:13  Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young
 lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou
 gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take
 away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?

EZE 38:14  Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the
 Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou
 not know it?

EZE 38:15  And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and
 many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a
 mighty army:

EZE 38:16  And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to
 cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against
 my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O
 Gog, before their eyes.

EZE 38:17  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old
 time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days
 many years that I would bring thee against them?

EZE 38:18  And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come
 against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in
 my face.

EZE 38:19  For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely
 in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;

EZE 38:20  So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the
 beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and
 all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my
 presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall
 fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.

EZE 38:21  And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains,
 saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother.

EZE 38:22  And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I
 will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are
 with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

EZE 38:23  Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known
 in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 39:1  Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith
 the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech
 and Tubal:

EZE 39:2  And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and
 will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the
 mountains of Israel:

EZE 39:3  And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine
 arrows to fall out of thy right hand.

EZE 39:4  Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy
 bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous
 birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.

EZE 39:5  Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the
 Lord GOD.

EZE 39:6  And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly
 in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

EZE 39:7  So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel;
 and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall
 know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.

EZE 39:8  Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is the
 day whereof I have spoken.

EZE 39:9  And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall
 set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows
 and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them
 with fire seven years:

EZE 39:10  So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down
 any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they
 shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith
 the Lord GOD.

EZE 39:11  And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a
 place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east
 of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall
 they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of
 Hamongog.

EZE 39:12  And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that
 they may cleanse the land.

EZE 39:13  Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be
 to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 39:14  And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing
 through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face
 of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.

EZE 39:15  And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a
 man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried
 it in the valley of Hamongog.

EZE 39:16  And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they
 cleanse the land.

EZE 39:17  And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every
 feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and
 come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for
 you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat
 flesh, and drink blood.

EZE 39:18  Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the
 princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all
 of them fatlings of Bashan.

EZE 39:19  And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be
 drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

EZE 39:20  Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with
 mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 39:21  And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall
 see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.

EZE 39:22  So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from
 that day and forward.

EZE 39:23  And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into
 captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore
 hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so
 fell they all by the sword.

EZE 39:24  According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions
 have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.

EZE 39:25  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the
 captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will
 be jealous for my holy name;

EZE 39:26  After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses
 whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their
 land, and none made them afraid.

EZE 39:27  When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them
 out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many
 nations;

EZE 39:28  Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them
 to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto
 their own land, and have left none of them any more there.

EZE 39:29  Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured
 out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 40:1  In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning
 of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that
 the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon
 me, and brought me thither.

EZE 40:2  In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set
 me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the
 south.

EZE 40:3  And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose
 appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his
 hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.

EZE 40:4  And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and
 hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee;
 for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither:
 declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.

EZE 40:5  And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the
 man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand
 breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the
 height, one reed.

EZE 40:6  Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up
 the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one
 reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.

EZE 40:7  And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and
 between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate
 by the porch of the gate within was one reed.

EZE 40:8  He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.

EZE 40:9  Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts
 thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.

EZE 40:10  And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this
 side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts
 had one measure on this side and on that side.

EZE 40:11  And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits;
 and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

EZE 40:12  The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this
 side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were
 six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.

EZE 40:13  He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the
 roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.

EZE 40:14  He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the
 court round about the gate.

EZE 40:15  And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the
 porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.

EZE 40:16  And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their
 posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows
 were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees.

EZE 40:17  Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were
 chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were
 upon the pavement.

EZE 40:18  And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length
 of the gates was the lower pavement.

EZE 40:19  Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate
 unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and
 northward.

EZE 40:20  And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he
 measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.

EZE 40:21  And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on
 that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the
 measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the
 breadth five and twenty cubits.

EZE 40:22  And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were
 after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up
 unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.

EZE 40:23  And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the
 north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred
 cubits.

EZE 40:24  After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward
 the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according
 to these measures.

EZE 40:25  And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about,
 like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and
 twenty cubits.

EZE 40:26  And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof
 were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on
 that side, upon the posts thereof.

EZE 40:27  And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he
 measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.

EZE 40:28  And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
 measured the south gate according to these measures;

EZE 40:29  And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the
 arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and
 in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and
 twenty cubits broad.

EZE 40:30  And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and
 five cubits broad.

EZE 40:31  And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees
 were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.

EZE 40:32  And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he
 measured the gate according to these measures.

EZE 40:33  And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the
 arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were windows
 therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and
 five and twenty cubits broad.

EZE 40:34  And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees
 were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up
 to it had eight steps.

EZE 40:35  And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according
 to these measures;

EZE 40:36  The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches
 thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and
 the breadth five and twenty cubits.

EZE 40:37  And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees
 were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up
 to it had eight steps.

EZE 40:38  And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the
 gates, where they washed the burnt offering.

EZE 40:39  And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two
 tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering
 and the trespass offering.

EZE 40:40  And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north
 gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the
 gate, were two tables.

EZE 40:41  Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the
 side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.

EZE 40:42  And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a
 cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high:
 whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt
 offering and the sacrifice.

EZE 40:43  And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon
 the tables was the flesh of the offering.

EZE 40:44  And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the
 inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was
 toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward
 the north.

EZE 40:45  And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the
 south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.

EZE 40:46  And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
 priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok
 among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.

EZE 40:47  So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred
 cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.

EZE 40:48  And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post
 of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the
 breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that
 side.

EZE 40:49  The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven
 cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there
 were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

EZE 41:1  Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six
 cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which
 was the breadth of the tabernacle.

EZE 41:2  And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door
 were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he
 measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.

EZE 41:3  Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits;
 and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.

EZE 41:4  So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth,
 twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy
 place.

EZE 41:5  After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth
 of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.

EZE 41:6  And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in
 order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side
 chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the
 wall of the house.

EZE 41:7  And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the
 side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round
 about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so
 increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.

EZE 41:8  I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations
 of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.

EZE 41:9  The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without,
 was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers
 that were within.

EZE 41:10  And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round
 about the house on every side.

EZE 41:11  And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was
 left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the
 breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.

EZE 41:12  Now the building that was before the separate place at the end
 toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was
 five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.

EZE 41:13  So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate
 place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;

EZE 41:14  Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place
 toward the east, an hundred cubits.

EZE 41:15  And he measured the length of the building over against the separate
 place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on
 the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches
 of the court;

EZE 41:16  The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round
 about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round
 about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;

EZE 41:17  To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and
 by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.

EZE 41:18  And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree
 was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;

EZE 41:19  So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one
 side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it
 was made through all the house round about.

EZE 41:20  From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees
 made, and on the wall of the temple.

EZE 41:21  The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary;
 the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.

EZE 41:22  The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two
 cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls
 thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before
 the LORD.

EZE 41:23  And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

EZE 41:24  And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves
 for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.

EZE 41:25  And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims
 and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks
 upon the face of the porch without.

EZE 41:26  And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on
 the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the
 house, and thick planks.

EZE 42:1  Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the
 north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate
 place, and which was before the building toward the north.

EZE 42:2  Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the
 breadth was fifty cubits.

EZE 42:3  Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and
 over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against
 gallery in three stories.

EZE 42:4  And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward, a
 way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.

EZE 42:5  Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher
 than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.

EZE 42:6  For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars
 of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and
 the middlemost from the ground.

EZE 42:7  And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the
 utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty
 cubits.

EZE 42:8  For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty
 cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.

EZE 42:9  And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one
 goeth into them from the utter court.

EZE 42:10  The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward
 the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.

EZE 42:11  And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers
 which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all
 their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according
 to their doors.

EZE 42:12  And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the
 south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the
 wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.

EZE 42:13  Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers,
 which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests
 that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they
 lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and
 the trespass offering; for the place is holy.

EZE 42:14  When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the
 holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments
 wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments,
 and shall approach to those things which are for the people.

EZE 42:15  Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought
 me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it
 round about.

EZE 42:16  He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred
 reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

EZE 42:17  He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring
 reed round about.

EZE 42:18  He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring
 reed.

EZE 42:19  He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds
 with the measuring reed.

EZE 42:20  He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five
 hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the
 sanctuary and the profane place.

EZE 43:1  Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh
 toward the east:

EZE 43:2  And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the
 east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined
 with his glory.

EZE 43:3  And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,
 even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and
 the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell
 upon my face.

EZE 43:4  And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate
 whose prospect is toward the east.

EZE 43:5  So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and,
 behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.

EZE 43:6  And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood
 by me.

EZE 43:7  And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the
 place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the
 children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no
 more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the
 carcases of their kings in their high places.

EZE 43:8  In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post
 by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy
 name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have
 consumed them in mine anger.

EZE 43:9  Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their
 kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.

EZE 43:10  Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they
 may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.

EZE 43:11  And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the
 form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and
 the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances
 thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it
 in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the
 ordinances thereof, and do them.

EZE 43:12  This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole
 limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the
 house.

EZE 43:13  And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit
 is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the
 breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall
 be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.

EZE 43:14  And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall
 be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even
 to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.

EZE 43:15  So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward
 shall be four horns.

EZE 43:16  And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square
 in the four squares thereof.

EZE 43:17  And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad
 in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit;
 and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look
 toward the east.

EZE 43:18  And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These are
 the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer
 burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.

EZE 43:19  And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed
 of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a
 young bullock for a sin offering.

EZE 43:20  And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four
 horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round
 about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.

EZE 43:21  Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall
 burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.

EZE 43:22  And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without
 blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did
 cleanse it with the bullock.

EZE 43:23  When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young
 bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.

EZE 43:24  And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall
 cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto
 the LORD.

EZE 43:25  Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering:
 they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without
 blemish.

EZE 43:26  Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall
 consecrate themselves.

EZE 43:27  And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth
 day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the
 altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 44:1  Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary
 which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.

EZE 44:2  Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be
 opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel,
 hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.

EZE 44:3  It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread
 before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and
 shall go out by the way of the same.

EZE 44:4  Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I
 looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and
 I fell upon my face.

EZE 44:5  And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with
 thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all
 the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark
 well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.

EZE 44:6  And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel,
 Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your
 abominations,

EZE 44:7  In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in
 heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even
 my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken
 my covenant because of all your abominations.

EZE 44:8  And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set
 keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

EZE 44:9  Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor
 uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that
 is among the children of Israel.

EZE 44:10  And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went
 astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even
 bear their iniquity.

EZE 44:11  Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the
 gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt
 offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them
 to minister unto them.

EZE 44:12  Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the
 house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand
 against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.

EZE 44:13  And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest
 unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place:
 but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have
 committed.

EZE 44:14  But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the
 service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.

EZE 44:15  But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge
 of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall
 come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer
 unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:

EZE 44:16  They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my
 table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.

EZE 44:17  And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates
 of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool
 shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner
 court, and within.

EZE 44:18  They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen
 breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that
 causeth sweat.

EZE 44:19  And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter
 court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they
 ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other
 garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.

EZE 44:20  Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow
 long; they shall only poll their heads.

EZE 44:21  Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner
 court.

EZE 44:22  Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put
 away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a
 widow that had a priest before.

EZE 44:23  And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and
 profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.

EZE 44:24  And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall
 judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my
 statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.

EZE 44:25  And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for
 father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for
 sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.

EZE 44:26  And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.

EZE 44:27  And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner
 court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith
 the Lord GOD.

EZE 44:28  And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their
 inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their
 possession.

EZE 44:29  They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the
 trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.

EZE 44:30  And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every
 oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: ye
 shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause
 the blessing to rest in thine house.

EZE 44:31  The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or
 torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

EZE 45:1  Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye
 shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the
 length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth
 shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round
 about.

EZE 45:2  Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with
 five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for
 the suburbs thereof.

EZE 45:3  And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty
 thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary
 and the most holy place.

EZE 45:4  The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers
 of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: and it
 shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.

EZE 45:5  And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of
 breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for
 themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.

EZE 45:6  And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
 broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the
 holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.

EZE 45:7  And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the
 other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the
 city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession
 of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward:
 and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west
 border unto the east border.

EZE 45:8  In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall
 no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the
 house of Israel according to their tribes.

EZE 45:9  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel:
 remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your
 exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 45:10  Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.

EZE 45:11  The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may
 contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer:
 the measure thereof shall be after the homer.

EZE 45:12  And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and
 twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

EZE 45:13  This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah
 of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an
 homer of barley:

EZE 45:14  Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the
 tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten
 baths are an homer:

EZE 45:15  And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat
 pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for
 peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 45:16  All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince
 in Israel.

EZE 45:17  And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat
 offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and
 in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare
 the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the
 peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

EZE 45:18  Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the
 month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the
 sanctuary:

EZE 45:19  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put
 it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle
 of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.

EZE 45:20  And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that
 erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house.

EZE 45:21  In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall
 have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.

EZE 45:22  And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all
 the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.

EZE 45:23  And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the
 LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and
 a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.

EZE 45:24  And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and
 an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.

EZE 45:25  In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do
 the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering,
 according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and
 according to the oil.

EZE 46:1  Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh
 toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it
 shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.

EZE 46:2  And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate
 without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall
 prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at
 the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be
 shut until the evening.

EZE 46:3  Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this
 gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.

EZE 46:4  And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD
 in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without
 blemish.

EZE 46:5  And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat
 offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an
 ephah.

EZE 46:6  And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without
 blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.

EZE 46:7  And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an
 ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain
 unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

EZE 46:8  And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the
 porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.

EZE 46:9  But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the
 solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship
 shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way
 of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not
 return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over
 against it.

EZE 46:10  And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in;
 and when they go forth, shall go forth.

EZE 46:11  And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be
 an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able
 to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

EZE 46:12  Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or
 peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate
 that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his
 peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and
 after his going forth one shall shut the gate.

EZE 46:13  Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb
 of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.

EZE 46:14  And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the
 sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with
 the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the
 LORD.

EZE 46:15  Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the
 oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.

EZE 46:16  Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his
 sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their
 possession by inheritance.

EZE 46:17  But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his
 servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return
 to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.

EZE 46:18  Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by
 oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his
 sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered
 every man from his possession.

EZE 46:19  After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the
 gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north:
 and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.

EZE 46:20  Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil
 the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat
 offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the
 people.

EZE 46:21  Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass
 by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court
 there was a court.

EZE 46:22  In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty
 cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.

EZE 46:23  And there was a row of building round about in them, round about
 them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.

EZE 46:24  Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where
 the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

EZE 47:1  Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and,
 behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for
 the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down
 from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.

EZE 47:2  Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me
 about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward;
 and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.

EZE 47:3  And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward,
 he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the
 waters were to the ankles.

EZE 47:4  Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the
 waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me
 through; the waters were to the loins.

EZE 47:5  Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not
 pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could
 not be passed over.

EZE 47:6  And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought
 me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.

EZE 47:7  Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very
 many trees on the one side and on the other.

EZE 47:8  Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east
 country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being
 brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.

EZE 47:9  And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which
 moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a
 very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for
 they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.

EZE 47:10  And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from
 Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their
 fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea,
 exceeding many.

EZE 47:11  But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be
 healed; they shall be given to salt.

EZE 47:12  And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that
 side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall
 the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to
 his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the
 fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.

EZE 47:13  Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye shall
 inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have
 two portions.

EZE 47:14  And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the
 which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall
 fall unto you for inheritance.

EZE 47:15  And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from
 the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;

EZE 47:16  Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus
 and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.

EZE 47:17  And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of
 Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the
 north side.

EZE 47:18  And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from
 Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the
 border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.

EZE 47:19  And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of
 strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side
 southward.

EZE 47:20  The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a
 man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.

EZE 47:21  So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of
 Israel.

EZE 47:22  And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an
 inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which
 shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the
 country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you
 among the tribes of Israel.

EZE 47:23  And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger
 sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 48:1  Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the
 coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of
 Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east and
 west; a portion for Dan.

EZE 48:2  And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a
 portion for Asher.

EZE 48:3  And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west
 side, a portion for Naphtali.

EZE 48:4  And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side,
 a portion for Manasseh.

EZE 48:5  And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side,
 a portion for Ephraim.

EZE 48:6  And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west
 side, a portion for Reuben.

EZE 48:7  And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a
 portion for Judah.

EZE 48:8  And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side,
 shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds
 in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side unto
 the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.

EZE 48:9  The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be of five and
 twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth.

EZE 48:10  And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation;
 toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten
 thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward
 the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD
 shall be in the midst thereof.

EZE 48:11  It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of
 Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of
 Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.

EZE 48:12  And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a
 thing most holy by the border of the Levites.

EZE 48:13  And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have
 five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the
 length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.

EZE 48:14  And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the
 firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the LORD.

EZE 48:15  And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the
 five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city, for
 dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof.

EZE 48:16  And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four
 thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five
 hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west
 side four thousand and five hundred.

EZE 48:17  And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred
 and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east
 two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.

EZE 48:18  And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy
 portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it
 shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion; and the increase
 thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city.

EZE 48:19  And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of
 Israel.

EZE 48:20  All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and
 twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the
 possession of the city.

EZE 48:21  And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the
 other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against
 the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and
 westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border,
 over against the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation;
 and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.

EZE 48:22  Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession
 of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the
 border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.

EZE 48:23  As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west
 side, Benjamin shall have a portion.

EZE 48:24  And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west
 side, Simeon shall have a portion.

EZE 48:25  And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side,
 Issachar a portion.

EZE 48:26  And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west
 side, Zebulun a portion.

EZE 48:27  And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side,
 Gad a portion.

EZE 48:28  And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border
 shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the
 river toward the great sea.

EZE 48:29  This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of
 Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith the Lord GOD.

EZE 48:30  And these are the goings out of the city on the north side, four
 thousand and five hundred measures.

EZE 48:31  And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of
 Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one
 gate of Levi.

EZE 48:32  And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three
 gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.

EZE 48:33  And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and
 three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.

EZE 48:34  At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their three
 gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali.

EZE 48:35  It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the
 city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.

HAB 1:1  The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

HAB 1:2  O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out
 unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!

HAB 1:3  Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for
 spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and
 contention.

HAB 1:4  Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for
 the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment
 proceedeth.

HAB 1:5  Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I
 will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though it be told
 you.

HAB 1:6  For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which
 shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces
 that are not their's.

HAB 1:7  They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall
 proceed of themselves.

HAB 1:8  Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce
 than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and
 their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth
 to eat.

HAB 1:9  They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east
 wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.

HAB 1:10  And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn
 unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and
 take it.

HAB 1:11  Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend,
 imputing this his power unto his god.

HAB 1:12  Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall
 not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God,
 thou hast established them for correction.

HAB 1:13  Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on
 iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and
 holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous
 than he?

HAB 1:14  And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that
 have no ruler over them?

HAB 1:15  They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their
 net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.

HAB 1:16  Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their
 drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.

HAB 1:17  Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to
 slay the nations?

HAB 2:1  I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch
 to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.

HAB 2:2  And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it
 plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.

HAB 2:3  For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall
 speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely
 come, it will not tarry.

HAB 2:4  Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the
 just shall live by his faith.

HAB 2:5  Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man, neither
 keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as death, and
 cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him
 all people:

HAB 2:6  Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting
 proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not
 his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!

HAB 2:7  Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that
 shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?

HAB 2:8  Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people
 shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land,
 of the city, and of all that dwell therein.

HAB 2:9  Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he
 may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!

HAB 2:10  Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many
 people, and hast sinned against thy soul.

HAB 2:11  For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the
 timber shall answer it.

HAB 2:12  Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by
 iniquity!

HAB 2:13  Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour
 in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?

HAB 2:14  For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the
 LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

HAB 2:15  Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle
 to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their
 nakedness!

HAB 2:16  Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy
 foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand shall be turned unto
 thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.

HAB 2:17  For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of
 beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence
 of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.

HAB 2:18  What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven
 it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work
 trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?

HAB 2:19  Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise,
 it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no
 breath at all in the midst of it.

HAB 2:20  But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence
 before him.

HAB 3:1  A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

HAB 3:2  O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy
 work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in
 wrath remember mercy.

HAB 3:3  God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His
 glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.

HAB 3:4  And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his
 hand: and there was the hiding of his power.

HAB 3:5  Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his
 feet.

HAB 3:6  He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the
 nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills
 did bow: his ways are everlasting.

HAB 3:7  I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land
 of Midian did tremble.

HAB 3:8  Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against
 the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine
 horses and thy chariots of salvation?

HAB 3:9  Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes,
 even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.

HAB 3:10  The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the
 water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.

HAB 3:11  The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of
 thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.

HAB 3:12  Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh
 the heathen in anger.

HAB 3:13  Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
 salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house
 of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.

HAB 3:14  Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages:
 they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour
 the poor secretly.

HAB 3:15  Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap
 of great waters.

HAB 3:16  When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice:
 rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest
 in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them
 with his troops.

HAB 3:17  Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be
 in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield
 no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd
 in the stalls:

HAB 3:18  Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my
 salvation.

HAB 3:19  The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds'
 feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer
 on my stringed instruments.

HAG 1:1  In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the
 first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto
 Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of
 Josedech, the high priest, saying,

HAG 1:2  Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is
 not come, the time that the LORD's house should be built.

HAG 1:3  Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

HAG 1:4  Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this
 house lie waste?

HAG 1:5  Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

HAG 1:6  Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not
 enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there
 is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag
 with holes.

HAG 1:7  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

HAG 1:8  Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will
 take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.

HAG 1:9  Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye brought it
 home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house
 that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.

HAG 1:10  Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is
 stayed from her fruit.

HAG 1:11  And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and
 upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which
 the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the
 labour of the hands.

HAG 1:12  Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
 Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the
 voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD
 their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.

HAG 1:13  Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message unto the
 people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.

HAG 1:14  And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
 Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of
 Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people;
 and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,

HAG 1:15  In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year
 of Darius the king.

HAG 2:1  In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came
 the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,

HAG 2:2  Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and
 to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the
 people, saying,

HAG 2:3  Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how
 do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?

HAG 2:4  Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O
 Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the
 land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:

HAG 2:5  According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of
 Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.

HAG 2:6  For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and
 I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;

HAG 2:7  And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall
 come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.

HAG 2:8  The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.

HAG 2:9  The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former,
 saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD
 of hosts.

HAG 2:10  In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year
 of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

HAG 2:11  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law,
 saying,

HAG 2:12  If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his
 skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be
 holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

HAG 2:13  Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any
 of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be
 unclean.

HAG 2:14  Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this
 nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and
 that which they offer there is unclean.

HAG 2:15  And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a
 stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:

HAG 2:16  Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty
 measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out
 fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.

HAG 2:17  I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the
 labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.

HAG 2:18  Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth
 day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's
 temple was laid, consider it.

HAG 2:19  Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig
 tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from
 this day will I bless you.

HAG 2:20  And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and
 twentieth day of the month, saying,

HAG 2:21  Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the
 heavens and the earth;

HAG 2:22  And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the
 strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots,
 and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down,
 every one by the sword of his brother.

HAG 2:23  In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel,
 my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a
 signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.

HOS 1:1  The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the
 days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days
 of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.

HOS 1:2  The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to
 Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for
 the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD.

HOS 1:3  So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
 conceived, and bare him a son.

HOS 1:4  And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little
 while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and
 will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.

HOS 1:5  And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of
 Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.

HOS 1:6  And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him,
 Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of
 Israel; but I will utterly take them away.

HOS 1:7  But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by
 the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by
 battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.

HOS 1:8  Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.

HOS 1:9  Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I
 will not be your God.

HOS 1:10  Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the
 sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that
 in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it
 shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.

HOS 1:11  Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be
 gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up
 out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

HOS 2:1  Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.

HOS 2:2  Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I
 her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and
 her adulteries from between her breasts;

HOS 2:3  Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was
 born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her
 with thirst.

HOS 2:4  And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children
 of whoredoms.

HOS 2:5  For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath
 done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my
 bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.

HOS 2:6  Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a
 wall, that she shall not find her paths.

HOS 2:7  And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake
 them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I
 will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than
 now.

HOS 2:8  For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and
 multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.

HOS 2:9  Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
 thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my
 flax given to cover her nakedness.

HOS 2:10  And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and
 none shall deliver her out of mine hand.

HOS 2:11  I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new
 moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

HOS 2:12  And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath
 said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them
 a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.

HOS 2:13  And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned
 incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and
 she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.

HOS 2:14  Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
 wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.

HOS 2:15  And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of
 Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her
 youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.

HOS 2:16  And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me
 Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.

HOS 2:17  For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they
 shall no more be remembered by their name.

HOS 2:18  And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts
 of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things
 of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out
 of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.

HOS 2:19  And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee
 unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in
 mercies.

HOS 2:20  I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know
 the LORD.

HOS 2:21  And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I
 will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;

HOS 2:22  And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and
 they shall hear Jezreel.

HOS 2:23  And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon
 her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my
 people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.

HOS 3:1  Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her
 friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the
 children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.

HOS 3:2  So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer
 of barley, and an half homer of barley:

HOS 3:3  And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not
 play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for
 thee.

HOS 3:4  For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and
 without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without
 an ephod, and without teraphim:

HOS 3:5  Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their
 God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the
 latter days.

HOS 4:1  Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a
 controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor
 mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.

HOS 4:2  By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing
 adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.

HOS 4:3  Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein
 shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven;
 yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.

HOS 4:4  Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they
 that strive with the priest.

HOS 4:5  Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall
 with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.

HOS 4:6  My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast
 rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to
 me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy
 children.

HOS 4:7  As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I
 change their glory into shame.

HOS 4:8  They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their
 iniquity.

HOS 4:9  And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them
 for their ways, and reward them their doings.

HOS 4:10  For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
 whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed
 to the LORD.

HOS 4:11  Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.

HOS 4:12  My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto
 them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone
 a whoring from under their God.

HOS 4:13  They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon
 the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is
 good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall
 commit adultery.

HOS 4:14  I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your
 spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with
 whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not
 understand shall fall.

HOS 4:15  Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and
 come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD
 liveth.

HOS 4:16  For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will
 feed them as a lamb in a large place.

HOS 4:17  Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

HOS 4:18  Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her
 rulers with shame do love, Give ye.

HOS 4:19  The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed
 because of their sacrifices.

HOS 5:1  Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye
 ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a
 snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.

HOS 5:2  And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a
 rebuker of them all.

HOS 5:3  I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim,
 thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.

HOS 5:4  They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the
 spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the
 LORD.

HOS 5:5  And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall
 Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.

HOS 5:6  They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD;
 but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.

HOS 5:7  They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten
 strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.

HOS 5:8  Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at
 Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.

HOS 5:9  Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of
 Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.

HOS 5:10  The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore
 I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.

HOS 5:11  Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly
 walked after the commandment.

HOS 5:12  Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah
 as rottenness.

HOS 5:13  When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went
 Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you,
 nor cure you of your wound.

HOS 5:14  For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the
 house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none
 shall rescue him.

HOS 5:15  I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their
 offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.

HOS 6:1  Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will
 heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

HOS 6:2  After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us
 up, and we shall live in his sight.

HOS 6:3  Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth
 is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the
 latter and former rain unto the earth.

HOS 6:4  O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto
 thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth
 away.

HOS 6:5  Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the
 words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.

HOS 6:6  For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more
 than burnt offerings.

HOS 6:7  But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they
 dealt treacherously against me.

HOS 6:8  Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with
 blood.

HOS 6:9  And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests
 murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.

HOS 6:10  I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the
 whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

HOS 6:11  Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the
 captivity of my people.

HOS 7:1  When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was
 discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the
 thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.

HOS 7:2  And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their
 wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my
 face.

HOS 7:3  They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with
 their lies.

HOS 7:4  They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth
 from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.

HOS 7:5  In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of
 wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

HOS 7:6  For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in
 wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a
 flaming fire.

HOS 7:7  They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their
 kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.

HOS 7:8  Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not
 turned.

HOS 7:9  Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray
 hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.

HOS 7:10  And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not
 return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

HOS 7:11  Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to
 Egypt, they go to Assyria.

HOS 7:12  When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them
 down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation
 hath heard.

HOS 7:13  Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them!
 because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet
 they have spoken lies against me.

HOS 7:14  And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled
 upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel
 against me.

HOS 7:15  Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine
 mischief against me.

HOS 7:16  They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow:
 their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this
 shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.

HOS 8:1  Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the
 house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed
 against my law.

HOS 8:2  Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

HOS 8:3  Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue
 him.

HOS 8:4  They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I
 knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that
 they may be cut off.

HOS 8:5  Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against
 them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?

HOS 8:6  For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not
 God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

HOS 8:7  For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it
 hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers
 shall swallow it up.

HOS 8:8  Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a
 vessel wherein is no pleasure.

HOS 8:9  For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim
 hath hired lovers.

HOS 8:10  Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather
 them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.

HOS 8:11  Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto
 him to sin.

HOS 8:12  I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were
 counted as a strange thing.

HOS 8:13  They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat
 it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and
 visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.

HOS 8:14  For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah
 hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it
 shall devour the palaces thereof.

HOS 9:1  Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a
 whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.

HOS 9:2  The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine
 shall fail in her.

HOS 9:3  They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to
 Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.

HOS 9:4  They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be
 pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of
 mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their
 soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.

HOS 9:5  What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the
 LORD?

HOS 9:6  For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them
 up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles
 shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.

HOS 9:7  The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come;
 Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for
 the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.

HOS 9:8  The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of
 a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.

HOS 9:9  They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah:
 therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.

HOS 9:10  I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as
 the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to
 Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations
 were according as they loved.

HOS 9:11  As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the
 birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.

HOS 9:12  Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that
 there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!

HOS 9:13  Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim
 shall bring forth his children to the murderer.

HOS 9:14  Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb
 and dry breasts.

HOS 9:15  All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the
 wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love
 them no more: all their princes are revolters.

HOS 9:16  Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit:
 yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their
 womb.

HOS 9:17  My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him:
 and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

HOS 10:1  Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:
 according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars;
 according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.

HOS 10:2  Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall
 break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.

HOS 10:3  For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the
 LORD; what then should a king do to us?

HOS 10:4  They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus
 judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.

HOS 10:5  The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of
 Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof
 that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.

HOS 10:6  It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb:
 Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.

HOS 10:7  As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.

HOS 10:8  The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed:
 the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say
 to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.

HOS 10:9  O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood:
 the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.

HOS 10:10  It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall
 be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two
 furrows.

HOS 10:11  And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out
 the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride;
 Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.

HOS 10:12  Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your
 fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain
 righteousness upon you.

HOS 10:13  Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten
 the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of
 thy mighty men.

HOS 10:14  Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy
 fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of
 battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.

HOS 10:15  So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a
 morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

HOS 11:1  When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of
 Egypt.

HOS 11:2  As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto
 Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

HOS 11:3  I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew
 not that I healed them.

HOS 11:4  I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was
 to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto
 them.

HOS 11:5  He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian shall be
 his king, because they refused to return.

HOS 11:6  And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his
 branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.

HOS 11:7  And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called
 them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.

HOS 11:8  How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel?
 how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is
 turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.

HOS 11:9  I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to
 destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst
 of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

HOS 11:10  They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he
 shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.

HOS 11:11  They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the
 land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.

HOS 11:12  Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with
 deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.

HOS 12:1  Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily
 increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the
 Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.

HOS 12:2  The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob
 according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.

HOS 12:3  He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he
 had power with God:

HOS 12:4  Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made
 supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us;

HOS 12:5  Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.

HOS 12:6  Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and wait on
 thy God continually.

HOS 12:7  He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth
 to oppress.

HOS 12:8  And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out
 substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were
 sin.

HOS 12:9  And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make
 thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.

HOS 12:10  I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions,
 and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.

HOS 12:11  Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice
 bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the
 fields.

HOS 12:12  And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a
 wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.

HOS 12:13  And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a
 prophet was he preserved.

HOS 12:14  Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he
 leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD return unto him.

HOS 13:1  When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when
 he offended in Baal, he died.

HOS 13:2  And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images
 of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it
 the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss
 the calves.

HOS 13:3  Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew
 that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the
 floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.

HOS 13:4  Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know
 no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.

HOS 13:5  I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.

HOS 13:6  According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were
 filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.

HOS 13:7  Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will
 I observe them:

HOS 13:8  I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will
 rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the
 wild beast shall tear them.

HOS 13:9  O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.

HOS 13:10  I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all thy
 cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?

HOS 13:11  I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.

HOS 13:12  The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.

HOS 13:13  The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an
 unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of
 children.

HOS 13:14  I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them
 from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy
 destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.

HOS 13:15  Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall
 come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring
 shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the
 treasure of all pleasant vessels.

HOS 13:16  Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her
 God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces,
 and their women with child shall be ripped up.

HOS 14:1  O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine
 iniquity.

HOS 14:2  Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away
 all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our
 lips.

HOS 14:3  Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will
 we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the
 fatherless findeth mercy.

HOS 14:4  I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine
 anger is turned away from him.

HOS 14:5  I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast
 forth his roots as Lebanon.

HOS 14:6  His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive
 tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

HOS 14:7  They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as
 the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of
 Lebanon.

HOS 14:8  Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have
 heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit
 found.

HOS 14:9  Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he
 shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk
 in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.

JER 1:1  The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in
 Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:

JER 1:2  To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of
 Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.

JER 1:3  It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
 unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of
 Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.

JER 1:4  Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

JER 1:5  Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest
 forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto
 the nations.

JER 1:6  Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.

JER 1:7  But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to
 all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.

JER 1:8  Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,
 saith the LORD.

JER 1:9  Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD
 said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.

JER 1:10  See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms,
 to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to
 build, and to plant.

JER 1:11  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what
 seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.

JER 1:12  Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my
 word to perform it.

JER 1:13  And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What
 seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward
 the north.

JER 1:14  Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break
 forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.

JER 1:15  For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,
 saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne
 at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof
 round about, and against all the cities of Judah.

JER 1:16  And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
 wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods,
 and worshipped the works of their own hands.

JER 1:17  Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all
 that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee
 before them.

JER 1:18  For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron
 pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah,
 against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the
 people of the land.

JER 1:19  And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against
 thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.

JER 2:1  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

JER 2:2  Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I
 remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when
 thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.

JER 2:3  Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his
 increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith
 the LORD.

JER 2:4  Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families
 of the house of Israel:

JER 2:5  Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that
 they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?

JER 2:6  Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the
 land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts
 and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a
 land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?

JER 2:7  And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof
 and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made
 mine heritage an abomination.

JER 2:8  The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law
 knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets
 prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.

JER 2:9  Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your
 children's children will I plead.

JER 2:10  For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and
 consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.

JER 2:11  Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my
 people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.

JER 2:12  Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye
 very desolate, saith the LORD.

JER 2:13  For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the
 fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that
 can hold no water.

JER 2:14  Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?

JER 2:15  The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land
 waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.

JER 2:16  Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy
 head.

JER 2:17  Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken
 the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?

JER 2:18  And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters
 of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters
 of the river?

JER 2:19  Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall
 reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter,
 that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee,
 saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

JER 2:20  For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou
 saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every
 green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.

JER 2:21  Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then
 art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?

JER 2:22  For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet
 thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.

JER 2:23  How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim?
 see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift
 dromedary traversing her ways;

JER 2:24  A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her
 pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will
 not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.

JER 2:25  Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but
 thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them
 will I go.

JER 2:26  As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel
 ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their
 prophets.

JER 2:27  Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast
 brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their
 face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.

JER 2:28  But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if
 they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of
 thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.

JER 2:29  Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me,
 saith the LORD.

JER 2:30  In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction:
 your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.

JER 2:31  O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness
 unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we
 will come no more unto thee?

JER 2:32  Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people
 have forgotten me days without number.

JER 2:33  Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also
 taught the wicked ones thy ways.

JER 2:34  Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
 innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.

JER 2:35  Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn
 from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not
 sinned.

JER 2:36  Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be
 ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.

JER 2:37  Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head:
 for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper
 in them.

JER 3:1  They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become
 another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly
 polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again
 to me, saith the LORD.

JER 3:2  Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not
 been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the
 wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy
 wickedness.

JER 3:3  Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no
 latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.

JER 3:4  Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the
 guide of my youth?

JER 3:5  Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end?
 Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.

JER 3:6  The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou
 seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high
 mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.

JER 3:7  And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But
 she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.

JER 3:8  And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel
 committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet
 her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.

JER 3:9  And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she
 defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.

JER 3:10  And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned
 unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.

JER 3:11  And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified
 herself more than treacherous Judah.

JER 3:12  Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou
 backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger to fall
 upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep anger for
 ever.

JER 3:13  Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against
 the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every
 green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.

JER 3:14  Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto
 you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring
 you to Zion:

JER 3:15  And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed
 you with knowledge and understanding.

JER 3:16  And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the
 land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the
 covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they
 remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any
 more.

JER 3:17  At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and
 all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to
 Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their
 evil heart.

JER 3:18  In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of
 Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land
 that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.

JER 3:19  But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a
 pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou
 shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.

JER 3:20  Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye
 dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD.

JER 3:21  A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications
 of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have
 forgotten the LORD their God.

JER 3:22  Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.
 Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God.

JER 3:23  Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the
 multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.

JER 3:24  For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth;
 their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.

JER 3:25  We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have
 sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto
 this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.

JER 4:1  If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if
 thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not
 remove.

JER 4:2  And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in
 righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him
 shall they glory.

JER 4:3  For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up
 your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.

JER 4:4  Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your
 heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth
 like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your
 doings.

JER 4:5  Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the
 trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and
 let us go into the defenced cities.

JER 4:6  Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring
 evil from the north, and a great destruction.

JER 4:7  The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the
 Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land
 desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.

JER 4:8  For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce
 anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.

JER 4:9  And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart
 of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall
 be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.

JER 4:10  Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this
 people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth
 unto the soul.

JER 4:11  At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry
 wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people,
 not to fan, nor to cleanse,

JER 4:12  Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will
 I give sentence against them.

JER 4:13  Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a
 whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are
 spoiled.

JER 4:14  O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be
 saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?

JER 4:15  For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount
 Ephraim.

JER 4:16  Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem,
 that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the
 cities of Judah.

JER 4:17  As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she
 hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.

JER 4:18  Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is
 thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.

JER 4:19  My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a
 noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the
 sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.

JER 4:20  Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled:
 suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.

JER 4:21  How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?

JER 4:22  For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish
 children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to
 do good they have no knowledge.

JER 4:23  I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the
 heavens, and they had no light.

JER 4:24  I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills
 moved lightly.

JER 4:25  I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens
 were fled.

JER 4:26  I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the
 cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his
 fierce anger.

JER 4:27  For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet
 will I not make a full end.

JER 4:28  For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black;
 because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither
 will I turn back from it.

JER 4:29  The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen;
 they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be
 forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.

JER 4:30  And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest
 thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though
 thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair;
 thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.

JER 4:31  For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as
 of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of
 Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me
 now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.

JER 5:1  Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and
 know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be
 any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.

JER 5:2  And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.

JER 5:3  O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them,
 but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to
 receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have
 refused to return.

JER 5:4  Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they
 know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God.

JER 5:5  I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they
 have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God: but these have
 altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.

JER 5:6  Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the
 evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one
 that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions
 are many, and their backslidings are increased.

JER 5:7  How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and
 sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then
 committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots'
 houses.

JER 5:8  They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his
 neighbour's wife.

JER 5:9  Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall not my
 soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

JER 5:10  Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take
 away her battlements; for they are not the LORD's.

JER 5:11  For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very
 treacherously against me, saith the LORD.

JER 5:12  They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil
 come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:

JER 5:13  And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus
 shall it be done unto them.

JER 5:14  Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this
 word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people
 wood, and it shall devour them.

JER 5:15  Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith
 the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose
 language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.

JER 5:16  Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.

JER 5:17  And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons
 and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds:
 they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy
 fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.

JER 5:18  Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full
 end with you.

JER 5:19  And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the
 LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as
 ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve
 strangers in a land that is not your's.

JER 5:20  Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,

JER 5:21  Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which
 have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:

JER 5:22  Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence,
 which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree,
 that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can
 they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?

JER 5:23  But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are
 revolted and gone.

JER 5:24  Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God,
 that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth
 unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.

JER 5:25  Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have
 withholden good things from you.

JER 5:26  For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that
 setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.

JER 5:27  As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit:
 therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.

JER 5:28  They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the
 wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they
 prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.

JER 5:29  Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul
 be avenged on such a nation as this?

JER 5:30  A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;

JER 5:31  The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their
 means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end
 thereof?

JER 6:1  O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst
 of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in
 Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.

JER 6:2  I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.

JER 6:3  The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch
 their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.

JER 6:4  Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto
 us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.

JER 6:5  Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.

JER 6:6  For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a
 mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly
 oppression in the midst of her.

JER 6:7  As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her
 wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is
 grief and wounds.

JER 6:8  Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I
 make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.

JER 6:9  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant
 of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the
 baskets.

JER 6:10  To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?
 behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word
 of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.

JER 6:11  Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding
 in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of
 young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the
 aged with him that is full of days.

JER 6:12  And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and
 wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the
 land, saith the LORD.

JER 6:13  For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one
 is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one
 dealeth falsely.

JER 6:14  They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,
 saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

JER 6:15  Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were
 not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among
 them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith
 the LORD.

JER 6:16  Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the
 old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest
 for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.

JER 6:17  Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the
 trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

JER 6:18  Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among
 them.

JER 6:19  Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the
 fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor
 to my law, but rejected it.

JER 6:20  To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet
 cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your
 sacrifices sweet unto me.

JER 6:21  Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks
 before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon
 them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.

JER 6:22  Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north
 country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.

JER 6:23  They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no
 mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in
 array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.

JER 6:24  We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath
 taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

JER 6:25  Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword
 of the enemy and fear is on every side.

JER 6:26  O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself
 in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation:
 for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.

JER 6:27  I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou
 mayest know and try their way.

JER 6:28  They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are
 brass and iron; they are all corrupters.

JER 6:29  The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder
 melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

JER 6:30  Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath rejected
 them.

JER 7:1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

JER 7:2  Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this
 word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that enter in at
 these gates to worship the LORD.

JER 7:3  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and
 your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.

JER 7:4  Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The
 temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.

JER 7:5  For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly
 execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;

JER 7:6  If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and
 shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your
 hurt:

JER 7:7  Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave
 to your fathers, for ever and ever.

JER 7:8  Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.

JER 7:9  Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and
 burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;

JER 7:10  And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my
 name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?

JER 7:11  Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in
 your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD.

JER 7:12  But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name
 at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people
 Israel.

JER 7:13  And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I
 spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called
 you, but ye answered not;

JER 7:14  Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name,
 wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers,
 as I have done to Shiloh.

JER 7:15  And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your
 brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.

JER 7:16  Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor
 prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.

JER 7:17  Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets
 of Jerusalem?

JER 7:18  The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the
 women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour
 out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.

JER 7:19  Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke
 themselves to the confusion of their own faces?

JER 7:20  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my fury
 shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the
 trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and
 shall not be quenched.

JER 7:21  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt
 offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.

JER 7:22  For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that
 I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or
 sacrifices:

JER 7:23  But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be
 your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have
 commanded you, that it may be well unto you.

JER 7:24  But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the
 counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and
 not forward.

JER 7:25  Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt
 unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily
 rising up early and sending them:

JER 7:26  Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened
 their neck: they did worse than their fathers.

JER 7:27  Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will
 not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer
 thee.

JER 7:28  But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the
 voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and
 is cut off from their mouth.

JER 7:29  Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a
 lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the
 generation of his wrath.

JER 7:30  For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD:
 they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to
 pollute it.

JER 7:31  And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley
 of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire;
 which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.

JER 7:32  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no
 more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of
 slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.

JER 7:33  And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the
 heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.

JER 7:34  Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the
 streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the
 voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be
 desolate.

JER 8:1  At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the
 kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests,
 and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
 out of their graves:

JER 8:2  And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the
 host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after
 whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have
 worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung
 upon the face of the earth.

JER 8:3  And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them
 that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I
 have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.

JER 8:4  Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they
 fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?

JER 8:5  Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual
 backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.

JER 8:6  I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him
 of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course,
 as the horse rusheth into the battle.

JER 8:7  Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the
 turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my
 people know not the judgment of the LORD.

JER 8:8  How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo,
 certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.

JER 8:9  The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have
 rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?

JER 8:10  Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields
 to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the
 greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest
 every one dealeth falsely.

JER 8:11  For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,
 saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

JER 8:12  Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were
 not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among
 them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down,
 saith the LORD.

JER 8:13  I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes
 on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the
 things that I have given them shall pass away from them.

JER 8:14  Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the
 defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us
 to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned
 against the LORD.

JER 8:15  We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and
 behold trouble!

JER 8:16  The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land
 trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are
 come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those
 that dwell therein.

JER 8:17  For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will
 not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.

JER 8:18  When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.

JER 8:19  Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because
 of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king
 in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with
 strange vanities?

JER 8:20  The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.

JER 8:21  For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black;
 astonishment hath taken hold on me.

JER 8:22  Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is
 not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?

JER 9:1  Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I
 might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!

JER 9:2  Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that
 I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an
 assembly of treacherous men.

JER 9:3  And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not
 valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and
 they know not me, saith the LORD.

JER 9:4  Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any
 brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will
 walk with slanders.

JER 9:5  And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the
 truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to
 commit iniquity.

JER 9:6  Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse
 to know me, saith the LORD.

JER 9:7  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and
 try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?

JER 9:8  Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh
 peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.

JER 9:9  Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my
 soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

JER 9:10  For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the
 habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so
 that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the
 cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.

JER 9:11  And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will
 make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.

JER 9:12  Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom
 the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land
 perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?

JER 9:13  And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set
 before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;

JER 9:14  But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after
 Baalim, which their fathers taught them:

JER 9:15  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
 will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall
 to drink.

JER 9:16  I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor
 their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have
 consumed them.

JER 9:17  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning
 women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:

JER 9:18  And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes
 may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.

JER 9:19  For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we
 are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our
 dwellings have cast us out.

JER 9:20  Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive
 the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her
 neighbour lamentation.

JER 9:21  For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our
 palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the
 streets.

JER 9:22  Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as
 dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none
 shall gather them.

JER 9:23  Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
 neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in
 his riches:

JER 9:24  But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and
 knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and
 righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD.

JER 9:25  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them
 which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;

JER 9:26  Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and
 all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all
 these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are
 uncircumcised in the heart.

JER 10:1  Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:

JER 10:2  Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not
 dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.

JER 10:3  For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out
 of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.

JER 10:4  They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and
 with hammers, that it move not.

JER 10:5  They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be
 borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do
 evil, neither also is it in them to do good.

JER 10:6  Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art
 great, and thy name is great in might.

JER 10:7  Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it
 appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all
 their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.

JER 10:8  But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine
 of vanities.

JER 10:9  Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from
 Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and
 purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.

JER 10:10  But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an
 everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall
 not be able to abide his indignation.

JER 10:11  Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens
 and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these
 heavens.

JER 10:12  He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world
 by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.

JER 10:13  When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the
 heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he
 maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his
 treasures.

JER 10:14  Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded
 by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no
 breath in them.

JER 10:15  They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their
 visitation they shall perish.

JER 10:16  The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all
 things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his
 name.

JER 10:17  Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.

JER 10:18  For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants
 of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.

JER 10:19  Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this
 is a grief, and I must bear it.

JER 10:20  My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children
 are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my
 tent any more, and to set up my curtains.

JER 10:21  For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD:
 therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.

JER 10:22  Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out
 of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of
 dragons.

JER 10:23  O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in
 man that walketh to direct his steps.

JER 10:24  O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou
 bring me to nothing.

JER 10:25  Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the
 families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and
 devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.

JER 11:1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,

JER 11:2  Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of
 Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;

JER 11:3  And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be
 the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,

JER 11:4  Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth
 out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and
 do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and
 I will be your God:

JER 11:5  That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to
 give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then
 answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.

JER 11:6  Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of
 Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this
 covenant, and do them.

JER 11:7  For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought
 them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and
 protesting, saying, Obey my voice.

JER 11:8  Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one
 in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all
 the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do: but they did them
 not.

JER 11:9  And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of
 Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

JER 11:10  They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which
 refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the
 house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made
 with their fathers.

JER 11:11  Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them,
 which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I
 will not hearken unto them.

JER 11:12  Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and
 cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them
 at all in the time of their trouble.

JER 11:13  For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah;
 and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars
 to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.

JER 11:14  Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or
 prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me
 for their trouble.

JER 11:15  What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought
 lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest
 evil, then thou rejoicest.

JER 11:16  The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly
 fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the
 branches of it are broken.

JER 11:17  For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil
 against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah,
 which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering
 incense unto Baal.

JER 11:18  And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou
 shewedst me their doings.

JER 11:19  But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and
 I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy
 the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the
 living, that his name may be no more remembered.

JER 11:20  But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the
 reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I
 revealed my cause.

JER 11:21  Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy
 life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our
 hand:

JER 11:22  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them:
 the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall
 die by famine:

JER 11:23  And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon
 the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.

JER 12:1  Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk
 with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?
 wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?

JER 12:2  Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow,
 yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their
 reins.

JER 12:3  But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart
 toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for
 the day of slaughter.

JER 12:4  How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither,
 for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and
 the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.

JER 12:5  If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then
 how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou
 trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of
 Jordan?

JER 12:6  For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have
 dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee:
 believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.

JER 12:7  I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given
 the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.

JER 12:8  Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out
 against me: therefore have I hated it.

JER 12:9  Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about
 are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to
 devour.

JER 12:10  Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my
 portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.

JER 12:11  They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me;
 the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.

JER 12:12  The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness:
 for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even
 to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.

JER 12:13  They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put
 themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your
 revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.

JER 12:14  Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the
 inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will
 pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among
 them.

JER 12:15  And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will
 return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to
 his heritage, and every man to his land.

JER 12:16  And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of
 my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to
 swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.

JER 12:17  But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that
 nation, saith the LORD.

JER 13:1  Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put
 it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.

JER 13:2  So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my
 loins.

JER 13:3  And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,

JER 13:4  Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and
 arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.

JER 13:5  So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.

JER 13:6  And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me,
 Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded
 thee to hide there.

JER 13:7  Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the
 place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was
 profitable for nothing.

JER 13:8  Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

JER 13:9  Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of
 Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.

JER 13:10  This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the
 imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to
 worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.

JER 13:11  For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused
 to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah,
 saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and
 for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.

JER 13:12  Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD
 God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say
 unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with
 wine?

JER 13:13  Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will
 fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's
 throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of
 Jerusalem, with drunkenness.

JER 13:14  And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the
 sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy,
 but destroy them.

JER 13:15  Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.

JER 13:16  Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and
 before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for
 light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.

JER 13:17  But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for
 your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because
 the LORD's flock is carried away captive.

JER 13:18  Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for
 your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.

JER 13:19  The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them:
 Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried
 away captive.

JER 13:20  Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where
 is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?

JER 13:21  What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught
 them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as
 a woman in travail?

JER 13:22  And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me?
 For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels
 made bare.

JER 13:23  Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then
 may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.

JER 13:24  Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by
 the wind of the wilderness.

JER 13:25  This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the
 LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.

JER 13:26  Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame
 may appear.

JER 13:27  I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy
 whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O
 Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?

JER 14:1  The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.

JER 14:2  Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto
 the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.

JER 14:3  And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came
 to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they
 were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.

JER 14:4  Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the
 plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.

JER 14:5  Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there
 was no grass.

JER 14:6  And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the
 wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass.

JER 14:7  O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy
 name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.

JER 14:8  O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why
 shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that
 turneth aside to tarry for a night?

JER 14:9  Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot
 save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy
 name; leave us not.

JER 14:10  Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to
 wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not
 accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.

JER 14:11  Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.

JER 14:12  When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt
 offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by
 the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.

JER 14:13  Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye
 shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you
 assured peace in this place.

JER 14:14  Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I
 sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they
 prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and
 the deceit of their heart.

JER 14:15  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy
 in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be
 in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.

JER 14:16  And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
 streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have
 none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters:
 for I will pour their wickedness upon them.

JER 14:17  Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down
 with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of
 my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.

JER 14:18  If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword!
 and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine!
 yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.

JER 14:19  Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why
 hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for
 peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!

JER 14:20  We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our
 fathers: for we have sinned against thee.

JER 14:21  Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of
 thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.

JER 14:22  Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause
 rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God?
 therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these things.

JER 15:1  Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me,
 yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and
 let them go forth.

JER 15:2  And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go
 forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death,
 to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for
 the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the
 captivity.

JER 15:3  And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to
 slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts
 of the earth, to devour and destroy.

JER 15:4  And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth,
 because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did
 in Jerusalem.

JER 15:5  For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan
 thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?

JER 15:6  Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward:
 therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am
 weary with repenting.

JER 15:7  And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will
 bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return not from
 their ways.

JER 15:8  Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have
 brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I
 have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.

JER 15:9  She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost;
 her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and
 confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their
 enemies, saith the LORD.

JER 15:10  Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a
 man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men
 have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.

JER 15:11  The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I
 will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time
 of affliction.

JER 15:12  Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?

JER 15:13  Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without
 price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.

JER 15:14  And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which
 thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon
 you.

JER 15:15  O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of
 my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake
 I have suffered rebuke.

JER 15:16  Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me
 the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God
 of hosts.

JER 15:17  I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone
 because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.

JER 15:18  Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to
 be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that
 fail?

JER 15:19  Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring
 thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the
 precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee;
 but return not thou unto them.

JER 15:20  And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they
 shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am
 with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.

JER 15:21  And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will
 redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.

JER 16:1  The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,

JER 16:2  Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or
 daughters in this place.

JER 16:3  For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
 daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare
 them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;

JER 16:4  They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented;
 neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the
 earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their
 carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the
 earth.

JER 16:5  For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning,
 neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from
 this people, saith the LORD, even lovingkindness and mercies.

JER 16:6  Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not
 be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make
 themselves bald for them:

JER 16:7  Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort
 them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to
 drink for their father or for their mother.

JER 16:8  Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them
 to eat and to drink.

JER 16:9  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will
 cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of
 mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice
 of the bride.

JER 16:10  And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all
 these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced
 all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin
 that we have committed against the LORD our God?

JER 16:11  Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken
 me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served
 them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my
 law;

JER 16:12  And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every
 one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto
 me:

JER 16:13  Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know
 not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and
 night; where I will not shew you favour.

JER 16:14  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no
 more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out
 of the land of Egypt;

JER 16:15  But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from
 the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and
 I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.

JER 16:16  Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall
 fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them
 from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.

JER 16:17  For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my
 face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.

JER 16:18  And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double;
 because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the
 carcases of their detestable and abominable things.

JER 16:19  O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of
 affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and
 shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein
 there is no profit.

JER 16:20  Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?

JER 16:21  Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause
 them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is The
 LORD.

JER 17:1  The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of
 a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of
 your altars;

JER 17:2  Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the
 green trees upon the high hills.

JER 17:3  O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy
 treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout all thy
 borders.

JER 17:4  And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I
 gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which
 thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn
 for ever.

JER 17:5  Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and
 maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.

JER 17:6  For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when
 good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a
 salt land and not inhabited.

JER 17:7  Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD
 is.

JER 17:8  For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth
 out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf
 shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither
 shall cease from yielding fruit.

JER 17:9  The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who
 can know it?

JER 17:10  I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man
 according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.

JER 17:11  As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that
 getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days,
 and at his end shall be a fool.

JER 17:12  A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our
 sanctuary.

JER 17:13  O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be
 ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because
 they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.

JER 17:14  Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be
 saved: for thou art my praise.

JER 17:15  Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come
 now.

JER 17:16  As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee:
 neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of
 my lips was right before thee.

JER 17:17  Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.

JER 17:18  Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be
 confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them
 the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.

JER 17:19  Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children
 of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go
 out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;

JER 17:20  And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of
 Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by
 these gates:

JER 17:21  Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on
 the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;

JER 17:22  Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day,
 neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your
 fathers.

JER 17:23  But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck
 stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.

JER 17:24  And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith
 the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath
 day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;

JER 17:25  Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes
 sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and
 their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this
 city shall remain for ever.

JER 17:26  And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places
 about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from
 the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices,
 and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the
 house of the LORD.

JER 17:27  But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and
 not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the
 sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall
 devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

JER 18:1  The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

JER 18:2  Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee
 to hear my words.

JER 18:3  Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a
 work on the wheels.

JER 18:4  And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the
 potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to
 make it.

JER 18:5  Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

JER 18:6  O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the
 LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O
 house of Israel.

JER 18:7  At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a
 kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;

JER 18:8  If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil,
 I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.

JER 18:9  And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning
 a kingdom, to build and to plant it;

JER 18:10  If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will
 repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.

JER 18:11  Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil
 against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from
 his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.

JER 18:12  And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own
 devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.

JER 18:13  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who
 hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.

JER 18:14  Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock
 of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place
 be forsaken?

JER 18:15  Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to
 vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient
 paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;

JER 18:16  To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that
 passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.

JER 18:17  I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will
 shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.

JER 18:18  Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for
 the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the
 word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us
 not give heed to any of his words.

JER 18:19  Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that
 contend with me.

JER 18:20  Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for
 my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to
 turn away thy wrath from them.

JER 18:21  Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out
 their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved
 of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let
 their young men be slain by the sword in battle.

JER 18:22  Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop
 suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for
 my feet.

JER 18:23  Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me:
 forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but
 let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine
 anger.

JER 19:1  Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take
 of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;

JER 19:2  And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the
 entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,

JER 19:3  And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and
 inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
 Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his
 ears shall tingle.

JER 19:4  Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and
 have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their
 fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with
 the blood of innocents;

JER 19:5  They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with
 fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it,
 neither came it into my mind:

JER 19:6  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place
 shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The
 valley of slaughter.

JER 19:7  And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this
 place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and
 by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to
 be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

JER 19:8  And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that
 passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues
 thereof.

JER 19:9  And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh
 of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend
 in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek
 their lives, shall straiten them.

JER 19:10  Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go
 with thee,

JER 19:11  And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will
 I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that
 cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be
 no place to bury.

JER 19:12  Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the
 inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet:

JER 19:13  And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah,
 shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose
 roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured
 out drink offerings unto other gods.

JER 19:14  Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to
 prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house; and said to all the
 people,

JER 19:15  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will
 bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have
 pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they
 might not hear my words.

JER 20:1  Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor
 in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.

JER 20:2  Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks
 that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.

JER 20:3  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah
 out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy
 name Pashur, but Magormissabib.

JER 20:4  For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to
 thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their
 enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the
 hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into
 Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.

JER 20:5  Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the
 labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures
 of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall
 spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.

JER 20:6  And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into
 captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and
 shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast
 prophesied lies.

JER 20:7  O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art stronger
 than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.

JER 20:8  For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because
 the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.

JER 20:9  Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in
 his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my
 bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.

JER 20:10  For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say
 they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying,
 Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we
 shall take our revenge on him.

JER 20:11  But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my
 persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly
 ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never
 be forgotten.

JER 20:12  But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins
 and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened
 my cause.

JER 20:13  Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the
 soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.

JER 20:14  Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my
 mother bare me be blessed.

JER 20:15  Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man
 child is born unto thee; making him very glad.

JER 20:16  And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and
 repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at
 noontide;

JER 20:17  Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have
 been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.

JER 20:18  Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow,
 that my days should be consumed with shame?

JER 21:1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah
 sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah
 the priest, saying,

JER 21:2  Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of
 Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us
 according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.

JER 21:3  Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:

JER 21:4  Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the
 weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of
 Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and
 I will assemble them into the midst of this city.

JER 21:5  And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and
 with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.

JER 21:6  And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast:
 they shall die of a great pestilence.

JER 21:7  And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of
 Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city
 from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into
 the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge
 of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.

JER 21:8  And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I
 set before you the way of life, and the way of death.

JER 21:9  He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the
 famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the
 Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for
 a prey.

JER 21:10  For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good,
 saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and
 he shall burn it with fire.

JER 21:11  And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word
 of the LORD;

JER 21:12  O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the
 morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor,
 lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because
 of the evil of your doings.

JER 21:13  Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock
 of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or
 who shall enter into our habitations?

JER 21:14  But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith
 the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour
 all things round about it.

JER 22:1  Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and
 speak there this word,

JER 22:2  And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest
 upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter
 in by these gates:

JER 22:3  Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and
 deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no
 violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed
 innocent blood in this place.

JER 22:4  For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the
 gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in
 chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.

JER 22:5  But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the
 LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.

JER 22:6  For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; Thou art
 Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a
 wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.

JER 22:7  And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his
 weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the
 fire.

JER 22:8  And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every
 man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city?

JER 22:9  Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant
 of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.

JER 22:10  Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him
 that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.

JER 22:11  For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of
 Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of
 this place; He shall not return thither any more:

JER 22:12  But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and
 shall see this land no more.

JER 22:13  Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his
 chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and
 giveth him not for his work;

JER 22:14  That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and
 cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and painted with
 vermilion.

JER 22:15  Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy
 father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with
 him?

JER 22:16  He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with
 him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD.

JER 22:17  But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and
 for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.

JER 22:18  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
 king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah
 sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!

JER 22:19  He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth
 beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

JER 22:20  Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry
 from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.

JER 22:21  I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not
 hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my
 voice.

JER 22:22  The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into
 captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy
 wickedness.

JER 22:23  O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how
 gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in
 travail!

JER 22:24  As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king
 of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;

JER 22:25  And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and
 into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.

JER 22:26  And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into
 another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.

JER 22:27  But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they
 not return.

JER 22:28  Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is
 no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into
 a land which they know not?

JER 22:29  O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.

JER 22:30  Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall
 not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon
 the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.

JER 23:1  Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my
 pasture! saith the LORD.

JER 23:2  Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that
 feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have
 not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings,
 saith the LORD.

JER 23:3  And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
 whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and
 they shall be fruitful and increase.

JER 23:4  And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they
 shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the
 LORD.

JER 23:5  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a
 righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute
 judgment and justice in the earth.

JER 23:6  In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and
 this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.

JER 23:7  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no
 more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the
 land of Egypt;

JER 23:8  But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the
 house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I
 had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.

JER 23:9  Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones
 shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome,
 because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.

JER 23:10  For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land
 mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their
 course is evil, and their force is not right.

JER 23:11  For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I
 found their wickedness, saith the LORD.

JER 23:12  Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the
 darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil
 upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.

JER 23:13  And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in
 Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.

JER 23:14  I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing:
 they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of
 evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness; they are all of them
 unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.

JER 23:15  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets;
 Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of
 gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all
 the land.

JER 23:16  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the
 prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision
 of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD.

JER 23:17  They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye
 shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the
 imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.

JER 23:18  For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived
 and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?

JER 23:19  Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a
 grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.

JER 23:20  The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and
 till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall
 consider it perfectly.

JER 23:21  I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken
 to them, yet they prophesied.

JER 23:22  But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to
 hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and
 from the evil of their doings.

JER 23:23  Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?

JER 23:24  Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?
 saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.

JER 23:25  I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name,
 saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.

JER 23:26  How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy
 lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;

JER 23:27  Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams
 which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten
 my name for Baal.

JER 23:28  The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that
 hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the
 wheat? saith the LORD.

JER 23:29  Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer
 that breaketh the rock in pieces?

JER 23:30  Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that
 steal my words every one from his neighbour.

JER 23:31  Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their
 tongues, and say, He saith.

JER 23:32  Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the
 LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by
 their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they
 shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.

JER 23:33  And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee,
 saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What
 burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.

JER 23:34  And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall
 say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.

JER 23:35  Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his
 brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?

JER 23:36  And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's
 word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God,
 of the LORD of hosts our God.

JER 23:37  Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered
 thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?

JER 23:38  But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the
 LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto
 you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD;

JER 23:39  Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will
 forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out
 of my presence:

JER 23:40  And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual
 shame, which shall not be forgotten.

JER 24:1  The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before
 the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried
 away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of
 Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them
 to Babylon.

JER 24:2  One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first
 ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be
 eaten, they were so bad.

JER 24:3  Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said,
 Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be
 eaten, they are so evil.

JER 24:4  Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

JER 24:5  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will
 I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent
 out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.

JER 24:6  For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them
 again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will
 plant them, and not pluck them up.

JER 24:7  And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and
 they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto
 me with their whole heart.

JER 24:8  And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely
 thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his
 princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them
 that dwell in the land of Egypt:

JER 24:9  And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the
 earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in
 all places whither I shall drive them.

JER 24:10  And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among
 them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and
 to their fathers.

JER 25:1  The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah
 in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the
 first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;

JER 25:2  The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of
 Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,

JER 25:3  From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah,
 even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the
 LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and
 speaking; but ye have not hearkened.

JER 25:4  And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising
 early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to
 hear.

JER 25:5  They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from
 the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto
 you and to your fathers for ever and ever:

JER 25:6  And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and
 provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no
 hurt.

JER 25:7  Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might
 provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.

JER 25:8  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my
 words,

JER 25:9  Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the
 LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them
 against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these
 nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an
 astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.

JER 25:10  Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of
 gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound
 of the millstones, and the light of the candle.

JER 25:11  And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and
 these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.

JER 25:12  And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that
 I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their
 iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual
 desolations.

JER 25:13  And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced
 against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath
 prophesied against all the nations.

JER 25:14  For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them
 also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according
 to the works of their own hands.

JER 25:15  For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of
 this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to
 drink it.

JER 25:16  And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword
 that I will send among them.

JER 25:17  Then took I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to
 drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:

JER 25:18  To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings
 thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment,
 an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;

JER 25:19  Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all
 his people;

JER 25:20  And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and
 all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and
 Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,

JER 25:21  Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,

JER 25:22  And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the
 kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,

JER 25:23  Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,

JER 25:24  And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people
 that dwell in the desert,

JER 25:25  And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the
 kings of the Medes,

JER 25:26  And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and
 all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the
 king of Sheshach shall drink after them.

JER 25:27  Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
 the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no
 more, because of the sword which I will send among you.

JER 25:28  And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to
 drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall
 certainly drink.

JER 25:29  For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my
 name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I
 will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD
 of hosts.

JER 25:30  Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto
 them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy
 habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a
 shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the
 earth.

JER 25:31  A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath
 a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give
 them that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD.

JER 25:32  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from
 nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts
 of the earth.

JER 25:33  And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the
 earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented,
 neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.

JER 25:34  Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye
 principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your
 dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.

JER 25:35  And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal
 of the flock to escape.

JER 25:36  A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal
 of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture.

JER 25:37  And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce
 anger of the LORD.

JER 25:38  He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate
 because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.

JER 26:1  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
 Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,

JER 26:2  Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and
 speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD's
 house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a
 word:

JER 26:3  If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way,
 that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because
 of the evil of their doings.

JER 26:4  And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not
 hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,

JER 26:5  To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto
 you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;

JER 26:6  Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a
 curse to all the nations of the earth.

JER 26:7  So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
 speaking these words in the house of the LORD.

JER 26:8  Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all
 that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the
 priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt
 surely die.

JER 26:9  Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house
 shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant?
 And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.

JER 26:10  When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from
 the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the
 new gate of the LORD's house.

JER 26:11  Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all
 the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against
 this city, as ye have heard with your ears.

JER 26:12  Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people,
 saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city
 all the words that ye have heard.

JER 26:13  Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice
 of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath
 pronounced against you.

JER 26:14  As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and
 meet unto you.

JER 26:15  But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely
 bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the
 inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak
 all these words in your ears.

JER 26:16  Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the
 prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name
 of the LORD our God.

JER 26:17  Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the
 assembly of the people, saying,

JER 26:18  Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of
 Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of
 hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps,
 and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.

JER 26:19  Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death?
 did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him
 of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great
 evil against our souls.

JER 26:20  And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD,
 Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city
 and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.

JER 26:21  And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the
 princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when
 Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;

JER 26:22  And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son
 of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.

JER 26:23  And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto
 Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into
 the graves of the common people.

JER 26:24  Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with
 Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put
 him to death.

JER 27:1  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
 Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

JER 27:2  Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them
 upon thy neck,

JER 27:3  And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and
 to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of
 Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah
 king of Judah;

JER 27:4  And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of
 hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;

JER 27:5  I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the
 ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto
 whom it seemed meet unto me.

JER 27:6  And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
 the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him
 also to serve him.

JER 27:7  And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son,
 until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings
 shall serve themselves of him.

JER 27:8  And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not
 serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put
 their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish,
 saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence,
 until I have consumed them by his hand.

JER 27:9  Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor
 to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak
 unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:

JER 27:10  For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land;
 and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.

JER 27:11  But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of
 Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land,
 saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.

JER 27:12  I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words,
 saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him
 and his people, and live.

JER 27:13  Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the
 famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation
 that will not serve the king of Babylon?

JER 27:14  Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto
 you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie
 unto you.

JER 27:15  For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in
 my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the
 prophets that prophesy unto you.

JER 27:16  Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus
 saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto
 you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house shall now shortly be
 brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.

JER 27:17  Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
 wherefore should this city be laid waste?

JER 27:18  But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them,
 let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which
 are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and
 at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.

JER 27:19  For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and
 concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue
 of the vessels that remain in this city.

JER 27:20  Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away
 captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to
 Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;

JER 27:21  Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the
 vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of
 Judah and of Jerusalem;

JER 27:22  They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the
 day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore
 them to this place.

JER 28:1  And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of
 Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that
 Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me
 in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the
 people, saying,

JER 28:2  Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have
 broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.

JER 28:3  Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the
 vessels of the LORD's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away
 from this place, and carried them to Babylon:

JER 28:4  And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim
 king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith
 the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.

JER 28:5  Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the
 presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood
 in the house of the LORD,

JER 28:6  Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD
 perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels
 of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into
 this place.

JER 28:7  Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and
 in the ears of all the people;

JER 28:8  The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old
 prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of
 war, and of evil, and of pestilence.

JER 28:9  The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet
 shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly
 sent him.

JER 28:10  Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
 Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.

JER 28:11  And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus
 saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of
 Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And
 the prophet Jeremiah went his way.

JER 28:12  Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that
 Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet
 Jeremiah, saying,

JER 28:13  Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken
 the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.

JER 28:14  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a
 yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve
 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given
 him the beasts of the field also.

JER 28:15  Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now,
 Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust
 in a lie.

JER 28:16  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the
 face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught
 rebellion against the LORD.

JER 28:17  So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.

JER 29:1  Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent
 from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away
 captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom
 Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;

JER 29:2  (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the
 princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were
 departed from Jerusalem;)

JER 29:3  By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of
 Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar
 king of Babylon) saying,

JER 29:4  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are
 carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem
 unto Babylon;

JER 29:5  Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the
 fruit of them;

JER 29:6  Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your
 sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and
 daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.

JER 29:7  And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be
 carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace
 thereof shall ye have peace.

JER 29:8  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your
 prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither
 hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.

JER 29:9  For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them,
 saith the LORD.

JER 29:10  For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at
 Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you
 to return to this place.

JER 29:11  For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,
 thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.

JER 29:12  Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I
 will hearken unto you.

JER 29:13  And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with
 all your heart.

JER 29:14  And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away
 your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the
 places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again
 into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.

JER 29:15  Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in
 Babylon;

JER 29:16  Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the
 throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of
 your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;

JER 29:17  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the
 sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs,
 that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

JER 29:18  And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with
 the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms
 of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a
 reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:

JER 29:19  Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I
 sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them;
 but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.

JER 29:20  Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity,
 whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:

JER 29:21  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of
 Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you
 in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king
 of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;

JER 29:22  And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah
 which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab,
 whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;

JER 29:23  Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed
 adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my
 name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith
 the LORD.

JER 29:24  Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

JER 29:25  Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because
 thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at
 Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the
 priests, saying,

JER 29:26  The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest,
 that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is
 mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and
 in the stocks.

JER 29:27  Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which
 maketh himself a prophet to you?

JER 29:28  For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is
 long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the
 fruit of them.

JER 29:29  And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah
 the prophet.

JER 29:30  Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

JER 29:31  Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD
 concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied
 unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:

JER 29:32  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the
 Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people;
 neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the
 LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.

JER 30:1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

JER 30:2  Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the
 words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.

JER 30:3  For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the
 captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause
 them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall
 possess it.

JER 30:4  And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and
 concerning Judah.

JER 30:5  For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of
 fear, and not of peace.

JER 30:6  Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore
 do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and
 all faces are turned into paleness?

JER 30:7  Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the
 time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.

JER 30:8  For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that
 I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and
 strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:

JER 30:9  But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I
 will raise up unto them.

JER 30:10  Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither
 be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from
 the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in
 rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.

JER 30:11  For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a
 full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a
 full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee
 altogether unpunished.

JER 30:12  For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is
 grievous.

JER 30:13  There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou
 hast no healing medicines.

JER 30:14  All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have
 wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel
 one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.

JER 30:15  Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for
 the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done
 these things unto thee.

JER 30:16  Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine
 adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil
 thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.

JER 30:17  For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy
 wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is
 Zion, whom no man seeketh after.

JER 30:18  Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of
 Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be
 builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner
 thereof.

JER 30:19  And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them
 that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will
 also glorify them, and they shall not be small.

JER 30:20  Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation
 shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.

JER 30:21  And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall
 proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he
 shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach
 unto me? saith the LORD.

JER 30:22  And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

JER 30:23  Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a
 continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.

JER 30:24  The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath done
 it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days
 ye shall consider it.

JER 31:1  At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the
 families of Israel, and they shall be my people.

JER 31:2  Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found
 grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.

JER 31:3  The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee
 with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.

JER 31:4  Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel:
 thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the
 dances of them that make merry.

JER 31:5  Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
 planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.

JER 31:6  For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim
 shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God.

JER 31:7  For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout
 among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save
 thy people, the remnant of Israel.

JER 31:8  Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them
 from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman
 with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall
 return thither.

JER 31:9  They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead
 them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way,
 wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is
 my firstborn.

JER 31:10  Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles
 afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as
 a shepherd doth his flock.

JER 31:11  For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of
 him that was stronger than he.

JER 31:12  Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall
 flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for
 oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be
 as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.

JER 31:13  Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old
 together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and
 make them rejoice from their sorrow.

JER 31:14  And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my
 people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.

JER 31:15  Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and
 bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for
 her children, because they were not.

JER 31:16  Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes
 from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall
 come again from the land of the enemy.

JER 31:17  And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children
 shall come again to their own border.

JER 31:18  I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast
 chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke:
 turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God.

JER 31:19  Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was
 instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded,
 because I did bear the reproach of my youth.

JER 31:20  Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake
 against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are
 troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD.

JER 31:21  Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward
 the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel,
 turn again to these thy cities.

JER 31:22  How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the
 LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.

JER 31:23  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall
 use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall
 bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of
 justice, and mountain of holiness.

JER 31:24  And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof
 together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.

JER 31:25  For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every
 sorrowful soul.

JER 31:26  Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.

JER 31:27  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of
 Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of
 beast.

JER 31:28  And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to
 pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to
 afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.

JER 31:29  In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour
 grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.

JER 31:30  But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth
 the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.

JER 31:31  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new
 covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:

JER 31:32  Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the
 day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
 which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the
 LORD:

JER 31:33  But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of
 Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward
 parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be
 my people.

JER 31:34  And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man
 his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the
 least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive
 their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

JER 31:35  Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and
 the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which
 divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:

JER 31:36  If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the
 seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.

JER 31:37  Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the
 foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the
 seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.

JER 31:38  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built
 to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.

JER 31:39  And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the
 hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.

JER 31:40  And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all
 the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward
 the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown
 down any more for ever.

JER 32:1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of
 Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.

JER 32:2  For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah
 the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of
 Judah's house.

JER 32:3  For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost
 thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city
 into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;

JER 32:4  And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the
 Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of
 Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold
 his eyes;

JER 32:5  And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I
 visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not
 prosper.

JER 32:6  And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

JER 32:7  Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee
 saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is
 thine to buy it.

JER 32:8  So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison
 according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray
 thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right
 of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.
 Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.

JER 32:9  And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in
 Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.

JER 32:10  And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took
 witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.

JER 32:11  So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed
 according to the law and custom, and that which was open:

JER 32:12  And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of
 Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and
 in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase,
 before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.

JER 32:13  And I charged Baruch before them, saying,

JER 32:14  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these
 evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this
 evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may
 continue many days.

JER 32:15  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and
 fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.

JER 32:16  Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch
 the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,

JER 32:17  Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy
 great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:

JER 32:18  Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the
 iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the
 Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,

JER 32:19  Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon
 all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and
 according to the fruit of his doings:

JER 32:20  Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto
 this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as
 at this day;

JER 32:21  And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt
 with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched
 out arm, and with great terror;

JER 32:22  And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their
 fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;

JER 32:23  And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice,
 neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou
 commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon
 them:

JER 32:24  Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the
 city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because
 of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast
 spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.

JER 32:25  And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for
 money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the
 Chaldeans.

JER 32:26  Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

JER 32:27  Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too
 hard for me?

JER 32:28  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into
 the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of
 Babylon, and he shall take it:

JER 32:29  And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set
 fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have
 offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to
 provoke me to anger.

JER 32:30  For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done
 evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only
 provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.

JER 32:31  For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of
 my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should
 remove it from before my face,

JER 32:32  Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the
 children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their
 kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of
 Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

JER 32:33  And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I
 taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened
 to receive instruction.

JER 32:34  But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my
 name, to defile it.

JER 32:35  And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley
 of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through
 the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my
 mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.

JER 32:36  And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning
 this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of
 Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;

JER 32:37  Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have
 driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will
 bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:

JER 32:38  And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:

JER 32:39  And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me
 for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:

JER 32:40  And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not
 turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts,
 that they shall not depart from me.

JER 32:41  Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them
 in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.

JER 32:42  For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil
 upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised
 them.

JER 32:43  And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is
 desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.

JER 32:44  Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal
 them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about
 Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains,
 and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will
 cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.

JER 33:1  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time,
 while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,

JER 33:2  Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to
 establish it; the LORD is his name;

JER 33:3  Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty
 things, which thou knowest not.

JER 33:4  For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of
 this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown
 down by the mounts, and by the sword;

JER 33:5  They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with
 the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and
 for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.

JER 33:6  Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and
 will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.

JER 33:7  And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel
 to return, and will build them, as at the first.

JER 33:8  And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have
 sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have
 sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.

JER 33:9  And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before
 all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto
 them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the
 prosperity that I procure unto it.

JER 33:10  Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which
 ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of
 Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and
 without inhabitant, and without beast,

JER 33:11  The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
 bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say,
 Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth for
 ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house
 of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the
 first, saith the LORD.

JER 33:12  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate
 without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an
 habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.

JER 33:13  In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and
 in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places
 about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again
 under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD.

JER 33:14  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good
 thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of
 Judah.

JER 33:15  In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
 righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and
 righteousness in the land.

JER 33:16  In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
 safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our
 righteousness.

JER 33:17  For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon
 the throne of the house of Israel;

JER 33:18  Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer
 burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice
 continually.

JER 33:19  And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,

JER 33:20  Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my
 covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their
 season;

JER 33:21  Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he
 should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the
 priests, my ministers.

JER 33:22  As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the
 sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the
 Levites that minister unto me.

JER 33:23  Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,

JER 33:24  Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two
 families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they
 have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.

JER 33:25  Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and
 if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;

JER 33:26  Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so
 that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham,
 Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy
 on them.

JER 34:1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar
 king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his
 dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the
 cities thereof, saying,

JER 34:2  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king
 of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city
 into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:

JER 34:3  And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be
 taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes
 of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou
 shalt go to Babylon.

JER 34:4  Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith
 the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:

JER 34:5  But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers,
 the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee;
 and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word,
 saith the LORD.

JER 34:6  Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of
 Judah in Jerusalem,

JER 34:7  When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against
 all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah:
 for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.

JER 34:8  This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that
 the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at
 Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;

JER 34:9  That every man should let his manservant, and every man his
 maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve
 himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.

JER 34:10  Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into
 the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one
 his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any
 more, then they obeyed, and let them go.

JER 34:11  But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the
 handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into
 subjection for servants and for handmaids.

JER 34:12  Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
 saying,

JER 34:13  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your
 fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out
 of the house of bondmen, saying,

JER 34:14  At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew,
 which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou
 shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me,
 neither inclined their ear.

JER 34:15  And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in
 proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant
 before me in the house which is called by my name:

JER 34:16  But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his
 servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their
 pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for
 servants and for handmaids.

JER 34:17  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in
 proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his
 neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the
 sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be
 removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.

JER 34:18  And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which
 have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me,
 when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,

JER 34:19  The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and
 the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts
 of the calf;

JER 34:20  I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the
 hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat
 unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.

JER 34:21  And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand
 of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into
 the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.

JER 34:22  Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to
 this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with
 fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.

JER 35:1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of
 Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

JER 35:2  Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring
 them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine
 to drink.

JER 35:3  Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and
 his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;

JER 35:4  And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber
 of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the
 chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of
 Shallum, the keeper of the door:

JER 35:5  And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of
 wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.

JER 35:6  But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab
 our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your
 sons for ever:

JER 35:7  Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor
 have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many
 days in the land where ye be strangers.

JER 35:8  Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father
 in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives,
 our sons, nor our daughters;

JER 35:9  Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor
 field, nor seed:

JER 35:10  But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to
 all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

JER 35:11  But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up
 into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the
 army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell
 at Jerusalem.

JER 35:12  Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

JER 35:13  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men
 of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to
 hearken to my words? saith the LORD.

JER 35:14  The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons
 not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey
 their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising
 early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.

JER 35:15  I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up
 early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil
 way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye
 shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye
 have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.

JER 35:16  Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the
 commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath
 not hearkened unto me:

JER 35:17  Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel;
 Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all
 the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto
 them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not
 answered.

JER 35:18  And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the
 LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of
 Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all
 that he hath commanded you:

JER 35:19  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab
 the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.

JER 36:1  And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
 king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

JER 36:2  Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I
 have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the
 nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto
 this day.

JER 36:3  It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I
 purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way;
 that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.

JER 36:4  Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from
 the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto
 him, upon a roll of a book.

JER 36:5  And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into
 the house of the LORD:

JER 36:6  Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from
 my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house
 upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah
 that come out of their cities.

JER 36:7  It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and
 will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury
 that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.

JER 36:8  And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the
 prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the
 LORD's house.

JER 36:9  And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
 king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the
 LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the
 cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.

JER 36:10  Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house
 of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the
 higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears
 of all the people.

JER 36:11  When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out
 of the book all the words of the LORD,

JER 36:12  Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber:
 and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the
 son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of
 Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.

JER 36:13  Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard,
 when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.

JER 36:14  Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son
 of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the
 roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch
 the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.

JER 36:15  And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So
 Baruch read it in their ears.

JER 36:16  Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were
 afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king
 of all these words.

JER 36:17  And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all
 these words at his mouth?

JER 36:18  Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me
 with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.

JER 36:19  Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah;
 and let no man know where ye be.

JER 36:20  And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the
 roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the
 ears of the king.

JER 36:21  So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of
 Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the
 king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.

JER 36:22  Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there
 was a fire on the hearth burning before him.

JER 36:23  And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves,
 he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the
 hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.

JER 36:24  Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king,
 nor any of his servants that heard all these words.

JER 36:25  Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession
 to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.

JER 36:26  But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah
 the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe
 and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.

JER 36:27  Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had
 burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah,
 saying,

JER 36:28  Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words
 that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.

JER 36:29  And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD;
 Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying,
 The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall
 cause to cease from thence man and beast?

JER 36:30  Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall
 have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast
 out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.

JER 36:31  And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
 iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of
 Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced
 against them; but they hearkened not.

JER 36:32  Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the
 scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all
 the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire:
 and there were added besides unto them many like words.

JER 37:1  And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son
 of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of
 Judah.

JER 37:2  But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did
 hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.

JER 37:3  And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah
 the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto
 the LORD our God for us.

JER 37:4  Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not
 put him into prison.

JER 37:5  Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the
 Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from
 Jerusalem.

JER 37:6  Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,

JER 37:7  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king
 of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army,
 which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.

JER 37:8  And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and
 take it, and burn it with fire.

JER 37:9  Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans
 shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.

JER 37:10  For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight
 against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they
 rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.

JER 37:11  And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken
 up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,

JER 37:12  Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of
 Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.

JER 37:13  And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was
 there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and
 he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.

JER 37:14  Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans.
 But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the
 princes.

JER 37:15  Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and
 put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that
 the prison.

JER 37:16  When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and
 Jeremiah had remained there many days;

JER 37:17  Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked
 him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And
 Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand
 of the king of Babylon.

JER 37:18  Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended
 against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have
 put me in prison?

JER 37:19  Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The
 king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?

JER 37:20  Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my
 supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to
 return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.

JER 37:21  Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah
 into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of
 bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent.
 Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

JER 38:1  Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
 Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard
 the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,

JER 38:2  Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the
 sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the
 Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.

JER 38:3  Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand
 of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.

JER 38:4  Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this
 man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that
 remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words
 unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.

JER 38:5  Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king
 is not he that can do any thing against you.

JER 38:6  Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah
 the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down
 Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so
 Jeremiah sunk in the mire.

JER 38:7  Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was
 in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the
 king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;

JER 38:8  Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king
 saying,

JER 38:9  My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done
 to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like
 to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the
 city.

JER 38:10  Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from
 hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the
 dungeon, before he die.

JER 38:11  So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the
 king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags,
 and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.

JER 38:12  And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old
 cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And
 Jeremiah did so.

JER 38:13  So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the
 dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

JER 38:14  Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him
 into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto
 Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.

JER 38:15  Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt
 thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not
 hearken unto me?

JER 38:16  So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the
 LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither
 will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.

JER 38:17  Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of
 hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of
 Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be
 burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:

JER 38:18  But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then
 shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn
 it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.

JER 38:19  And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews
 that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and
 they mock me.

JER 38:20  But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech
 thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well
 unto thee, and thy soul shall live.

JER 38:21  But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath
 shewed me:

JER 38:22  And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's
 house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those
 women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against
 thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.

JER 38:23  So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the
 Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by
 the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned
 with fire.

JER 38:24  Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words,
 and thou shalt not die.

JER 38:25  But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come
 unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto
 the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what
 the king said unto thee:

JER 38:26  Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before
 the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die
 there.

JER 38:27  Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told
 them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left
 off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.

JER 38:28  So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that
 Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.

JER 39:1  In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they
 besieged it.

JER 39:2  And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth
 day of the month, the city was broken up.

JER 39:3  And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the
 middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris,
 Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of
 Babylon.

JER 39:4  And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
 them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city
 by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls:
 and he went out the way of the plain.

JER 39:5  But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah
 in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to
 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave
 judgment upon him.

JER 39:6  Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before
 his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.

JER 39:7  Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to
 carry him to Babylon.

JER 39:8  And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the
 people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.

JER 39:9  Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into
 Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that
 fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.

JER 39:10  But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the
 people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and
 fields at the same time.

JER 39:11  Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah
 to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,

JER 39:12  Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him
 even as he shall say unto thee.

JER 39:13  So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,
 Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;

JER 39:14  Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the
 prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
 that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.

JER 39:15  Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up
 in the court of the prison, saying,

JER 39:16  Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the
 LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this
 city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day
 before thee.

JER 39:17  But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt
 not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.

JER 39:18  For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the
 sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy
 trust in me, saith the LORD.

JER 40:1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan
 the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him
 being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem
 and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.

JER 40:2  And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The
 LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.

JER 40:3  Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said:
 because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his
 voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.

JER 40:4  And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were
 upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon,
 come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come
 with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither
 it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.

JER 40:5  Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah
 the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made
 governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go
 wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the
 guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.

JER 40:6  Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and
 dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.

JER 40:7  Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields,
 even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the
 son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and
 women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not
 carried away captive to Babylon;

JER 40:8  Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
 Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son
 of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of
 a Maachathite, they and their men.

JER 40:9  And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and
 to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and
 serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.

JER 40:10  As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans,
 which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and
 oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have
 taken.

JER 40:11  Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the
 Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the
 king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them
 Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;

JER 40:12  Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were
 driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered
 wine and summer fruits very much.

JER 40:13  Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
 forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,

JER 40:14  And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king
 of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But
 Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.

JER 40:15  Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly
 saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of
 Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all
 the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in
 Judah perish?

JER 40:16  But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah,
 Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.

JER 41:1  Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of
 Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the
 king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
 and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.

JER 41:2  Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were
 with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the
 sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the
 land.

JER 41:3  Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with
 Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of
 war.

JER 41:4  And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and
 no man knew it,

JER 41:5  That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria,
 even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and
 having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring
 them to the house of the LORD.

JER 41:6  And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them,
 weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said
 unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.

JER 41:7  And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that
 Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the
 pit, he, and the men that were with him.

JER 41:8  But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us
 not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of
 oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.

JER 41:9  Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men,
 whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for
 fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it
 with them that were slain.

JER 41:10  Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that
 were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained
 in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to
 Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them
 away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.

JER 41:11  But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
 forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of
 Nethaniah had done,

JER 41:12  Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son
 of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.

JER 41:13  Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with
 Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
 that were with him, then they were glad.

JER 41:14  So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah
 cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.

JER 41:15  But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight
 men, and went to the Ammonites.

JER 41:16  Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
 forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had
 recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had
 slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and
 the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:

JER 41:17  And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is
 by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,

JER 41:18  Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because
 Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the
 king of Babylon made governor in the land.

JER 42:1  Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of
 Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least
 even unto the greatest, came near,

JER 42:2  And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our
 supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God,
 even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes
 do behold us:)

JER 42:3  That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and
 the thing that we may do.

JER 42:4  Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I
 will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come
 to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it
 unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.

JER 42:5  Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness
 between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD
 thy God shall send thee to us.

JER 42:6  Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice
 of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when
 we obey the voice of the LORD our God.

JER 42:7  And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came
 unto Jeremiah.

JER 42:8  Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
 forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the
 greatest,

JER 42:9  And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom
 ye sent me to present your supplication before him;

JER 42:10  If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not
 pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me
 of the evil that I have done unto you.

JER 42:11  Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not
 afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver
 you from his hand.

JER 42:12  And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon
 you, and cause you to return to your own land.

JER 42:13  But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the
 voice of the LORD your God,

JER 42:14  Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall
 see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and
 there will we dwell:

JER 42:15  And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah;
 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces
 to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;

JER 42:16  Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall
 overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were
 afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.

JER 42:17  So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into
 Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by
 the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I
 will bring upon them.

JER 42:18  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger
 and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so
 shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and
 ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach;
 and ye shall see this place no more.

JER 42:19  The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not
 into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.

JER 42:20  For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your
 God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that
 the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.

JER 42:21  And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed
 the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me
 unto you.

JER 42:22  Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the
 famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to
 sojourn.

JER 43:1  And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
 unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD
 their God had sent him to them, even all these words,

JER 43:2  Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of
 Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely:
 the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn
 there:

JER 43:3  But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to
 deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to
 death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.

JER 43:4  So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and
 all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of
 Judah.

JER 43:5  But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
 took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither
 they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;

JER 43:6  Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and
 every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah
 the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch
 the son of Neriah.

JER 43:7  So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice
 of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.

JER 43:8  Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,

JER 43:9  Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the
 brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the
 sight of the men of Judah;

JER 43:10  And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
 Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my
 servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he
 shall spread his royal pavilion over them.

JER 43:11  And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver
 such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity;
 and such as are for the sword to the sword.

JER 43:12  And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he
 shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself
 with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go
 forth from thence in peace.

JER 43:13  He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land
 of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with
 fire.

JER 44:1  The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell
 in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at
 Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,

JER 44:2  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the
 evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah;
 and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,

JER 44:3  Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me
 to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom
 they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.

JER 44:4  Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early
 and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.

JER 44:5  But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their
 wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.

JER 44:6  Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled
 in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted
 and desolate, as at this day.

JER 44:7  Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of
 Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off
 from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none
 to remain;

JER 44:8  In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands,
 burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to
 dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a
 reproach among all the nations of the earth?

JER 44:9  Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness
 of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own
 wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed
 in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?

JER 44:10  They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared,
 nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before
 your fathers.

JER 44:11  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
 will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.

JER 44:12  And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to
 go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be
 consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the
 sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the
 greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an
 execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.

JER 44:13  For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have
 punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:

JER 44:14  So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land
 of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return
 into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell
 there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.

JER 44:15  Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto
 other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the
 people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah,
 saying,

JER 44:16  As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the
 LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.

JER 44:17  But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own
 mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink
 offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our
 princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then
 had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.

JER 44:18  But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to
 pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been
 consumed by the sword and by the famine.

JER 44:19  And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out
 drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out
 drink offerings unto her, without our men?

JER 44:20  Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the
 women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,

JER 44:21  The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the
 streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and
 the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into
 his mind?

JER 44:22  So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your
 doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is
 your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an
 inhabitant, as at this day.

JER 44:23  Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against
 the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law,
 nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened
 unto you, as at this day.

JER 44:24  Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women,
 Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:

JER 44:25  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your
 wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand,
 saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense
 to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will
 surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.

JER 44:26  Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the
 land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my
 name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land
 of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.

JER 44:27  Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all
 the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword
 and by the famine, until there be an end of them.

JER 44:28  Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the
 land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are
 gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall
 stand, mine, or their's.

JER 44:29  And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will
 punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand
 against you for evil:

JER 44:30  Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt
 into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life;
 as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of
 Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.

JER 45:1  The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of
 Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah,
 in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

JER 45:2  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch:

JER 45:3  Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my
 sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.

JER 45:4  Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which
 I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck
 up, even this whole land.

JER 45:5  And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for,
 behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I
 give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.

JER 46:1  The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the
 Gentiles;

JER 46:2  Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which
 was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of
 Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
 Judah.

JER 46:3  Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.

JER 46:4  Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with
 your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.

JER 46:5  Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their
 mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear
 was round about, saith the LORD.

JER 46:6  Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall
 stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.

JER 46:7  Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the
 rivers?

JER 46:8  Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the
 rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy
 the city and the inhabitants thereof.

JER 46:9  Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men
 come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the
 Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.

JER 46:10  For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance,
 that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it
 shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts
 hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.

JER 46:11  Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt:
 in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured.

JER 46:12  The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the
 land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are
 fallen both together.

JER 46:13  The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.

JER 46:14  Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and
 in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall
 devour round about thee.

JER 46:15  Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD
 did drive them.

JER 46:16  He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said,
 Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our
 nativity, from the oppressing sword.

JER 46:17  They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath
 passed the time appointed.

JER 46:18  As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely
 as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.

JER 46:19  O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into
 captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.

JER 46:20  Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh
 out of the north.

JER 46:21  Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for
 they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand,
 because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their
 visitation.

JER 46:22  The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with
 an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.

JER 46:23  They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be
 searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.

JER 46:24  The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered
 into the hand of the people of the north.

JER 46:25  The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish
 the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their
 kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:

JER 46:26  And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their
 lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand
 of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old,
 saith the LORD.

JER 46:27  But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O
 Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the
 land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at
 ease, and none shall make him afraid.

JER 46:28  Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with
 thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven
 thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure;
 yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.

JER 47:1  The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the
 Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.

JER 47:2  Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and
 shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is
 therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and
 all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.

JER 47:3  At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at
 the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers
 shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;

JER 47:4  Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and to
 cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will
 spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.

JER 47:5  Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant
 of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?

JER 47:6  O thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put
 up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.

JER 47:7  How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against
 Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.

JER 48:1  Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe
 unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is
 confounded and dismayed.

JER 48:2  There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised
 evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou
 shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.

JER 48:3  A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great
 destruction.

JER 48:4  Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.

JER 48:5  For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for
 in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.

JER 48:6  Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.

JER 48:7  For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou
 shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his
 priests and his princes together.

JER 48:8  And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape:
 the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD
 hath spoken.

JER 48:9  Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities
 thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.

JER 48:10  Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed
 be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.

JER 48:11  Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his
 lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone
 into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not
 changed.

JER 48:12  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send
 unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his
 vessels, and break their bottles.

JER 48:13  And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was
 ashamed of Bethel their confidence.

JER 48:14  How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?

JER 48:15  Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young
 men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of
 hosts.

JER 48:16  The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth
 fast.

JER 48:17  All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his
 name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod!

JER 48:18  Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory, and
 sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and he shall
 destroy thy strong holds.

JER 48:19  O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that
 fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?

JER 48:20  Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it
 in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,

JER 48:21  And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon
 Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,

JER 48:22  And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,

JER 48:23  And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,

JER 48:24  And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the
 land of Moab, far or near.

JER 48:25  The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.

JER 48:26  Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: Moab
 also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.

JER 48:27  For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves?
 for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.

JER 48:28  O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the
 rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's
 mouth.

JER 48:29  We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his
 loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his
 heart.

JER 48:30  I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies
 shall not so effect it.

JER 48:31  Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab;
 mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.

JER 48:32  O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer:
 thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the
 spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.

JER 48:33  And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the
 land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall
 tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.

JER 48:34  From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have
 they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three
 years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.

JER 48:35  Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that
 offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.

JER 48:36  Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart
 shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he
 hath gotten are perished.

JER 48:37  For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the
 hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.

JER 48:38  There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of
 Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel
 wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.

JER 48:39  They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned
 the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them
 about him.

JER 48:40  For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall
 spread his wings over Moab.

JER 48:41  Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty
 men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her
 pangs.

JER 48:42  And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath
 magnified himself against the LORD.

JER 48:43  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant
 of Moab, saith the LORD.

JER 48:44  He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that
 getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon
 it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.

JER 48:45  They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the
 force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst
 of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head
 of the tumultuous ones.

JER 48:46  Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy
 sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.

JER 48:47  Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days,
 saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

JER 49:1  Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons?
 hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell
 in his cities?

JER 49:2  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause
 an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a
 desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel
 be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.

JER 49:3  Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird
 you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king
 shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.

JER 49:4  Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O
 backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come
 unto me?

JER 49:5  Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts,
 from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right
 forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.

JER 49:6  And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of
 Ammon, saith the LORD.

JER 49:7  Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in
 Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?

JER 49:8  Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will
 bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.

JER 49:9  If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning
 grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.

JER 49:10  But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and
 he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his
 brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.

JER 49:11  Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let
 thy widows trust in me.

JER 49:12  For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to
 drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall
 altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely
 drink of it.

JER 49:13  For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become
 a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof
 shall be perpetual wastes.

JER 49:14  I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto
 the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up
 to the battle.

JER 49:15  For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised
 among men.

JER 49:16  Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O
 thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the
 hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring
 thee down from thence, saith the LORD.

JER 49:17  Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be
 astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.

JER 49:18  As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities
 thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man
 dwell in it.

JER 49:19  Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan
 against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away
 from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is
 like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will
 stand before me?

JER 49:20  Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against
 Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of
 Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall
 make their habitations desolate with them.

JER 49:21  The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise
 thereof was heard in the Red sea.

JER 49:22  Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings
 over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as
 the heart of a woman in her pangs.

JER 49:23  Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have
 heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it
 cannot be quiet.

JER 49:24  Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath
 seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.

JER 49:25  How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!

JER 49:26  Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men
 of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.

JER 49:27  And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall
 consume the palaces of Benhadad.

JER 49:28  Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go
 up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.

JER 49:29  Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take
 to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and
 they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.

JER 49:30  Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith
 the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against
 you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.

JER 49:31  Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without
 care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.

JER 49:32  And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle
 a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost
 corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the
 LORD.

JER 49:33  And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for
 ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.

JER 49:34  The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam
 in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,

JER 49:35  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of
 Elam, the chief of their might.

JER 49:36  And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of
 heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no
 nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.

JER 49:37  For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and
 before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my
 fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I
 have consumed them:

JER 49:38  And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the
 king and the princes, saith the LORD.

JER 49:39  But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring
 again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.

JER 50:1  The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land
 of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.

JER 50:2  Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard;
 publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach
 is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in
 pieces.

JER 50:3  For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which
 shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall
 remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.

JER 50:4  In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of
 Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and
 weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.

JER 50:5  They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying,
 Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that
 shall not be forgotten.

JER 50:6  My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to
 go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from
 mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.

JER 50:7  All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said,
 We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of
 justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.

JER 50:8  Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land
 of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.

JER 50:9  For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
 assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set
 themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows
 shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.

JER 50:10  And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied,
 saith the LORD.

JER 50:11  Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine
 heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as
 bulls;

JER 50:12  Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be
 ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry
 land, and a desert.

JER 50:13  Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it
 shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be
 astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.

JER 50:14  Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that
 bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the
 LORD.

JER 50:15  Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her
 foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance
 of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.

JER 50:16  Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle
 in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn
 every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.

JER 50:17  Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first
 the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of
 Babylon hath broken his bones.

JER 50:18  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
 will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of
 Assyria.

JER 50:19  And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed
 on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and
 Gilead.

JER 50:20  In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of
 Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of
 Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.

JER 50:21  Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against
 the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the
 LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.

JER 50:22  A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.

JER 50:23  How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is
 Babylon become a desolation among the nations!

JER 50:24  I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O
 Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because
 thou hast striven against the LORD.

JER 50:25  The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons
 of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land
 of the Chaldeans.

JER 50:26  Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast
 her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.

JER 50:27  Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto
 them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.

JER 50:28  The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon,
 to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his
 temple.

JER 50:29  Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow,
 camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her
 according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for
 she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.

JER 50:30  Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men
 of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.

JER 50:31  Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of
 hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.

JER 50:32  And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him
 up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round
 about him.

JER 50:33  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the
 children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives
 held them fast; they refused to let them go.

JER 50:34  Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall
 throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet
 the inhabitants of Babylon.

JER 50:35  A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the
 inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.

JER 50:36  A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her
 mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.

JER 50:37  A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all
 the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as
 women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.

JER 50:38  A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is
 the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.

JER 50:39  Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the
 islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be
 no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to
 generation.

JER 50:40  As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities
 thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son
 of man dwell therein.

JER 50:41  Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and
 many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.

JER 50:42  They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not
 shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon
 horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O
 daughter of Babylon.

JER 50:43  The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands
 waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.

JER 50:44  Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan
 unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away
 from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is
 like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will
 stand before me?

JER 50:45  Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken
 against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land
 of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely
 he shall make their habitation desolate with them.

JER 50:46  At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the
 cry is heard among the nations.

JER 51:1  Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and
 against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a
 destroying wind;

JER 51:2  And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall
 empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round
 about.

JER 51:3  Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him
 that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men;
 destroy ye utterly all her host.

JER 51:4  Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that
 are thrust through in her streets.

JER 51:5  For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD
 of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of
 Israel.

JER 51:6  Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be
 not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he
 will render unto her a recompence.

JER 51:7  Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the
 earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations
 are mad.

JER 51:8  Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for
 her pain, if so be she may be healed.

JER 51:9  We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and
 let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto
 heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.

JER 51:10  The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us
 declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.

JER 51:11  Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up
 the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to
 destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his
 temple.

JER 51:12  Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch
 strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both
 devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.

JER 51:13  O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine
 end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.

JER 51:14  The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill
 thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against
 thee.

JER 51:15  He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world
 by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.

JER 51:16  When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the
 heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he
 maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his
 treasures.

JER 51:17  Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded
 by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no
 breath in them.

JER 51:18  They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation
 they shall perish.

JER 51:19  The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all
 things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his
 name.

JER 51:20  Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I
 break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;

JER 51:21  And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and
 with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;

JER 51:22  With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee
 will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces
 the young man and the maid;

JER 51:23  I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock;
 and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and
 with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.

JER 51:24  And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea
 all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.

JER 51:25  Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD,
 which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon
 thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.

JER 51:26  And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone
 for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.

JER 51:27  Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the
 nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the
 kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her;
 cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.

JER 51:28  Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the
 captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his
 dominion.

JER 51:29  And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD
 shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation
 without an inhabitant.

JER 51:30  The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained
 in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have
 burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.

JER 51:31  One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet
 another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,

JER 51:32  And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned
 with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.

JER 51:33  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of
 Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little
 while, and the time of her harvest shall come.

JER 51:34  Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed
 me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon,
 he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.

JER 51:35  The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the
 inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall
 Jerusalem say.

JER 51:36  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and
 take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.

JER 51:37  And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an
 astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.

JER 51:38  They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions'
 whelps.

JER 51:39  In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them
 drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake,
 saith the LORD.

JER 51:40  I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with
 he goats.

JER 51:41  How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth
 surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!

JER 51:42  The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude
 of the waves thereof.

JER 51:43  Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land
 wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.

JER 51:44  And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his
 mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow
 together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.

JER 51:45  My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man
 his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.

JER 51:46  And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be
 heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in
 another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against
 ruler.

JER 51:47  Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the
 graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her
 slain shall fall in the midst of her.

JER 51:48  Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing
 for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the
 LORD.

JER 51:49  As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon
 shall fall the slain of all the earth.

JER 51:50  Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember
 the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.

JER 51:51  We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath
 covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD's
 house.

JER 51:52  Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do
 judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall
 groan.

JER 51:53  Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should
 fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her,
 saith the LORD.

JER 51:54  A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the
 land of the Chaldeans:

JER 51:55  Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the
 great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice
 is uttered:

JER 51:56  Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her
 mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of
 recompences shall surely requite.

JER 51:57  And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains,
 and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual
 sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.

JER 51:58  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be
 utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people
 shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.

JER 51:59  The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of
 Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah
 into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet
 prince.

JER 51:60  So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon
 Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.

JER 51:61  And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt
 see, and shalt read all these words;

JER 51:62  Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to
 cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it
 shall be desolate for ever.

JER 51:63  And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book,
 that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:

JER 51:64  And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from
 the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are
 the words of Jeremiah.

JER 52:1  Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the
 daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

JER 52:2  And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to
 all that Jehoiakim had done.

JER 52:3  For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and
 Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled
 against the king of Babylon.

JER 52:4  And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
 month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
 came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and
 built forts against it round about.

JER 52:5  So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.

JER 52:6  And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine
 was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.

JER 52:7  Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went
 forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls,
 which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round
 about:) and they went by the way of the plain.

JER 52:8  But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook
 Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.

JER 52:9  Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon
 to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.

JER 52:10  And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes:
 he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.

JER 52:11  Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound
 him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day
 of his death.

JER 52:12  Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the
 nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain
 of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,

JER 52:13  And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the
 houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with
 fire:

JER 52:14  And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the
 guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.

JER 52:15  Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
 certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that
 remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of
 Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.

JER 52:16  But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor
 of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.

JER 52:17  Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and
 the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the
 Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.

JER 52:18  The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls,
 and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took
 they away.

JER 52:19  And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons,
 and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in
 gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard
 away.

JER 52:20  The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under
 the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of
 all these vessels was without weight.

JER 52:21  And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen
 cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness
 thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.

JER 52:22  And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter
 was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round
 about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like
 unto these.

JER 52:23  And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the
 pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.

JER 52:24  And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
 Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:

JER 52:25  He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the
 men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which
 were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered
 the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that
 were found in the midst of the city.

JER 52:26  So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them
 to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

JER 52:27  And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah
 in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own
 land.

JER 52:28  This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the
 seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:

JER 52:29  In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive
 from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:

JER 52:30  In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the
 captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and
 five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.

JER 52:31  And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity
 of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth
 day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his
 reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth
 out of prison.

JER 52:32  And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne
 of the kings that were with him in Babylon,

JER 52:33  And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread
 before him all the days of his life.

JER 52:34  And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king
 of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of
 his life.

JOE 1:1  The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

JOE 1:2  Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.
 Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?

JOE 1:3  Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their
 children, and their children another generation.

JOE 1:4  That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that
 which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the
 cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.

JOE 1:5  Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine,
 because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.

JOE 1:6  For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number,
 whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great
 lion.

JOE 1:7  He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it
 clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.

JOE 1:8  Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her
 youth.

JOE 1:9  The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house
 of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.

JOE 1:10  The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the
 new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.

JOE 1:11  Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the
 wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.

JOE 1:12  The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate
 tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the
 field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.

JOE 1:13  Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the
 altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat
 offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.

JOE 1:14  Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all
 the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto
 the LORD,

JOE 1:15  Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a
 destruction from the Almighty shall it come.

JOE 1:16  Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from
 the house of our God?

JOE 1:17  The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid
 desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.

JOE 1:18  How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because
 they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.

JOE 1:19  O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures
 of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.

JOE 1:20  The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters
 are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

JOE 2:1  Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain:
 let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh,
 for it is nigh at hand;

JOE 2:2  A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick
 darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a
 strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after
 it, even to the years of many generations.

JOE 2:3  A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the
 land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate
 wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.

JOE 2:4  The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as
 horsemen, so shall they run.

JOE 2:5  Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap,
 like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong
 people set in battle array.

JOE 2:6  Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall
 gather blackness.

JOE 2:7  They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of
 war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break
 their ranks:

JOE 2:8  Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his
 path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.

JOE 2:9  They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the
 wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows
 like a thief.

JOE 2:10  The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun
 and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:

JOE 2:11  And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is
 very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD
 is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?

JOE 2:12  Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your
 heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:

JOE 2:13  And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD
 your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
 kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

JOE 2:14  Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind
 him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?

JOE 2:15  Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:

JOE 2:16  Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders,
 gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go
 forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.

JOE 2:17  Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch
 and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine
 heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore
 should they say among the people, Where is their God?

JOE 2:18  Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.

JOE 2:19  Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will
 send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I
 will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:

JOE 2:20  But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive
 him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and
 his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his
 ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.

JOE 2:21  Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great
 things.

JOE 2:22  Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the
 wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the
 vine do yield their strength.

JOE 2:23  Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God:
 for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come
 down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first
 month.

JOE 2:24  And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow
 with wine and oil.

JOE 2:25  And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the
 cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I
 sent among you.

JOE 2:26  And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name
 of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people
 shall never be ashamed.

JOE 2:27  And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the
 LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.

JOE 2:28  And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit
 upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men
 shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:

JOE 2:29  And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will
 I pour out my spirit.

JOE 2:30  And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and
 fire, and pillars of smoke.

JOE 2:31  The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
 before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.

JOE 2:32  And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name
 of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be
 deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall
 call.

JOE 3:1  For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again
 the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,

JOE 3:2  I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the
 valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for
 my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my
 land.

JOE 3:3  And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an
 harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.

JOE 3:4  Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the
 coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me,
 swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;

JOE 3:5  Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into
 your temples my goodly pleasant things:

JOE 3:6  The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold
 unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.

JOE 3:7  Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold
 them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:

JOE 3:8  And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the
 children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far
 off: for the LORD hath spoken it.

JOE 3:9  Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty
 men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:

JOE 3:10  Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears:
 let the weak say, I am strong.

JOE 3:11  Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves
 together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.

JOE 3:12  Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat:
 for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.

JOE 3:13  Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down;
 for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.

JOE 3:14  Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the
 LORD is near in the valley of decision.

JOE 3:15  The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw
 their shining.

JOE 3:16  The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from
 Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be
 the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.

JOE 3:17  So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my
 holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers
 pass through her any more.

JOE 3:18  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop
 down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of
 Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the
 house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.

JOE 3:19  Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness,
 for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed
 innocent blood in their land.

JOE 3:20  But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to
 generation.

JOE 3:21  For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the LORD
 dwelleth in Zion.

JON 1:1  Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,

JON 1:2  Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their
 wickedness is come up before me.

JON 1:3  But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the
 LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he
 paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish
 from the presence of the LORD.

JON 1:4  But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a
 mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.

JON 1:5  Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and
 cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it
 of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and
 was fast asleep.

JON 1:6  So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O
 sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that
 we perish not.

JON 1:7  And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots,
 that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and
 the lot fell upon Jonah.

JON 1:8  Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this
 evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is
 thy country? and of what people art thou?

JON 1:9  And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of
 heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.

JON 1:10  Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast
 thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD,
 because he had told them.

JON 1:11  Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may
 be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.

JON 1:12  And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so
 shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great
 tempest is upon you.

JON 1:13  Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they
 could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.

JON 1:14  Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O
 LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not
 upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.

JON 1:15  So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea
 ceased from her raging.

JON 1:16  Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice
 unto the LORD, and made vows.

JON 1:17  Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah
 was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

JON 2:1  Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,

JON 2:2  And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he
 heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.

JON 2:3  For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and
 the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.

JON 2:4  Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward
 thy holy temple.

JON 2:5  The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me
 round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

JON 2:6  I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars
 was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O
 LORD my God.

JON 2:7  When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer
 came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

JON 2:8  They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

JON 2:9  But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will
 pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

JON 2:10  And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the
 dry land.

JON 3:1  And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,

JON 3:2  Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the
 preaching that I bid thee.

JON 3:3  So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the
 LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.

JON 3:4  And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
 cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

JON 3:5  So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put
 on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.

JON 3:6  For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
 throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and
 sat in ashes.

JON 3:7  And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the
 decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd
 nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:

JON 3:8  But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto
 God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence
 that is in their hands.

JON 3:9  Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his
 fierce anger, that we perish not?

JON 3:10  And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and
 God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he
 did it not.

JON 4:1  But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

JON 4:2  And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not
 this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto
 Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to
 anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.

JON 4:3  Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it
 is better for me to die than to live.

JON 4:4  Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?

JON 4:5  So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the
 city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he
 might see what would become of the city.

JON 4:6  And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah,
 that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So
 Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

JON 4:7  But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it
 smote the gourd that it withered.

JON 4:8  And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a
 vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he
 fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die
 than to live.

JON 4:9  And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And
 he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.

JON 4:10  Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which
 thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and
 perished in a night:

JON 4:11  And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more
 then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand
 and their left hand; and also much cattle?

LAM 1:1  How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she
 become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among
 the provinces, how is she become tributary!

LAM 1:2  She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among
 all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt
 treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.

LAM 1:3  Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of
 great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her
 persecutors overtook her between the straits.

LAM 1:4  The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all
 her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she
 is in bitterness.

LAM 1:5  Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath
 afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone
 into captivity before the enemy.

LAM 1:6  And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes
 are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without
 strength before the pursuer.

LAM 1:7  Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries
 all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell
 into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw
 her, and did mock at her sabbaths.

LAM 1:8  Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that
 honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she
 sigheth, and turneth backward.

LAM 1:9  Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end;
 therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my
 affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.

LAM 1:10  The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things:
 for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou
 didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.

LAM 1:11  All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant
 things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am
 become vile.

LAM 1:12  Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there
 be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD
 hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.

LAM 1:13  From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against
 them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made
 me desolate and faint all the day.

LAM 1:14  The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are
 wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the
 LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.

LAM 1:15  The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of
 me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD
 hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.

LAM 1:16  For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water,
 because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children
 are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.

LAM 1:17  Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the
 LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round
 about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.

LAM 1:18  The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment:
 hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young
 men are gone into captivity.

LAM 1:19  I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine
 elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve
 their souls.

LAM 1:20  Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine
 heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword
 bereaveth, at home there is as death.

LAM 1:21  They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine
 enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou
 wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.

LAM 1:22  Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou
 hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my
 heart is faint.

LAM 2:1  How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his
 anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and
 remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!

LAM 2:2  The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not
 pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of
 Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom
 and the princes thereof.

LAM 2:3  He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath
 drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob
 like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.

LAM 2:4  He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an
 adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle
 of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.

LAM 2:5  The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
 swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath
 increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.

LAM 2:6  And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a
 garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused
 the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised
 in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.

LAM 2:7  The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he
 hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have
 made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.

LAM 2:8  The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he
 hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying:
 therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished
 together.

LAM 2:9  Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her
 bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more;
 her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.

LAM 2:10  The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep
 silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves
 with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.

LAM 2:11  Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is
 poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people;
 because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.

LAM 2:12  They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned
 as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out
 into their mothers' bosom.

LAM 2:13  What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken
 to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may
 comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the
 sea: who can heal thee?

LAM 2:14  Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they
 have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen
 for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.

LAM 2:15  All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their
 head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The
 perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?

LAM 2:16  All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and
 gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the
 day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.

LAM 2:17  The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his
 word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath
 not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set
 up the horn of thine adversaries.

LAM 2:18  Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let
 tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the
 apple of thine eye cease.

LAM 2:19  Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out
 thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy hands toward
 him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of
 every street.

LAM 2:20  Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the
 women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the
 prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?

LAM 2:21  The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins
 and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of
 thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.

LAM 2:22  Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that
 in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have
 swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.

LAM 3:1  I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.

LAM 3:2  He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.

LAM 3:3  Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the
 day.

LAM 3:4  My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.

LAM 3:5  He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.

LAM 3:6  He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.

LAM 3:7  He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain
 heavy.

LAM 3:8  Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.

LAM 3:9  He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths
 crooked.

LAM 3:10  He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret
 places.

LAM 3:11  He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made
 me desolate.

LAM 3:12  He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

LAM 3:13  He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.

LAM 3:14  I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.

LAM 3:15  He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with
 wormwood.

LAM 3:16  He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me
 with ashes.

LAM 3:17  And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
 prosperity.

LAM 3:18  And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:

LAM 3:19  Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.

LAM 3:20  My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

LAM 3:21  This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

LAM 3:22  It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his
 compassions fail not.

LAM 3:23  They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.

LAM 3:24  The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.

LAM 3:25  The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that
 seeketh him.

LAM 3:26  It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
 salvation of the LORD.

LAM 3:27  It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.

LAM 3:28  He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon
 him.

LAM 3:29  He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.

LAM 3:30  He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with
 reproach.

LAM 3:31  For the LORD will not cast off for ever:

LAM 3:32  But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according
 to the multitude of his mercies.

LAM 3:33  For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.

LAM 3:34  To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.

LAM 3:35  To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,

LAM 3:36  To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.

LAM 3:37  Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth
 it not?

LAM 3:38  Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?

LAM 3:39  Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his
 sins?

LAM 3:40  Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.

LAM 3:41  Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.

LAM 3:42  We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.

LAM 3:43  Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain,
 thou hast not pitied.

LAM 3:44  Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not
 pass through.

LAM 3:45  Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the
 people.

LAM 3:46  All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

LAM 3:47  Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

LAM 3:48  Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the
 daughter of my people.

LAM 3:49  Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission.

LAM 3:50  Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.

LAM 3:51  Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my
 city.

LAM 3:52  Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.

LAM 3:53  They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.

LAM 3:54  Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.

LAM 3:55  I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.

LAM 3:56  Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my
 cry.

LAM 3:57  Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst,
 Fear not.

LAM 3:58  O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed
 my life.

LAM 3:59  O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.

LAM 3:60  Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against
 me.

LAM 3:61  Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations
 against me;

LAM 3:62  The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against
 me all the day.

LAM 3:63  Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.

LAM 3:64  Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their
 hands.

LAM 3:65  Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

LAM 3:66  Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the
 LORD.

LAM 4:1  How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the
 stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.

LAM 4:2  The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they
 esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!

LAM 4:3  Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their
 young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches
 in the wilderness.

LAM 4:4  The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for
 thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.

LAM 4:5  They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that
 were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.

LAM 4:6  For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is
 greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a
 moment, and no hands stayed on her.

LAM 4:7  Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they
 were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:

LAM 4:8  Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the
 streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become
 like a stick.

LAM 4:9  They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain
 with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits
 of the field.

LAM 4:10  The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they
 were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.

LAM 4:11  The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce
 anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations
 thereof.

LAM 4:12  The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would
 not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into
 the gates of Jerusalem.

LAM 4:13  For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that
 have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,

LAM 4:14  They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted
 themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.

LAM 4:15  They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch
 not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They
 shall no more sojourn there.

LAM 4:16  The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them:
 they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.

LAM 4:17  As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching
 we have watched for a nation that could not save us.

LAM 4:18  They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is
 near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.

LAM 4:19  Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they
 pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.

LAM 4:20  The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken
 in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the
 heathen.

LAM 4:21  Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of
 Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and
 shalt make thyself naked.

LAM 4:22  The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion;
 he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity,
 O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.

LAM 5:1  Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our
 reproach.

LAM 5:2  Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.

LAM 5:3  We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.

LAM 5:4  We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.

LAM 5:5  Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.

LAM 5:6  We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be
 satisfied with bread.

LAM 5:7  Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their
 iniquities.

LAM 5:8  Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out
 of their hand.

LAM 5:9  We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword
 of the wilderness.

LAM 5:10  Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.

LAM 5:11  They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of
 Judah.

LAM 5:12  Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not
 honoured.

LAM 5:13  They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the
 wood.

LAM 5:14  The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their
 musick.

LAM 5:15  The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.

LAM 5:16  The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!

LAM 5:17  For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.

LAM 5:18  Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk
 upon it.

LAM 5:19  Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to
 generation.

LAM 5:20  Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?

LAM 5:21  Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our
 days as of old.

LAM 5:22  But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.

MAL 1:1  The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.

MAL 1:2  I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved
 us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,

MAL 1:3  And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for
 the dragons of the wilderness.

MAL 1:4  Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build
 the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I
 will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The
 people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.

MAL 1:5  And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified
 from the border of Israel.

MAL 1:6  A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a
 father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith
 the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say,
 Wherein have we despised thy name?

MAL 1:7  Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we
 polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.

MAL 1:8  And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye
 offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will
 he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.

MAL 1:9  And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us:
 this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of
 hosts.

MAL 1:10  Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?
 neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in
 you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.

MAL 1:11  For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same
 my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall
 be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great
 among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.

MAL 1:12  But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is
 polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.

MAL 1:13  Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at
 it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the
 lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your
 hand? saith the LORD.

MAL 1:14  But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and
 voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King,
 saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.

MAL 2:1  And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.

MAL 2:2  If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory
 unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and
 I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do
 not lay it to heart.

MAL 2:3  Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,
 even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.

MAL 2:4  And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my
 covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

MAL 2:5  My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for
 the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.

MAL 2:6  The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his
 lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from
 iniquity.

MAL 2:7  For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the
 law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.

MAL 2:8  But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at
 the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

MAL 2:9  Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the
 people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the
 law.

MAL 2:10  Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we
 deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant
 of our fathers?

MAL 2:11  Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in
 Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD
 which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.

MAL 2:12  The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the
 scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering
 unto the LORD of hosts.

MAL 2:13  And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with
 tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the
 offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand.

MAL 2:14  Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between
 thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously:
 yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.

MAL 2:15  And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And
 wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your
 spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.

MAL 2:16  For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away:
 for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts:
 therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.

MAL 2:17  Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we
 wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight
 of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?

MAL 3:1  Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before
 me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the
 messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith
 the LORD of hosts.

MAL 3:2  But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he
 appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:

MAL 3:3  And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall
 purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may
 offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.

MAL 3:4  Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the
 LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.

MAL 3:5  And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness
 against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false
 swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the
 widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his
 right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.

MAL 3:6  For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
 consumed.

MAL 3:7  Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
 ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto
 you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?

MAL 3:8  Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we
 robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.

MAL 3:9  Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole
 nation.

MAL 3:10  Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat
 in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will
 not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there
 shall not be room enough to receive it.

MAL 3:11  And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not
 destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit
 before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.

MAL 3:12  And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome
 land, saith the LORD of hosts.

MAL 3:13  Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say,
 What have we spoken so much against thee?

MAL 3:14  Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we
 have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD
 of hosts?

MAL 3:15  And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are
 set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.

MAL 3:16  Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the
 LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before
 him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.

MAL 3:17  And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I
 make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that
 serveth him.

MAL 3:18  Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the
 wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.

MAL 4:1  For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the
 proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that
 cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them
 neither root nor branch.

MAL 4:2  But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise
 with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves
 of the stall.

MAL 4:3  And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the
 soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.

MAL 4:4  Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in
 Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.

MAL 4:5  Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the
 great and dreadful day of the LORD:

MAL 4:6  And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the
 heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with
 a curse.

MIC 1:1  The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of
 Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria
 and Jerusalem.

MIC 1:2  Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and
 let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from his holy temple.

MIC 1:3  For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come
 down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.

MIC 1:4  And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be
 cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep
 place.

MIC 1:5  For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the
 house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and
 what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?

MIC 1:6  Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as
 plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the
 valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.

MIC 1:7  And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all
 the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof
 will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they
 shall return to the hire of an harlot.

MIC 1:8  Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will
 make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.

MIC 1:9  For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto
 the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.

MIC 1:10  Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah
 roll thyself in the dust.

MIC 1:11  Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the
 inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall
 receive of you his standing.

MIC 1:12  For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came
 down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.

MIC 1:13  O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast:
 she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the
 transgressions of Israel were found in thee.

MIC 1:14  Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of
 Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.

MIC 1:15  Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he
 shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.

MIC 1:16  Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy
 baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.

MIC 2:1  Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when
 the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their
 hand.

MIC 2:2  And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take
 them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.

MIC 2:3  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise
 an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go
 haughtily: for this time is evil.

MIC 2:4  In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a
 doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the
 portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath
 divided our fields.

MIC 2:5  Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the
 congregation of the LORD.

MIC 2:6  Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not
 prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.

MIC 2:7  O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD
 straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh
 uprightly?

MIC 2:8  Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe
 with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.

MIC 2:9  The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses;
 from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.

MIC 2:10  Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is
 polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.

MIC 2:11  If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will
 prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet
 of this people.

MIC 2:12  I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather
 the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as
 the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason
 of the multitude of men.

MIC 2:13  The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have
 passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass
 before them, and the LORD on the head of them.

MIC 3:1  And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the
 house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?

MIC 3:2  Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from
 off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

MIC 3:3  Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off
 them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the
 pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

MIC 3:4  Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will
 even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves
 ill in their doings.

MIC 3:5  Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err,
 that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into
 their mouths, they even prepare war against him.

MIC 3:6  Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision;
 and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go
 down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.

MIC 3:7  Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:
 yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.

MIC 3:8  But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of
 judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to
 Israel his sin.

MIC 3:9  Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes
 of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.

MIC 3:10  They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

MIC 3:11  The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for
 hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the
 LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.

MIC 3:12  Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and
 Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high
 places of the forest.

MIC 4:1  But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the
 house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it
 shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.

MIC 4:2  And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the
 mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach
 us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of
 Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

MIC 4:3  And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar
 off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into
 pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall
 they learn war any more.

MIC 4:4  But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;
 and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath
 spoken it.

MIC 4:5  For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will
 walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.

MIC 4:6  In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I
 will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;

MIC 4:7  And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far
 off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from
 henceforth, even for ever.

MIC 4:8  And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of
 Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall
 come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

MIC 4:9  Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy
 counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.

MIC 4:10  Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a
 woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt
 dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be
 delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.

MIC 4:11  Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be
 defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.

MIC 4:12  But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they
 his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.

MIC 4:13  Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn
 iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many
 people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance
 unto the Lord of the whole earth.

MIC 5:1  Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege
 against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.

MIC 5:2  But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
 thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be
 ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.

MIC 5:3  Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which
 travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return
 unto the children of Israel.

MIC 5:4  And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the
 majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall
 he be great unto the ends of the earth.

MIC 5:5  And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our
 land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him
 seven shepherds, and eight principal men.

MIC 5:6  And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land
 of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the
 Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our
 borders.

MIC 5:7  And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew
 from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor
 waiteth for the sons of men.

MIC 5:8  And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of
 many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among
 the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth
 in pieces, and none can deliver.

MIC 5:9  Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine
 enemies shall be cut off.

MIC 5:10  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will
 cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:

MIC 5:11  And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy
 strong holds:

MIC 5:12  And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have
 no more soothsayers:

MIC 5:13  Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out
 of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.

MIC 5:14  And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I
 destroy thy cities.

MIC 5:15  And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such
 as they have not heard.

MIC 6:1  Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the
 mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.

MIC 6:2  Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong
 foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his
 people, and he will plead with Israel.

MIC 6:3  O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied
 thee? testify against me.

MIC 6:4  For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out
 of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

MIC 6:5  O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what
 Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may
 know the righteousness of the LORD.

MIC 6:6  Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high
 God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?

MIC 6:7  Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands
 of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit
 of my body for the sin of my soul?

MIC 6:8  He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD
 require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with
 thy God?

MIC 6:9  The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see
 thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.

MIC 6:10  Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
 wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?

MIC 6:11  Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of
 deceitful weights?

MIC 6:12  For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants
 thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.

MIC 6:13  Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee
 desolate because of thy sins.

MIC 6:14  Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be
 in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and
 that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.

MIC 6:15  Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives,
 but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink
 wine.

MIC 6:16  For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of
 Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a
 desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear
 the reproach of my people.

MIC 7:1  Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as
 the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul
 desired the firstripe fruit.

MIC 7:2  The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright
 among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother
 with a net.

MIC 7:3  That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince
 asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his
 mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

MIC 7:4  The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a
 thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now shall be
 their perplexity.

MIC 7:5  Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the
 doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.

MIC 7:6  For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against
 her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies
 are the men of his own house.

MIC 7:7  Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my
 salvation: my God will hear me.

MIC 7:8  Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when
 I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.

MIC 7:9  I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against
 him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me
 forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.

MIC 7:10  Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her
 which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her:
 now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.

MIC 7:11  In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the
 decree be far removed.

MIC 7:12  In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from
 the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea
 to sea, and from mountain to mountain.

MIC 7:13  Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell
 therein, for the fruit of their doings.

MIC 7:14  Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which
 dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan
 and Gilead, as in the days of old.

MIC 7:15  According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I
 shew unto him marvellous things.

MIC 7:16  The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they
 shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.

MIC 7:17  They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their
 holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and
 shall fear because of thee.

MIC 7:18  Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by
 the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger
 for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.

MIC 7:19  He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue
 our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.

MIC 7:20  Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which
 thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.

NAH 1:1  The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

NAH 1:2  God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is
 furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth
 wrath for his enemies.

NAH 1:3  The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all
 acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the
 storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

NAH 1:4  He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers:
 Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.

NAH 1:5  The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is
 burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.

NAH 1:6  Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the
 fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are
 thrown down by him.

NAH 1:7  The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth
 them that trust in him.

NAH 1:8  But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place
 thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

NAH 1:9  What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end:
 affliction shall not rise up the second time.

NAH 1:10  For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are
 drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.

NAH 1:11  There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD,
 a wicked counsellor.

NAH 1:12  Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet
 thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have
 afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.

NAH 1:13  For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds
 in sunder.

NAH 1:14  And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more
 of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven
 image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.

NAH 1:15  Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings,
 that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for
 the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.

NAH 2:1  He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the
 munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.

NAH 2:2  For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the
 excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred
 their vine branches.

NAH 2:3  The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in
 scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his
 preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.

NAH 2:4  The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against
 another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like
 the lightnings.

NAH 2:5  He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they
 shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.

NAH 2:6  The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be
 dissolved.

NAH 2:7  And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her
 maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.

NAH 2:8  But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away.
 Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.

NAH 2:9  Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none
 end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture.

NAH 2:10  She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the
 knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them
 all gather blackness.

NAH 2:11  Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young
 lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and
 none made them afraid?

NAH 2:12  The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for
 his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.

NAH 2:13  Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn
 her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I
 will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall
 no more be heard.

NAH 3:1  Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey
 departeth not;

NAH 3:2  The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and
 of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.

NAH 3:3  The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering
 spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and
 there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:

NAH 3:4  Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured
 harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her
 whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.

NAH 3:5  Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will
 discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy
 nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

NAH 3:6  And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and
 will set thee as a gazingstock.

NAH 3:7  And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall
 flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence
 shall I seek comforters for thee?

NAH 3:8  Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers,
 that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall
 was from the sea?

NAH 3:9  Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and
 Lubim were thy helpers.

NAH 3:10  Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children
 also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots
 for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.

NAH 3:11  Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek
 strength because of the enemy.

NAH 3:12  All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs:
 if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.

NAH 3:13  Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy
 land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy
 bars.

NAH 3:14  Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into
 clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.

NAH 3:15  There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it
 shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm,
 make thyself many as the locusts.

NAH 3:16  Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the
 cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.

NAH 3:17  Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great
 grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun
 ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.

NAH 3:18  Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell
 in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth
 them.

NAH 3:19  There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that
 hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not
 thy wickedness passed continually?

OBA 1:1  The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We
 have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the
 heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.

OBA 1:2  Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly
 despised.

OBA 1:3  The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the
 clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who
 shall bring me down to the ground?

OBA 1:4  Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest
 among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.

OBA 1:5  If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!)
 would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came
 to thee, would they not leave some grapes?

OBA 1:6  How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things
 sought up!

OBA 1:7  All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border:
 the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed
 against thee; that they eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is
 none understanding in him.

OBA 1:8  Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out
 of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

OBA 1:9  And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every
 one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.

OBA 1:10  For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover
 thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

OBA 1:11  In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the
 strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his
 gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.

OBA 1:12  But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the
 day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the
 children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou
 have spoken proudly in the day of distress.

OBA 1:13  Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day
 of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction
 in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the
 day of their calamity;

OBA 1:14  Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those
 of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his
 that did remain in the day of distress.

OBA 1:15  For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast
 done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own
 head.

OBA 1:16  For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen
 drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and
 they shall be as though they had not been.

OBA 1:17  But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
 holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.

OBA 1:18  And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a
 flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and
 devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for
 the LORD hath spoken it.

OBA 1:19  And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they
 of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of
 Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.

OBA 1:20  And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall
 possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of
 Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.

OBA 1:21  And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau;
 and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.

ZEC 1:1  In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word
 of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the
 prophet, saying,

ZEC 1:2  The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.

ZEC 1:3  Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye
 unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of
 hosts.

ZEC 1:4  Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried,
 saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and
 from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the
 LORD.

ZEC 1:5  Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?

ZEC 1:6  But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the
 prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said,
 Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and
 according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.

ZEC 1:7  Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the
 month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto
 Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

ZEC 1:8  I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood
 among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red
 horses, speckled, and white.

ZEC 1:9  Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with
 me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.

ZEC 1:10  And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said,
 These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.

ZEC 1:11  And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle
 trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold,
 all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.

ZEC 1:12  Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how
 long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah,
 against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?

ZEC 1:13  And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words
 and comfortable words.

ZEC 1:14  So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying,
 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a
 great jealousy.

ZEC 1:15  And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for
 I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.

ZEC 1:16  Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with
 mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line
 shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.

ZEC 1:17  Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through
 prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort
 Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

ZEC 1:18  Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.

ZEC 1:19  And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he
 answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and
 Jerusalem.

ZEC 1:20  And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.

ZEC 1:21  Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are
 the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head:
 but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which
 lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.

ZEC 2:1  I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a
 measuring line in his hand.

ZEC 2:2  Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure
 Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length
 thereof.

ZEC 2:3  And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another
 angel went out to meet him,

ZEC 2:4  And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem
 shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle
 therein:

ZEC 2:5  For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round
 about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.

ZEC 2:6  Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the
 LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the
 LORD.

ZEC 2:7  Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.

ZEC 2:8  For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto
 the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of
 his eye.

ZEC 2:9  For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a
 spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent
 me.

ZEC 2:10  Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will
 dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.

ZEC 2:11  And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall
 be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that
 the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.

ZEC 2:12  And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and
 shall choose Jerusalem again.

ZEC 2:13  Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of
 his holy habitation.

ZEC 3:1  And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel
 of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.

ZEC 3:2  And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the
 LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out
 of the fire?

ZEC 3:3  Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the
 angel.

ZEC 3:4  And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying,
 Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have
 caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change
 of raiment.

ZEC 3:5  And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a
 fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the
 LORD stood by.

ZEC 3:6  And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,

ZEC 3:7  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if
 thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also
 keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand
 by.

ZEC 3:8  Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit
 before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my
 servant the BRANCH.

ZEC 3:9  For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone
 shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the
 LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.

ZEC 3:10  In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his
 neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.

ZEC 4:1  And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man
 that is wakened out of his sleep.

ZEC 4:2  And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and
 behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his
 seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the
 top thereof:

ZEC 4:3  And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and
 the other upon the left side thereof.

ZEC 4:4  So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What
 are these, my lord?

ZEC 4:5  Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest
 thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.

ZEC 4:6  Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the
 LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit,
 saith the LORD of hosts.

ZEC 4:7  Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a
 plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying,
 Grace, grace unto it.

ZEC 4:8  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

ZEC 4:9  The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his
 hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath
 sent me unto you.

ZEC 4:10  For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall
 rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those
 seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole
 earth.

ZEC 4:11  Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees
 upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?

ZEC 4:12  And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive
 branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out
 of themselves?

ZEC 4:13  And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I
 said, No, my lord.

ZEC 4:14  Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD
 of the whole earth.

ZEC 5:1  Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a
 flying roll.

ZEC 5:2  And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying
 roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten
 cubits.

ZEC 5:3  Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face
 of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this
 side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that
 side according to it.

ZEC 5:4  I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter
 into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely
 by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume
 it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.

ZEC 5:5  Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift
 up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.

ZEC 5:6  And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth
 forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth.

ZEC 5:7  And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman
 that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.

ZEC 5:8  And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the
 ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.

ZEC 5:9  Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out
 two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings
 of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.

ZEC 5:10  Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear
 the ephah?

ZEC 5:11  And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and
 it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.

ZEC 6:1  And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there
 came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were
 mountains of brass.

ZEC 6:2  In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black
 horses;

ZEC 6:3  And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot
 grisled and bay horses.

ZEC 6:4  Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are
 these, my lord?

ZEC 6:5  And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits
 of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the LORD of all the
 earth.

ZEC 6:6  The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country;
 and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south
 country.

ZEC 6:7  And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and
 fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through
 the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.

ZEC 6:8  Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that
 go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.

ZEC 6:9  And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

ZEC 6:10  Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of
 Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into
 the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;

ZEC 6:11  Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the
 head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;

ZEC 6:12  And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying,
 Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his
 place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:

ZEC 6:13  Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the
 glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon
 his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.

ZEC 6:14  And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and
 to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.

ZEC 6:15  And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the
 LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And
 this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD
 your God.

ZEC 7:1  And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word
 of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in
 Chisleu;

ZEC 7:2  When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and
 their men, to pray before the LORD,

ZEC 7:3  And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of
 hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month,
 separating myself, as I have done these so many years?

ZEC 7:4  Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,

ZEC 7:5  Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying,
 When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy
 years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?

ZEC 7:6  And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for
 yourselves, and drink for yourselves?

ZEC 7:7  Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former
 prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities
 thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain?

ZEC 7:8  And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,

ZEC 7:9  Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and
 shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:

ZEC 7:10  And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the
 poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.

ZEC 7:11  But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and
 stopped their ears, that they should not hear.

ZEC 7:12  Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should
 hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit
 by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.

ZEC 7:13  Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not
 hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:

ZEC 7:14  But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they
 knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through
 nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.

ZEC 8:1  Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,

ZEC 8:2  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great
 jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.

ZEC 8:3  Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the
 midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the
 mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.

ZEC 8:4  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women
 dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand
 for very age.

ZEC 8:5  And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing
 in the streets thereof.

ZEC 8:6  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the
 remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine
 eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.

ZEC 8:7  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the
 east country, and from the west country;

ZEC 8:8  And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem:
 and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in
 righteousness.

ZEC 8:9  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear
 in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day
 that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the
 temple might be built.

ZEC 8:10  For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for
 beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because
 of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.

ZEC 8:11  But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the
 former days, saith the LORD of hosts.

ZEC 8:12  For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and
 the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and
 I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.

ZEC 8:13  And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen,
 O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a
 blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.

ZEC 8:14  For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when
 your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented
 not:

ZEC 8:15  So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and
 to the house of Judah: fear ye not.

ZEC 8:16  These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth
 to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:

ZEC 8:17  And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
 neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate,
 saith the LORD.

ZEC 8:18  And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,

ZEC 8:19  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the
 fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth,
 shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts;
 therefore love the truth and peace.

ZEC 8:20  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there
 shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:

ZEC 8:21  And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us
 go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go
 also.

ZEC 8:22  Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of
 hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.

ZEC 8:23  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass,
 that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall
 take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for
 we have heard that God is with you.

ZEC 9:1  The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and
 Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the
 tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.

ZEC 9:2  And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be
 very wise.

ZEC 9:3  And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the
 dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.

ZEC 9:4  Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the
 sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.

ZEC 9:5  Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very
 sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king
 shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.

ZEC 9:6  And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride
 of the Philistines.

ZEC 9:7  And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations
 from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our
 God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

ZEC 9:8  And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him
 that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall
 pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.

ZEC 9:9  Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem:
 behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation;
 lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.

ZEC 9:10  And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from
 Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto
 the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the
 river even to the ends of the earth.

ZEC 9:11  As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy
 prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.

ZEC 9:12  Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I
 declare that I will render double unto thee;

ZEC 9:13  When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and
 raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the
 sword of a mighty man.

ZEC 9:14  And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as
 the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with
 whirlwinds of the south.

ZEC 9:15  The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and
 subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through
 wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar.

ZEC 9:16  And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of
 his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an
 ensign upon his land.

ZEC 9:17  For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn
 shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.

ZEC 10:1  Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD
 shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass
 in the field.

ZEC 10:2  For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a
 lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went
 their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.

ZEC 10:3  Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the
 goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and
 hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.

ZEC 10:4  Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the
 battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.

ZEC 10:5  And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies
 in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the
 LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.

ZEC 10:6  And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house
 of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon
 them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD
 their God, and will hear them.

ZEC 10:7  And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall
 rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their
 heart shall rejoice in the LORD.

ZEC 10:8  I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and
 they shall increase as they have increased.

ZEC 10:9  And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in
 far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.

ZEC 10:10  I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather
 them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and
 Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.

ZEC 10:11  And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite
 the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the
 pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart
 away.

ZEC 10:12  And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and
 down in his name, saith the LORD.

ZEC 11:1  Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.

ZEC 11:2  Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are
 spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come
 down.

ZEC 11:3  There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is
 spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is
 spoiled.

ZEC 11:4  Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;

ZEC 11:5  Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they
 that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own
 shepherds pity them not.

ZEC 11:6  For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD:
 but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into
 the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I
 will not deliver them.

ZEC 11:7  And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the
 flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other
 I called Bands; and I fed the flock.

ZEC 11:8  Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed
 them, and their soul also abhorred me.

ZEC 11:9  Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and
 that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one
 the flesh of another.

ZEC 11:10  And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might
 break my covenant which I had made with all the people.

ZEC 11:11  And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that
 waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.

ZEC 11:12  And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if
 not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.

ZEC 11:13  And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price
 that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and
 cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.

ZEC 11:14  Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break
 the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

ZEC 11:15  And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a
 foolish shepherd.

ZEC 11:16  For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not
 visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that
 that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh
 of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.

ZEC 11:17  Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be
 upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and
 his right eye shall be utterly darkened.

ZEC 12:1  The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which
 stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and
 formeth the spirit of man within him.

ZEC 12:2  Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people
 round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against
 Jerusalem.

ZEC 12:3  And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
 people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all
 the people of the earth be gathered together against it.

ZEC 12:4  In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with
 astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the
 house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.

ZEC 12:5  And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants
 of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.

ZEC 12:6  In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire
 among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour
 all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem
 shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.

ZEC 12:7  The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory
 of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not
 magnify themselves against Judah.

ZEC 12:8  In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and
 he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of
 David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.

ZEC 12:9  And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy
 all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

ZEC 12:10  And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of
 Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon
 me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for
 his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in
 bitterness for his firstborn.

ZEC 12:11  In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the
 mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.

ZEC 12:12  And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the
 house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of
 Nathan apart, and their wives apart;

ZEC 12:13  The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the
 family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

ZEC 12:14  All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives
 apart.

ZEC 13:1  In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David
 and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.

ZEC 13:2  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that
 I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more
 be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to
 pass out of the land.

ZEC 13:3  And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his
 father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live;
 for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother
 that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.

ZEC 13:4  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be
 ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they
 wear a rough garment to deceive:

ZEC 13:5  But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught
 me to keep cattle from my youth.

ZEC 13:6  And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands?
 Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my
 friends.

ZEC 13:7  Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my
 fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be
 scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.

ZEC 13:8  And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two
 parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.

ZEC 13:9  And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine
 them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall
 call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they
 shall say, The LORD is my God.

ZEC 14:1  Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided
 in the midst of thee.

ZEC 14:2  For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the
 city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half
 of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people
 shall not be cut off from the city.

ZEC 14:3  Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as
 when he fought in the day of battle.

ZEC 14:4  And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which
 is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the
 midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very
 great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and
 half of it toward the south.

ZEC 14:5  And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley
 of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled
 from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD
 my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.

ZEC 14:6  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be
 clear, nor dark:

ZEC 14:7  But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day,
 nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.

ZEC 14:8  And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from
 Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the
 hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.

ZEC 14:9  And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall
 there be one LORD, and his name one.

ZEC 14:10  All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of
 Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from
 Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and
 from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses.

ZEC 14:11  And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter
 destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.

ZEC 14:12  And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the
 people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away
 while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their
 holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.

ZEC 14:13  And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the
 LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of
 his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.

ZEC 14:14  And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the
 heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and
 apparel, in great abundance.

ZEC 14:15  And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the
 camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as
 this plague.

ZEC 14:16  And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the
 nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to
 worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.

ZEC 14:17  And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families
 of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon
 them shall be no rain.

ZEC 14:18  And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no
 rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen
 that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

ZEC 14:19  This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all
 nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

ZEC 14:20  In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS
 UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house shall be like the bowls
 before the altar.

ZEC 14:21  Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the
 LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and
 seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the
 house of the LORD of hosts.

ZEP 1:1  The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the
 son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of
 Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

ZEP 1:2  I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the LORD.

ZEP 1:3  I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the
 heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked:
 and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.

ZEP 1:4  I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this
 place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;

ZEP 1:5  And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them
 that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;

ZEP 1:6  And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not
 sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.

ZEP 1:7  Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the
 LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his
 guests.

ZEP 1:8  And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice, that I
 will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed
 with strange apparel.

ZEP 1:9  In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the
 threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.

ZEP 1:10  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that there
 shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the
 second, and a great crashing from the hills.

ZEP 1:11  Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut
 down; all they that bear silver are cut off.

ZEP 1:12  And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem
 with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say
 in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.

ZEP 1:13  Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a
 desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they
 shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.

ZEP 1:14  The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly,
 even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there
 bitterly.

ZEP 1:15  That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of
 wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds
 and thick darkness,

ZEP 1:16  A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against
 the high towers.

ZEP 1:17  And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind
 men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be
 poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.

ZEP 1:18  Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them
 in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the
 fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them
 that dwell in the land.

ZEP 2:1  Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not
 desired;

ZEP 2:2  Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff,
 before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the
 LORD's anger come upon you.

ZEP 2:3  Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his
 judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the
 day of the LORD's anger.

ZEP 2:4  For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall
 drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.

ZEP 2:5  Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the
 Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the
 Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.

ZEP 2:6  And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and
 folds for flocks.

ZEP 2:7  And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they
 shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the
 evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their
 captivity.

ZEP 2:8  I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children
 of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves
 against their border.

ZEP 2:9  Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
 Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even
 the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the
 residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall
 possess them.

ZEP 2:10  This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached
 and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts.

ZEP 2:11  The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods
 of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all
 the isles of the heathen.

ZEP 2:12  Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.

ZEP 2:13  And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy
 Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness.

ZEP 2:14  And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the
 nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels
 of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the
 thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work.

ZEP 2:15  This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her
 heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a
 place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss,
 and wag his hand.

ZEP 3:1  Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!

ZEP 3:2  She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not
 in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.

ZEP 3:3  Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening
 wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

ZEP 3:4  Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have
 polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.

ZEP 3:5  The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every
 morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust
 knoweth no shame.

ZEP 3:6  I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their
 streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that
 there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.

ZEP 3:7  I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so
 their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they
 rose early, and corrupted all their doings.

ZEP 3:8  Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise
 up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may
 assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce
 anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.

ZEP 3:9  For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all
 call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.

ZEP 3:10  From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter
 of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.

ZEP 3:11  In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein
 thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst
 of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty
 because of my holy mountain.

ZEP 3:12  I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
 people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.

ZEP 3:13  The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither
 shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie
 down, and none shall make them afraid.

ZEP 3:14  Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with
 all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

ZEP 3:15  The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy:
 the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not
 see evil any more.

ZEP 3:16  In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to
 Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.

ZEP 3:17  The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he
 will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over
 thee with singing.

ZEP 3:18  I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who
 are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.

ZEP 3:19  Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will
 save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get
 them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.

ZEP 3:20  At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather
 you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth,
 when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.
