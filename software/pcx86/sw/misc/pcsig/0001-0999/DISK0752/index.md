## Information about "THE BRAIN"

    With your modem and telecommunications program, you call up the local
    and national bulletin board systems to download files and pick up your
    mail.  But sometimes the lines are busy and you won't have time to call
    later.  Don't worry.  Have THE BRAIN make those calls for you.
    
    THE BRAIN is a telecommunications program that accesses your favorite
    BBS or on-line service when you're not there.  Upload and download
    files, leave messages, and generally perform any routine tasks you
    don't want to take the time to do yourself.  THE BRAIN can also call a
    BBS when it is easier to get on-line, such as late at night or during
    the day while you're at work.
    
    Suitable for the intermediate to expert user, the documentation
    assumes that you are familiar with DOS, have a text editor and know how
    to use it, and know how to program your modem.  The manual has a
    glossary of commands (with detailed descriptions and brief examples of
    each) and a sample command file.
