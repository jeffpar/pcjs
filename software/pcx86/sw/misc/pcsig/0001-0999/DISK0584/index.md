## Information about "MISCELLANEOUS 123 WORKSHEETS"

    This disk contains a variety of spreadsheets, ranging from printing
    utilities to common financial applications (loan amortization,
    checkbook manager, etc.).  Included is the demo version of Toolkit and
    ACII driver, with mathematical calculators for solving triangles,
    creating ASCII tables and more.  Another math spreadsheet performs
    polynomial regressions.  Miscellaneous utilities allow default colors
    to be changed, the preparation of using chronological dates as column
    titles, intructions for using PRTGRAPH.COM to generate special fonts,
    etc.  There are also worksheets for time management, mail list database
