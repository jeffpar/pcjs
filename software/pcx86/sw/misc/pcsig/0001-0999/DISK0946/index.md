## Information about "BASKETBALL SIMULATION"

    BASKETBALL is a text-based simulation of basketball -- not an
    interactive computer game.  Once you have chosen the teams and players,
    the game begins and you are a spectator.
    
    As play proceeds, the radio announcer's dialogue rolls across the
    screen.  If you enjoy listening to games on the radio, you will enjoy
    this game!  Rather than trying to capture the physical representation of
    basketball on the PC, this program effectively brings the thrill of the
    game to you the same way the radio sports announcer does.
    
    The program comes with data for six teams: the Celtics, the Lakers, the
    Rockets, the '76ers, and the East and West All-Star teams.  Play games
    with any combination of these teams or create teams of your own.

PC-SIG version 1.1

BASKETBALL is a text-based simulation of basketball.  This is not an
interactive computer game.  Once you have choosen the teams and players
and the game begins, you are a spectator: as gameplay proceeds, the
radio announcer's dialogue rolls across the screen.  And if you enjoy
listening to games played over the radio, you will enjoy this game!
Rather than trying to capture the physical characteristics of basketball
on the PC, this program effectively brings the thrill of the game to you
the same way the radio sports announcer does.

The program comes with data for six teams: the Celtics, the Lakers, the
Rockets, the '76ers, and the East and West All-Star teams.  You can play
games using any combination of these teams.  Output can be sent to your
printer, if you would like to examine the game after it has been played,
by using the CTRL-PRTSC combination before play begins.  You can also
create teams of your own from within the program.
