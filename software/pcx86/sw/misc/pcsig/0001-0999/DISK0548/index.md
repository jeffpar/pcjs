## Information about "LETUS A-B-C #11"

    Letus A-B-C is a database in PC-FILE III format containing references
    to articles in six major PC oriented magazines, beginning with
    1982.  This release of Letus A-B-C covers the following five
    magazines devoted to the IBM PC: PC Magazine (PCMAG), PC Tech
    Journal (PCTEC), Business Computing (BCOMP), PC Professional
    (PCPRO), and Byte Magazine (BYTE). This database provides the PC
    user with a tool for easily performing literature searches at a
    very nominal cost in one's office or home. The search is done by
    keyword fields as well as identification fields (i.e., author, title,
    magazine issue, and page); also, the authors have included three lines
    that give a general description of the article.
    
    System Requirements:   128k, 2 disk drives, PC-FILE III (Disk No 5)
    
    How to Start: It is very important to read the Documentation file
    (Letus.doc) located on disk #350 either by screening it (entering TYPE
    LETUS.DOC at the A> and using CTRL-S to pause it) or accessing it with
    your word processor.  To run it, "boot-up" the DOS system and put PC-
    FILE system disk in drive A; enter PC-FILE <CR>.  PC-FILE will ask
    where the database is; you will have put Letus A-B-C Disk #11 in drive
    "B", so you will enter B:LETUS <CR>.  The various files on this
    diskette, corresponding to magazine and year, will be displayed on the
    screen for your selection.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $10.00 per disk.
