## Information about "WIZQUIZ AND JEM"

    WIZQUIZ is an educational program that offers randomly-generated
    problems across a wide area of the average elementary school
    mathematics curriculum including such disciplines as addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division, lowest common denominator,
    greatest common factor, simple and advanced fractions, decimals and
    percentages, and reciprocals.
    
    Each type of problem has 10 levels with a target score determined by
    the number of errors and the time it takes to solve all 10 problems of
    that level. Since WIZQUIZ asks for and remembers a player's age, it
    restricts access to easier problems by age.
    
    After each set of 10 problems, the program calculates the new average,
    checks the score against the best ever and the player's own previous
    best performance, and announces the score. WIZQUIZ keeps a separate
    record for each player's best score and averages.
    
    WIZQUIZ can be used both at home for personal studying and at school in
    the classroom.
    
    JEM LOGO was written to teach children the basics of computer
    programming. A very simple programming language, it teaches children
    the logic associated with a computer and how to combine commands to
    carry out complex tasks.
    
    JEM has three basic modes: Help, Explain, and Run. The first mode you
    see is Run, when the logos are displayed. If you type Help, you get
    four pages of text, giving a brief description of the logo or word you
    indicated when you requested help.
