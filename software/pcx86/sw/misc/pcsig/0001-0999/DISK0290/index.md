## Information about "FITT TAX WORKSHEETS"

    A Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet to help you simplify the preparation of your
    Federal Income Tax Return.  You don't have to be a Lotus 1-2-3 expert
    to take advantage of FITT.
    
    Three new forms have been included with the most recent version:
    
    ~ Form 2210 - Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals and
    Fiduciaries
    
    ~ Form 1116 - Computation of Foreign Tax Credit
    
    ~ Form 8615 - Computation of Tax for Children Under Age 14 Who Have
    Investment Income of More Than $1,000
    
    Forms 1040 and 2441, Schedules A, B, C, D, E, G and W can also be
    produced.  In addition to the official IRS forms and schedules, FITT
    includes a number of the worksheets that appear within the Form 1040
    instruction package, such as:
    
    ~ Taxable Refunds of State and Local Income Taxes, Social Security
    Benefits
    
    ~ IRA Worksheets 1 and 2, Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction
    
    ~ Schedule SE Worksheet
    
    Fill in the blanks on the screen forms and FITT automatically performs
    all the calculations, comparisons, table look-ups and other required
    checks and cross-references.
