## Information about "COMMUNICATION UTILTIES #1"

    This disk contains a collection of popular, public domain communication
    utilities and a list of IBM-PC oriented BBS's.  Most are oriented to
    the Hayes Smartmodem command set.  HC.COM is a Hex File converter which
    converts to and from HEX format.  It can automatically provide a COM or
    EXE extension.  NUSQ-11.COM is a utility for expanding squeezed files
    to their original uncompressed state.  Two separate versions of NUSQ
    are available, one for CP/M-86 and one for the MS-DOS operating system.
    PCTERM.ASM is a simple terminal program which uses interrupt driven
    buffered communications.  The program can thus operated at 9600 baud
    without losing data.
    
    System Requirements: Serial port, modem
    
    How to Start: Review documentation in the .DOC and .TXT files.  To run
    any program with the suffix .COM or .EXE, just type its filename,
    i.e., for SQPC.EXE type SQPC and press <ENTER>.  To run the BASIC
    programs follow the GETTING STARTED instructions for your
    configuration.
