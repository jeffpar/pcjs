## Information about "THE CONFIDANT"

    The Confidant is a user-supported program which encodes sensitive data
    in order to keep it confidential.  The Confidant protects information
    transmitted by communications lines from alteration as well as from
    unauthorized use by anyone intercepting it or trying to change it.
    The Confidant gives a choice of two encryption procedures.  The
    national Data Encryption Standard (DES) provides very high security.
    A faster "privacy" procedure that is somewhat less secure provides
    encryption for normal use, where speed is important.
    
    System Requirements:  2 disk drives
    
    How to Start: Consult the voluminous documentation in the four files
    marked .DOC.  Initiate the program by typing CONFIDE at the DOS prompt.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $10.00
