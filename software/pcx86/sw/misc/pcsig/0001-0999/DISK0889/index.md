## Information about "FAMTRAK AND DOS-PRO"

    FAMTRACK is an effective management tool designed to make the
    unpleasant task of family budgeting -- if not fun -- survivable and
    profitable. It will accommodate every type of financial transaction
    common to modern families.
    
    Produce screen or printed records of monthly and year-to-date
    performance in 40 different budget categories for both husband and wife.
    It can handle as many as 20 separate financial accounts -- checking,
    savings, bank cards or charge accounts -- and will reconcile each
    account at statement time. The payment activity for as many as 21
    payees or income sources can also be tracked.
    
    Menu-driven FAMTRACK can automatically reconcile your checkbook at any
    time during the month or whenever bank statements are issued. A
    database of all financial transactions is maintained and there is an
    automatic year-end closing procedure and data storage.
    
    One of the most useful features of FAMTRACK is its loans calculator. You
    can easily calculate mortgage amortization, future values, present
    values, interest rates, payoff times, effective annual rates, and
    doubling times for any compounding period. These tools are extremely
    valuable in comparing different credit options when purchasing homes,
    automobiles, furniture, or other major items.
    
    Take real financial control and plan your future.
    
    DOS-PRO is a menu-driven utility that lists the most commonly used DOS
    commands and is very helpful to novice users. Select the command you
    want to use with the cursor. If you are unfamiliar with the use of
    that specific DOS command, an on-line help function is ready to
    explain it to you. DOS-PRO's menu occupies only one screen, and is
    divided into directory commands, format commands, and other DOS
    commands.
