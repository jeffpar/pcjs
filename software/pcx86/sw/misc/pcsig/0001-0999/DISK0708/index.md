## Information about "BACKGAMMON AND MORE"

    Norsoft FOREIGN LANGUAGE HANGMAN is an excellent educational program for
    learning Spanish, or for learning English for people who speak Spanish.
    While being educational, this program is very entertaining.  It includes
    three variations on the basic Hangman game.  The first is guessing what
    the secret word is, while in the second version you must guess an entire
    phrase.  The last is Personalized Hangman, which can be played by two to
    nine players who enter a word or phrase to try to stump the others.
    This program is quite useful for building up your vocabulary or for
    learning basic grammar.
    
    BACKGAMMON is finally here for your PC!  Now you can play against a
    strong opponent on your own computer.  If you've never played before, or
    you're the champion of your local club, BACKGAMMON will fill the role of
    instant opponent.  For the true afficionado, the program keeps track of
    points, games, gammons, and backgammons.
