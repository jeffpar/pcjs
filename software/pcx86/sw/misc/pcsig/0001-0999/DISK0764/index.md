## Information about "COMPASS DESKTOP MANAGER"

    COMPASS is the first integrated program that combines six major
    programs and utilities into one program. It has the following
    modules:
    
    ~ Database -- A full-fledged database you can use to add, change
    and delete information.
    
    ~ Word processing -- A functional word processor with all the abilities
    you'd expect to find: automatic word-wrapping, text block editing,
    utilities, and more.
    
    ~ Spreadsheet -- A complete spreadsheet program, with 315 cells (A-G
    columns, 1-45 rows) that should meet any small to medium
    calculating needs you have.
    
    ~ Accounting -- A built-in, single-entry accounting package that can
    track up to 999 different income and expense sources, give you a
    month-to-date and year-to-date report, and show balances by account
    number. It has three report statements (an account number listing, a
    monthly transaction report, and an income statement), and an
    easy-to-use, end-of-period processing utility.
    
    ~ Calendar -- A module to keep track of all your appointments on
    your schedule, displaying them either by day or by month.
    
    ~ Names -- A built-in mailing list program
    
    ~ Utilities -- A set of five major built-in utilities: list empty disk
    space available, show a directory of the disk, copy files from one disk
    to another, run other programs without leaving COMPASS, and set up the
    parameters of COMPASS.
    
    COMPASS is the perfect program for the lap-top computer user on the go.
    It is easy to use, runs from one floppy disk, and is completely self-
    contained. Great for beginners!
