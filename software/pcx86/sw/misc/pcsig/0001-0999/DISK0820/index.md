## Information about "SEEKEASY"

    SEEKEASY is a very easy-to-use, ``flexible match'' information-
    retrieval program which lets you search a text file for a character
    string and lists the ``best matches'' to your request in the order of
    match quality. It can do this even if the item found is not exactly
    what you requested, or has words in it that were not in your request,
    or doesn't use words spelled exactly the same way.  Because of the
    flexibility of the program, it can be used for a multitude of uses,
    both for personal and business needs.
