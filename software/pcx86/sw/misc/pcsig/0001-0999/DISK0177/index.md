## Information about "ARCADE SERIES 1"

    The first in a series of disks which display some of the best, in our
    opinion, of the games we have to offer in the library.  For a good
    test of your heart rate, try to find the BOMB before it explodes.  Or
    battle the vicious BUGS!  JUMPJOE is a real test of your reflexes, and
    BREAKOUT is always a popular offering.  After all that, grab your
    PENCIL and sketch your cares away.
