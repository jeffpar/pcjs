## Information about "COST EFFECTIVE TRACKING SYSTEM"

    Are you having a hard time figuring the cost of that construction job?
    COST EFFECTIVE is here to help you out. COST EFFECTIVE keeps track of
    your raw materials and their prices. When you have a job to do, you
    tell the program what you will be needing and COST EFFECTIVE will tell
    you what the price will be.
    
    Raw materials are never going to be the same price from day to day, this
    why COST EFFECTIVE also allows you to enter new prices for your raw
    materials and get a new estimate. Reports like raw materials listings a
    prices can be printed from the program.
    
    The program is fully menu-driven and there are help screens available at
    any point in the program. You will find COST EFFECTIVE a great asset
    your company if raw materials are a part of your productions.
