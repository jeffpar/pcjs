## Information about "HYDROFLO DEMO VERSION"

    This is a demo version of HDROFLO with two sample problems.  HYDROFLO
    performs the functions of a hydraulic system calculator.  The design
    engineer essentially works in a worksheet-type environment, analyzing
    hydraulic elements and observing the bottom line effects.  HYDROFLO's
    calculations can be done in English or metric units and use any type of
    fluid.  HYDROFLO can prescribe a pump for a system to meet a specified
    flow and determine possible cavitation situations.  This demo is a
    working version in that your own hydraulic calculations can be performed
    and verified.  Full screen graphics of the system and pump operation are
    accessible along with full report functions.  The full-featured version
    includes other functions where, with a single command, the entire
    systems diameter or friction can be changed to a new value and the
    systems new operating point and pump specification be determined.
    HYDROFLO automatically uses fitting and valve friction coefficients from
    menus, and help is available anywhere in the program.
    
    Special Requirements:  None.
