## Information about "MINISTER'S SERMON INDEXER"

    MINISTER'S SERMON INDEXER is a simple database designed with the
    pastor in mind. Keep track of previous sermons as well as the date and
    location they were given. Store the title, subject, and scriptural
    references. A field is provided for a five-digit reference number, so
    you can refer to the text file where the actual sermon is stored.
    
    The MINISTER'S SERMON INDEXER does not do anything that cannot be done
    with most available databases; however, it does have an excellent user
    interface. Also featured are pull-down menus accessed by your cursor
    control keys. The documentation is very good, although the program is
    so easy to use it is hardly needed.
