## Information about "LETUS A-B-C #12"

    Letus A-B-C is a database in PC-FILE III format containing references
    to articles in six major PC oriented magazines, beginning with 1982.
    This release of Letus A-B-C covers the following three magazines
    devoted to the IBM PC: PCjr World (PCJRW), Programmers Journal (PJ),
    and PC Week (PCWK).  This database provides the PC user with a tool for
    easily performing literature searches at a very nominal cost in one's
    office or home.  The search is done by keyword fields as well as
    identification fields (i.e., author, title, magazine issue, and page);
    also, the authors have included three lines that give a general
    description of the article.
    
    System Requirements:   128k, 2 disk drives, PC-FILE III (Disk No 5)
    
    How to Start: It is very important to read the Documentation file
    (Letus.doc) located on disk #350 either by screening it (entering TYPE
    LETUS.DOC at the A> and using CTRL-S to pause it) or accessing it with
    your word processor.  To run it, "boot-up" the DOS system and put PC-
    FILE system disk in drive A; enter PC-FILE <CR>.  PC-FILE will ask
    where the database is; you will have put Letus A-B-C Disk #12 in drive
    "B", so you will enter B:LETUS <CR>.  The various files on this
    diskette, corresponding to magazine and year, will be displayed on the
    screen for your selection.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $10.00 per disk.
