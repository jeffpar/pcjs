## Information about "INFOBASE"

    Infobase is a forms-driven database management system with mailmerge
    capabilities and is similar in function and capability to Info-Star
    and Versa Form.  Infobase is forms driven; that is you create forms
    that match preprinted forms (e.g., IRS forms).  These forms can then
    be used to create databases or access databases created by other
    forms.
    
    Features:
    
    ~ Comprehensive help messages and instructions on the screen.
    ~ Searching on any field.
    ~ Multiple FORMS per DATABASE.
    ~ Multiple-page FORMS.
    ~ Two DATABASES open concurrently.
    ~ DATA verification.
    ~ DATA entry power to support high volume operators.
    ~ Multiple record formats per DATABASE.
    ~ Mailmerging including full text readjustment.
    ~ Select subsets of records for special processing.
    ~ Sort RECORDS into any order.
    
    System Requirements: Two disk drives
