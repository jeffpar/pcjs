## Information about "LETTERWRITER"

    LETTERWRITER is a different kind of address manager -- its specialty is
    mailmerge.  You can keep address files full of different ``kinds'' of
    people; i.e., business acquaintances, friends, or relatives.  You can
    sort these different files by first name, last name, or zip code, just
    as you would a more traditional database address manager.
    
    But with LETTERWRITER you can also merge the database information into
    an ASCII document, such as a letter that has been created in a
    wordprocessor.  In this way you can imbed names, phrases, or paragraphs
    into the body of a letter.  And you can create form letters by simply
    typing out one letter you want to send to any number of different
    addresses and specifying those addresses.  LETTERWRITER automatically
    prints a letter with each address.  It can also print labels, envelopes,
    address books, and lots more.
