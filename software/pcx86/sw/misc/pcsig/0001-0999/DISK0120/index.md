## Information about "PC-CHESS"

    This program lets you play chess against the computer or a human
    opponent. The level of the computer's chess games are not particularly
    difficult, so it is not a challenge for experts.  But when competing
    against human opponents, the program can store up to 26 games in-
    progress.
    
    The graphics of the game only appear on systems using either EGA or CGA
    adapter cards. The program uses ASCII characters to depict the chess
    pieces on a monochrome or Hercules graphics systems.
