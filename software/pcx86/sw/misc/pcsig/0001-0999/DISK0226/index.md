## Information about "FREECOPY"

    FREECOPY is a disk utility that is functionally equivalent to DISKCOPY
    which is distributed with IBM PC DOS. FREECOPY simply replaces
    MS-DOS's DISKCOPY, but written better and runs faster.  The author
    has encouraged your "improving" it by placing the source code here.
    
    The four major files are: FREECOPY.COM is the executable code in a
    binary .COM file in machine-readable format; FREECOPY.ASM contains the
    source code in structured assembly language with lots of comments;
    FREECOPY.MAP is an Assembler map listing; and FREECOPY.DOC contains a
    users guide.
    
    How to Start: Read documentation in FREECOPY.DOC.  To run, type
    FREECOPY from the prompt and answer all questions.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $25.00
    
    File Descriptions:
