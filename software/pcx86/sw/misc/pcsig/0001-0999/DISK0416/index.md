## Information about "ROFF4"

    A complete and well documented version of ROFF with test and sample
    files.  This formatter contains features important for the preparation
    of technical  manuscripts.  Special symbols or fonts that can be
    defined by or for the user can be produced (if the hardware is
    capable!).  Super and subscripts can be handled as well as backspace
    even for printers without reverse scrolling or backspacing hardware
    capabilities.
    
    Using ROFF4, you can make nice printouts of a file, with as little or
    as much help from the program as you want, depending on the commands.
    There are default values for all parameters; so if you don't put any
    commands in at all, your file will come out with filled, right-
    justified lines.
    
    System Requirements:  128K, one disk drive and a monochrome display
    
    How to Start: To read the manual on screen, enter: ROFF4 ROFF4.DOC
    To print the manual, type: ROFF4 ROFF4.DOC+.  To run, enter ROFF4.
