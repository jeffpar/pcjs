## Information about "PROGRAMERS UTILITIES #5"

    This disk contains 2 BASIC utilities, a LOTUS 1-2-3 utility, and a DOS
    tool. 123PREP allows you to quickly create a properly formatted input
    file for 1-2-3's IMPORT feature.  AID will reduce or eliminate
    repetitive steps which are usually required in the creating, editing,
    and using of BASIC programs.  SCREENIN provides the BASIC programmer
    with a customizable, generalized screen input program which will
    reduce duplication of BASIC code from program to program (very useful
    if all your programs require some input from the user).  W20 is a
    mini-DOS manager which presents the user with a menu of standard DOS
    file functions (copy, delete, print, etc.) and each file in the
    directory (sorted alphabetically).
    
    System Requirements: BASIC;  Lotus 1-2-3 or clone.
    
    How to Start: Consult the .DOC and README files for directions
    and documentation. To run the BASIC programs, consult the
    directions in GETTING STARTED for your configuration. To run a
    program with the suffix .COM or .EXE, just type its name, i.e.,
    for 123PREP.EXE, type 123PREP <ENTER>.
