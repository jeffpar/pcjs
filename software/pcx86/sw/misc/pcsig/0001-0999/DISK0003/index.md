## Information about "RATBAS"

    If you're an advanced Basic programmer, RATBAS could be just what
    you're looking for. It allows basic programs to be written in a more
    structured way without line numbers. Programs written in Rationalized
    BASIC are converted into standard BASIC by the RATBAS translator. In
    effect, RATBAS is a translation program that takes your RATional BASic
    programs and converts them to Standard BASIC. It forms the bridge
    between Pascal-like Rational BASIC and standard BASIC by making the
    conversion process easier. Note, this is not a version of BASIC, but an
    adjunct.
