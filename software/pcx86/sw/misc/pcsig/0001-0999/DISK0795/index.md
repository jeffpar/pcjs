## Information about "BULLET SIMULATOR DEMO VERSION"

    If you are into high-performance shooting, BULLET SIMULATOR is a program
    you can't afford to be without.  BULLET SIMULATOR helps you understand,
    predict and optimize the ballistic performance of your rifles.  This
    program is based on a mathematical model of bullet flight which accounts
    for just about any variable you can imagine.
    
    The following variables are included: bullet make, diameter, weight,
    shape, ballistic coefficient, powder charge, muzzle velocity, rifle
    weight, sight line height, rifle and your accuracy, temperature,
    elevation above sea level, wind conditions, hill slope, vital target
    height, target running speed and zero range.  The model is evaluated
    over a range of distances that you specify in either yards or meters.
    
    Once you run a simulation, you can view as a table or graph the
    following results: Remaining velocity, kinetic energy, sustained lead,
    wind drift and trajectory.  Recoil, maximum effective range and
    point-blank range are also calculated.  You can perform an optimal zero
    range analysis to maximize the point-blank range and reduce the chance
    of missing targets.
    
    Use the field simulation option to understand your load like the back of
    your hand.  With your choice of range, hill slope and wind conditions,
    you position crosshairs on game and silhouette graphics images where you
    think the shot should be taken.  The bullet's impact is shown along with
    the ideal crosshair hold.  BULLET SIMULATOR also plays a game, creating
    random situations and keeping score of your hits and misses.  A great
    training tool!
    
    A pop-up help system is available throughout the program.  This version
    of BULLET SIMULATOR is a working demo version.  It provides all the
    features of the registered version, but with a single bullet to give you
    a complete idea of its capabilities.  The registeUred version uses the
    library of over 500 bullets that you can edit to add any new bullets,
    complete with a ballistic coefficient calculator.
    
    System Requirements:  320K memory.
    
    How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).
