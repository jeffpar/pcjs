## Information about "BIORHYTHM MONTHLY SCHEDULE PROGRAM"

    Many people believe that the human body experiences a number of cycles
    every month or so.  Three major cycles run simultaneously but have
    differing periods so that one cycle may be expressing the beginning of a
    curve while another will be at the peak of its own curve at the same
    time.  It is believed that the overlapping and timing of these cycles or
    curves can be used to predict how you will perform in the future.
    
    BIO can calculate these biorhythm cycles for any person born after the
    year 1753.  The physical, emotional and intellectual cycles are marked
    by letters in columns for each day of the month, each letter showing how
    high or low that particular cycle is.  An asterisk indicates a critical
    day for that cycle.
    
    BIOCOMP.EXE compares the biorhythms of two persons, and will display
    the percentage of compatibility for each cycle.
