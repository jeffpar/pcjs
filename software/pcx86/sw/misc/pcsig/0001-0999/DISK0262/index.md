     4. Get the golf course list.  This is where you add, change and
        delete golf courses that you will be playing.  You enter in-
        formation about par, course rating and hole handicaps.  You
        also review the golf course information here.  The course list
        holds nine courses.

     Adding courses  to the course list  is the first thing to be done
in getting ready to use PC-GOLF.   Use the ADD option for this. After
you have added a course to the list you must check the information for
accuracy.  Use the REVIEW option to display all the course information.
Use the CHANGE option to correct any errors.  The benefits of PC-GOLF
depend directly upon accurate pars, hole handicaps and course ratings.

     You will need a scorecard for each course you add to the course
list.  The scorecard contains the detailed course information for
men's and ladies tees, pars and handicaps.  You will also need the
course ratings for each course you add.  Official course ratings are
assigned for each set of tees on the course.  Some courses have as
many as four sets of tees; GOLD, BLUE, WHITE and RED.  Get the course
rating for each set of tees on the course you are adding to the list.
They are available from the pro-shop.

     PC-GOLF will help you improve your golf game.  The program
is easy to use and understand.  It is a very friendly program.
PC-GOLF is written especially for the amateur golfer and for the
IBM Personal Computer.  Use it with confidence that it will help
raise your level of achievement and enjoyment on the course.
     
     Player performance is the primary subject of the program. It
keeps track of your scores and your putts for each hole on your
home  course.  It shows you  how you are doing  on each hole.
PC-GOLF helps you concentrate on the main event so you can see
where  improvement  is most desirable and  most likely to be
achieved.  It will even  mark the holes  you should not accept
or offer presses on.
     
     PC-GOLF can help you and your foursome to lower scores.
     
     PC-GOLF's menu gives you six choices.
           1. Introduction.
           2. Tally the scores for a round.
           3. Get the golfer's score sheet.
           4. Get the golf course list.
           5. Get the golfer's roster.
           6. Quit. Going to the 19th hole.
      1.Introduction.  You are using the introduction now.  This
        tells you what each part of the menu does.  The methods
        used for prompting and giving directions to PC-GOLF
        are explained.

      2.Tally the scores for a round.  This is where you record
        the golfers putts and scores for a round.  You also tell
        PC-GOLF whether a round is for handicapping, performance
        or just for practice.  You see the gross and the adjusted
        gross scores here too.

     3. Get the golfer's score sheet.  This is where you see each
        golfers performance in nine tables and charts.  You see
        putt  and  stroke averages  for each hole.   The double
        diamond flag marks the holes where you should not press
        your opponents.  See your Personal Best scores here.

     4. Get the golf course list.  This is where you add, change
        and delete courses and provide the information about par,
        course rating and hole handicaps.  You also review the
        golf course information here.  The course list holds nine
        golf courses.
 
     5. Get the golfer's roster. This is where you add, change
        and delete players, assign the players home course and
        initial handicap.  You also review the golfer's roster here.
        The roster holds sixteen golfers.

     6. Quit.  Going to the 19th hole.  This provides a smooth
        exit from PC-GOLF and a return to IBM DOS.
     
     
     Remember,  first things fourth.  That is where you start to
use PC-GOLF.  You add golf course information first.  The second
thing to do is add golfer information.  Once the course and player
information has been added you are ready to tally scores. When you
have tallied scores for a golfer, then you can see that players
performance in the score sheets.  This view of player performance
has not been available before.  It provides visibility and allows
the golfer to concentrate on the "main event" to raise his or her
level of achievement.
     
     PC-GOLF  welcomes men and women  golfers to a clear view of
their  performance.  The professional golf instructor can also use
the convenience and clarity of  PC-GOLF  to the students benefit.

     Answering prompts and giving directions to  PC-GOLF is easy.
You do it in two ways.  For one example. Just below the six item
menu you  will see the message:

          "You're away!"
          "PRESS the number of your choice. (1,2,3,4,5 or 6)".

You do just what the prompt requests.  You touch, type or strike 
the key  which is the  "number of your choice".  As soon as you
strike the key,  PC-GOLF  will act according to  your choice.

For the other example.  You will see a kind of message which
asks for information.

          "ENTER  the player's phone number,e.g. 555-1212 ".

Again, you do just what the prompt requests. In this case, you
type in the players telephone number, 123-4567, and then touch,
type or strike the ENTER key.  As soon as you strike the ENTER
key, PC-GOLF  will act  on the information you have ENTERed. 

     To answer prompts and give directions to PC-GOLF you simply
PRESS a key or ENTER information.  What about typo's?
     Whenever you PRESS a key or ENTER information and then say
"OOPS", you will find a friend in PC-GOLF.  The program is very
forgiving.  It allows you to make corrections to any input.  So,
don't worry about typing mistakes.  You can make corrections.

     Another friendly aspect of PC-GOLF lies in its anticipation
of a  potentially messy  mistake.  One such  mistake would be to
erase the scores  that a player has in the  data bank before you
were  really ready to do so.  To prevent the  messy mistake from
happening, PC-GOLF  asks you if you really  want to do what you
said  you  wanted to do.  In other words,  you have a chance to 
change your mind when the potential exists for a messy mistake.

     3. Get the golfer's score sheet.  This is where you see each
        golfers performance in nine tables and charts.  You see
        putt  and  stroke averages  for each hole.   The double
        diamond flag marks the holes where you should not press
        your opponents.  See your Personal Best scores here.

     This choice in the menu provides something unique and special
to the golfer.  Here you can see the hole-by-hole performance of
each player in the golfers roster.  There are nine displays for
showing the players putting performance and an additional nine
displays for showing the players scoring performance.  Each of the
nine  displays  can be  printed by  holding one of the Shift keys
down and then pressing the PrtSc key. Five of the displays are
tables, three are bar charts and one is a graph.

     PC-GOLF keeps your gross scores and putts for each hole on
your home course. You can keep several hundred rounds of scores and
putts for each hole on your course.  Each time you enter scores or
putts into the data bank, the new values are tested against the
previous lows.  The lowest of these two scores, for each hole, is
saved in the data bank.  This lets you  see your personal best
scores and putts for each hole.  PC-GOLF also keeps track of your
last twenty gross scores and your last twenty putting scores.
From this you can see your average gross score and putting score
for, up to twenty rounds.  PC-GOLF also keeps track of your 
all-time-low gross score and putting score.

     Your scores are shown as gross scores, as averages and as the
popular plus/minus average.  For example; rounds of ninety, eighty
four and eighty eight would be seen as 90, 84, 88 in the gross
score form.  These scores would be seen as the sum of the three
scores divided by three, or 87.3, in the average score format.

     Scores for individual holes can be shown in plus/minus form,
where a bogie is a plus one and a birdie is a minus one. Extending
this, a double bogie is plus two and an eagle is minus two.  The
major advantage of this form is that all scores displayed this way
are shown relative to par.  After all, that's what golf is all
about.  Trying to make par, or better, on as many of the holes as
you can.  The plus/minus displays show you how you are doing with
respect to par.  In the case of putts, where par is always two,
a three putt is plus one and a one putt is minus one.  The
plus/minus displays show your putts and scores relative to par.
This is a clear view of hole-by-hole performance.  It provides real
visibility so you can easily pinpoint the most likely holes for
improving your game.
     Now, a few words about the nine displays.  The displays show
either your gross scores or putts.  You make this choice from the
score sheet menu.

     Hole Handicap sequence table.  With this display, you can see
your scores in sequence according to the level of difficulty of
each hole. Average scores and plus/minus average scores are shown.
You can see right away how you do on the most difficult and least
difficult holes.

      Plus/Minus sequence table.  With this display, you can see
the players scores in sequence according to plus/minus averages.
Average scores and plus/minus average scores are shown. You can
see right away which holes you score the lowest on and the holes
where your scores are the highest.

     Average Scores.  With this display you can see your average
score for for every hole on your home course.  You can compare
the average score on every hole to par for that hole.  A special
grouping of average scores is shown for the par three, par four
and par five holes.  You can tell at a glance whether you score
best on the par three, par four or par five holes.

     Potpourri. This displays a collection of scores. The gross
scores for up to the last twenty rounds and the average of those
scores.  Your lowest score of all your rounds to date is also
displayed.  You get an overall picture of your past performance
from this display.


     Personal Best. With this display you can see the lowest
scores you have made on each hole on your home course.  You see
the number of rounds used to reach these scores and your low
score total is displayed. As of the date of the display, this
is your personal best score for each hole.  If you put it all
together, for eighteen holes, this is your finest round.


     Bar Charts.  There are three bar charts showing your scores
and putts in the plus/minus average form.  The vertical range of the
charts is from -1 to +4.  This covers average scores from birdie to
quadruple bogey. The horizontal range of the charts is from 1 to 18.
This covers each hole on your course.  For putts, the vertical range
covers everything from a one putt to a four putt.


     Average Scores Bar Chart.  With this display you can see your
average score for each hole on your home course in the plus/minus
form.  The double-diamond flag shows any holes that you should 
not start presses on.  If a hole has been flagged use discretion
in pressing an opponent.

     Hole Handicap Bar Chart.  With this display you can see the
effect that difficulty level has on your scores.  You can readily
see how you score on the most difficult and the least difficult
holes on your course.

     Low-to High Score Bar Chart.  With this display you see your
scores in low score to high score sequence.  You can easily see
the holes where you make the lowest scores and the holes where you
make the highest scores.  The holes that are the best candidates
for improvement of your game are apparent in this display.

     The Trend Chart.  This shows a graph of the players last 20
gross scores or putts.  However, it can be used as soon as you
tally at least one round.  The vertical range of the chart is 20
strokes.  If any score is 20 or more strokes higher than the lowest
score, then that  score is shown as the low score plus 19.

     5. Get the golfer's roster.  This is where you add, change and
        delete players, assign a player's  home course and initial
        handicap and erase a players score sheet.  You also review
        the golfer's roster here.  The roster holds sixteen players.

     Adding golfers to the roster is the second  thing to be done in
getting ready to use PC-GOLF.   Use the ADD option for this.  After
you have added a player to the roster  you can check the information
for accuracy.  Use the REVIEW option to display the golfer's roster.
Use the CHANGE option to correct any errors or make changes.  Use the
DELETE option to  remove a player from the roster.

     You build the roster by  adding players names and phone numbers.
You must also identify  each player  as a man or woman golfer.  This 
is required because the upper limit of the USGA handicap is different
for men and women golfers.  You will also provide the players initial
handicaps.  You must identify the  home course and the tee from which
each  golfer usually plays.   There will  be  times when you want to
"wipe the scoring sheet clean" for a player.  Use the ERASE option for
this.  Erasing scores or putts does not affect the players handicap in
any way.

      6.  QUIT. Going to the 19th hole.  This provides a smooth
          exit from PC-GOLF by safeguarding the players data
          bank and returning to DOS.

     This session with PC-GOLF is over.  If you have tallied any
scores or made changes to the players roster or course list, this
is the time for making a backup copy of your PC-GOLF diskette.
If something should happen to your PC-GOLF diskette, you could
recover simply by using the backup copy to create a new PC-GOLF
diskette.

      2.Tally the scores for a round.  This is where you record
        the golfers putts and scores for a round.  You also tell
        PC-GOLF whether a round is for handicapping, performance
        or just for practice.  You see gross scores, the adjusted
        gross score, putts and strokes displayed here.

     To tally scores you need the players scorecard for the round.
Of course, the player must already be in the players roster and the
player must have been assigned a home course.

     Tallying putts and scores means adding the putts and gross scores
you have made on each hole at your home course to the players data
bank.  Keeping track of a player's putts and scores for a sizable
number of rounds is an important feature of PC-GOLF.  The players
data bank will hold a player's scores and putts for several hundred
rounds.  The number of rounds to be added or kept in the player's data
bank is up to you.  You are the best judge of when to erase scores and
putts from the data bank and make a fresh start.  PC-GOLF gives you
control over the contents of the player's data bank.  It is up to you
whether or not to include the gross scores from any round in the
player's data bank.  The player's data bank is used to prepare the
hole-by-hole performance  you see in the player's score sheets.

     After you ENTER the players gross scores, PC-GOLF computes
the adjusted gross scores according to USGA rules, as follows:

     HANDICAP       LIMITATION ON HOLE SCORE
Plus or scratch-Limit of one over par on any hole.
 1 through 18  -Limit of two over par on number of holes equal to
                handicap. Limit of one over par on balance of holes.
19 through 36  -Limit of three over par on as many holes as the
                handicap exceeds 18 strokes.  Limit of two over par
                on balance of holes.
37 through 40  -For women golfers only.  Limit of four over par on as
                many holes as the handicap exceeds 36 strokes.  Limit
                of three over par on balance of holes.

     USGA note: The adjusted gross score shall be returned for
handicap purposes every time a player completes an 18-hole round,
no matter where it is played.

     You can TALLY a player's gross scores for any course which is in
the golf course list, whether or not it is the players home course.
In the TALLY display you will see a comparison of the player's gross
score,  the adjusted gross score and par for each hole.

     The players handicap is calculated using USGA rules.  It is
determined by taking the average of the lowest 10 of the last 20
differentials, multiplying by 96 percent and rounding off to the
the nearest whole number.  If less than 20 scores have been tallied,
the rules are: For players with less than 5 scores there is no USGA
handicap.  However, to accommodate players during the first four
rounds, the lowest of the four differentials is used to determine
the players handicap.

     For 5 to 19 differentials the rules are: For 5, 6 or 7 rounds
use the lowest 1, 2 or 3 differentials respectively.  For 8 or 9
rounds use the lowest 4; for 10 or 11, use the lowest 5; for 12 or 13,
use the lowest 6; for 14 or 15, use the lowest 7; for 16 or 17, use
the lowest 8; and for 18 or 19 rounds use the lowest 9 differentials.
Any handicap which was determined from less than the last twenty
differentials is given a suffix of T, e.g. 12T.

      A handicap differential is the difference between a player's
adjusted gross score and the course rating of the course where the
score was made.  This definition highlights the importance of the
course rating in the handicapping system.


     PC-GOLF's handicap calculations produce results identical to
those of any golf club or association which computes and maintains
handicaps in accordance with the USGA Handicap System.  PC-GOLF does
not, however, purport to establish a handicap authorized, sponsored
or approved by the USGA.  There are times when, for perfectly legiti-
mate reasons, you do not want to include a round in the handicap
calculations.  PC-GOLF gives you that option.

     Putting  is  half  the  game.  You can ENTER a player's putting 
scores for any course which is in the golf course list, whether or not
it is the players home course.  In  the  TALLY display you will see a
comparison of the player's putts, gross scores, strokes  and par for
each hole.  Putting scores which are ENTERed for rounds at a player's
home course will be saved in the players data bank.  The players data
bank is used to prepare the home course hole-by-hole performance you
will see in the players score sheets.

     The limits for putts and scores are 1 through 4 and 1 through 9,
respectively.  A "zero putt", which results from a "chip in",should be
entered as a 2 putt.  This maintains the net effect of not degrading
or inflating a player's putting performance with respect to par.

     4. Get the golf course list.  This is where you add, change and
        delete golf courses that you will be playing.  You enter in-
        formation about par, course rating and hole handicaps.  You
        also review the golf course information here. The course list
        holds nine courses.

     Adding courses to the course list is the first thing to be done
to get ready to use PC-GOLF.  Use the ADD option for this. After you
have added a course to the list you must check the information for
accuracy.  Use the REVIEW option to display the golf course list. Use
the CHANGE option to correct any error. PC-GOLF's benefits depend
directly upon accurate pars, hole handicaps and course ratings.

     You will need a scorecard for each course you add to the course
list.  The scorecard contains the detailed course information for
men's and ladies tees, pars and handicaps.  You will also need the
course ratings for each course you add.  Official course ratings are
assigned for each set of tees on the course.  Some courses have as
many as four sets of tees; GOLD, BLUE, WHITE and RED.  Get the course
rating for each set of tees on the course you are adding to the list.
They are available from the pro-shop.

     Sample data is provided to help you get familiar with the way
PC-GOLF works.  For this practice round with the Golf Course List,

                        INTRODUCTION

     PC-GOLF will help you improve your golf game.  The program
is easy to use and understand.  It is a very friendly program.
PC-GOLF is written especially for the amateur golfer and for the
IBM Personal Computer.  Use it with confidence that it will help
raise your level of achievement and enjoyment on the course.

     Player performance is the primary subject of the program. It
keeps track of your scores and your putts for each hole on your
home  course.  It shows you  how you are doing  on each hole.
PC-GOLF helps you concentrate on the main event so you can see
where  improvement  is most desirable and  most likely to be
achieved.  It will even mark the holes you should not accept or
offer presses on. PC-GOLF can help you improve your game.

     The main menu is the first thing you see when you use
PC-GOLF.  See, below, that PC-GOLF's menu gives you six
choices.  To help explain the menu and how to tell PC-GOLF what
you want to do, we will use arrows and brackets throughout the
users guide.

     The left pointing arrows <----- are used to give you
explanations and instructions.  Also, notice the choices you are
instructed to make are enclosed in brackets [].

     This is how it works.  PC-GOLF shows you a menu with
several items and asks you to make a choice.  When you make your
choice, PC-GOLF responds accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------
PC-GOLF    THE GOLFER'S PROGRAM     PC-GOLF <-----top line

PRESS the number of your choice. (1,2,3,4,5 or 6). [1]<---press
----------------------------------------------------------------

     This is how the menu system works. PC-GOLF shows you the main
menu and asks you to make a choice. When you make your choice the
program responds accordingly.  Pressing the number one key, for
example, will lead you to the part entitled "Introduction".  This
part of PC-GOLF tells you what each part of the menu does. The
Introduction is a brief, "on-line" user's guide and is helpful in
reviewing what each part of the menu does.  We will not use the
on-line user's guide in these lessons.  Instead, continue to read
the printed Introduction - Lesson 1.  You see that pressing the
number of your choice leads you to the desired part of PC-GOLF.

     You're itching to press the number one key are'nt you?
.EJECT
     O.K. Brackets surround the number one key and the message
says to do it so go ahead.  Got some action there alright.  Now
you can answer with [N]<-----PRESS. You can alternately PRESS the
number 1 key and the letter N if you wish.  You can also make any
other choice in the menu and answer with the letter N. This shows
you are in control through the menu system.  Let's continue.

     Each of the six items in the main menu serves a special
purpose.  The six parts of PC-GOLF work together to give you
a new  insight into your game .  A brief explanation of each
of the options follows.

     1. Introduction.  This tells you what each part of the menu
does. The methods used for prompting and giving directions to
PC-GOLF are explained.  Samples are included in the data bank to
help you get familiar with the way the program works.

     2. Tally the scores for a round.  This is where you record
the golfers putts and scores for a round.  You also tell PC-GOLF
whether a round is for handicapping, performance or just for
practice.  You see the gross and the adjusted gross scores here
too.

     3. Get the golfer's score sheet.  This is where you see each
golfers performance in tables and bar charts.  You see putt  and
stroke averages  for each hole.   The double diamond flag marks
the holes where you should not press your opponents.  See your
Personal Best scores here.

     4. Get the golf course list.  This is where you add, change
and delete courses and provide the information about par, course
rating and hole handicaps.  You also review the golf course
information here.  The course list holds nine golf courses.

     5. Get the golfer's roster. This is where you add, change
and delete players, assign the players home course and initial
handicap.  You also review the golfer's roster here. The roster
holds sixteen golfers.

     6. Quit.  Going to the 19th hole.  This saves your data,
provides a smooth exit from PC-GOLF and a return to DOS.

     Remember,  first-things-fourth.  That is where you start to
use PC-GOLF.  You add golf course information first.  The second
thing to do is add golfer information. Once the course and player
information has been added you're ready to tally scores. When you
have tallied scores for a golfer, then you can see the players
performance in the score sheets.  This view of player performance
has not been available before.  It provides visibility and allows
the golfer to concentrate on the "main event" to raise his or her
level of achievement.

     PC-GOLF  welcomes men and women  golfers to a clear view of
their performance.  The professional golf instructor can also use
the convenience and clarity of PC-GOLF to the students benefit.
.EJECT
     Answering prompts and giving directions to PC-GOLF is easy.
You do it in two ways.  For one example. Just below the six item
menu you  will see the message:

          "You're away!"
          "PRESS the number of your choice. (1,2,3,4,5 or 6)".

     You do just what the prompt requests.  You touch, type or
strike the key which is the "number of your choice". As soon as
you strike the key, PC-GOLF will act accordingly.

     For the other example.  You will see a kind of message which
asks for information.  One such message is listed below.

          "ENTER  the player's phone number,e.g. 555-1212 ".

     Again, you do just what the prompt requests. In this case,
you type in the players telephone number, 123-4567, and then
touch, type or strike the ENTER key.  As soon as you strike the
ENTER key, PC-GOLF will act on the information you have ENTERed.

     To answer prompts and give directions to PC-GOLF you simply
PRESS a key or ENTER information.  What about typo's?

     Whenever you PRESS a key or ENTER information and then say
"OOPS", you will find a friend in PC-GOLF.  The program is very
forgiving.  It allows you to make corrections to any input. So,
don't worry about typing mistakes.  You can make corrections.

     Another friendly aspect of PC-GOLF lies in its anticipation
of a  potentially messy  mistake.  One such  mistake would be to
erase the scores  that a player has in the  data bank before you
were  really ready to do so.  To prevent the  messy mistake from
happening, PC-GOLF  asks you if you really  want to do what you
said you wanted to do, before actually doing it.  In other words,
you have a chance to change your mind when the potential exists
for a messy mistake.

     Pauses are used to give you all the time you need to decide
your next step or to view a display of your scores or putts.  The
usual message associated with a pause is:

              "PRESS the space bar to continue."

     The pause may or may not be accompanied by an audible BEEP.
In either case, just press the space bar to proceed.

     Sample data is provided to help you get familiar with the way
PC-GOLF works. Three fictitious golf courses and four fictitious
players are included in the data bank. The player named Sam Smith
has gross scores in the data bank, but no putting scores.  Bill
Baker has both gross scores and putting scores in the data bank.
Dan Duffer and Jane Jones have no scores at all. You can use these
fictitious players and courses to find out how to make changes,
how to tally scores and how to display the players score sheets.

Practicing helps. So use the fictitious samples to get familiar
with how the program works.

          PC-GOLF     THE GOLFER'S PROGRAM    PC-GOLF
          Version 1.5 (C) Copyright 1984  Ed Chandler

                         USER'S GUIDE

     PC-GOLF's User's Guide helps you learn how to use PC-GOLF.
The Guide helps you learn all about the program in a short time.
There are six lessons altogether. Each lesson explains one part
of the program. As you complete a lesson you are ready to use that
part of PC-GOLF. The six lessons cover the six menu options.

     The very first thing you must do is  make a PC-GOLF RUN
DISKETTE to use while you take the lessons. Here's how to do it.

1. Insert your DOS Diskette which also contains BASIC in the
   A Drive. BOOT UP DOS. Make responses to Date and Time prompts.

2. Insert a new or unused diskette in DRIVE B.
   This diskette will become the PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE.

   In the following steps you are to type in the information
   enclosed by brackets [].
   <enter> means you are to press the ENTER key.
   <------ used for explanations.
   SS means Single Sided disk drives.
   DS means Double Sided disk drives.
   F6 means the Function Key labeled F6.

3. Now to format the RUN DISKETTE with the System files option.

   A>[FORMAT B:/S]<enter>  <---format the disk in drive B:
   insert new diskette for drive B:
   and strike any key when ready   <---do what it says

   Formatting...Format complete
   System transferred

   322560 bytes total disk space   <---160256 for SS drives
    14336 bytes used by system     <----13824 for SS drives
   308224 bytes available on disk  <---146432 for SS drives

   Format another (Y/N)?[N] <---the answer is no.

4. To put a copy of BASICA on the PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE.

   A>[COPY A:BASICA.COM B:]<enter> <---copy BASICA onto the
   BASICA     COM                      PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE
          1 File(s) copied  <---if the files message says 1
                                File(s) copied, you must skip
                                STEP 4a and do STEP 5 next.
                            <---if the files message says 0
                                File(s) copied do STEP 4a.
.EJECT
4a To put a copy of BASIC on the PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE.

   A>[COPY A:BASIC.COM B:]<enter>  <---copy BASIC onto the
   BASIC      COM                      PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE
          1 File(s) copied  <---if the files message says 0
                                File(s) copied you must get a
                                DOS Disk with BASIC or BASICA
                                and start again at STEP 1.

5. Remove your DOS diskette from the A Drive.
   Insert your PC-GOLF MASTER DISKETTE in the A Drive.

6. Copy all files from the PC-GOLF MASTER DISKETTE to Drive B.

   A>[COPY A:A*.* B:]<enter> <---command to copy all of
   ACOURSE   ASC                 PC-GOLF's files to Drive B.
   AINTRO    ASC
   APERFORM  ASC
   APLAYER   ASC
   ......   ...     <-----all the rest, one after the other.
         21 File(s) copied <---all of PC-GOLF'S files copied

   REMOVE your PC-GOLF MASTER DISKETTE from the A Drive
   and store it in a safe place, away from magnetic fields.
   REMOVE your PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE from the B Drive.
   INSERT your PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE into the A Drive.

7. Check the autoexec file for a match with BASICA.
   The  AUTOEXEC.BAT  file uses BASICA.

   If STEP 4 did show BASICA then you must skip to STEP 9.

   If STEP 4 did not show BASICA and STEP 4a did show BASIC
   then you must do STEP 8.

8. Make the autoexec file use BASIC instead of BASICA.

   A>[COPY CON: A:AUTOEXEC.BAT]<enter> <---create autoexec file
   [DATE]<enter>
   [TIME]<enter>
   [BASIC A:AMAIN.ZRO/S:512/F:5]<enter> <---use BASIC
   Press the F6 KEY(not the letter F and number 6)<enter>
   ^Z <---this is what you get when you press the F6 KEY.
         1 File(s) copied <---autoexec file completed

9. That's it! You have made the PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE.

   Next you should make a BACKUP for the RUN DISKETTE.
   Since the PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE has System files on it
   DISKCOPY must be used to make the BACKUP.
.EJECT
10.To make a BACKUP for the PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE.
   Remove your PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE from the A Drive.
   Insert your DOS Diskette in the A Drive.
   Insert a new or unused diskette in the B Drive.
   This diskette will become the BACKUP RUN DISKETTE.

   A>[FORMAT B:]<enter>  <---format the disk in drive B:
   insert new diskette for drive B:
   and strike any key when ready   <---do what it says

   Formatting...Format complete

   322560 bytes total disk space   <---160256 for SS drives
   322560 bytes available on disk  <---160256 for SS drives

   Format another (Y/N)?[N] <---the answer is no.

   A>[DISKCOPY A: B:]<enter> <---copy A to B

   Insert source diskette in drive A  <---PC-GOLF RUN
   Insert target diskette in drive B  <---BACKUP RUN
   Strike any key when ready        <---do what it says
   copying 2 side(s)
   Copy complete 

   Copy another? (Y/N)[N] <---the answer is no.
   A>            <---remove BACKUP RUN diskette from Drive B

   That's it! You now have a PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE and a
   BACKUP PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE. Just what every golfer
   needs to keep score with PC-GOLF.

Now Boot Up your PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE. Answer the prompts.

After a delay, the PC-GOLF MENU will appear on the display.

                    GOLFER'S SCORE SHEET


     3. Get the golfer's score sheet.  This is where you see each
golfers performance in tables and bar charts. You see putt and stroke
averages for each hole. The double diamond flag marks the holes where
you should not press your opponents. You can see your Personal Best
scores here.

     This option in PC-GOLF'S main menu provides something unique and
special for the golfer.  This option is used to show the hole-by-hole
performance for each player in the golfers roster.  There are nine
displays for showing the players putting performance and another nine
displays for the players scoring performance. Five of the nine can
be printed using the PrtSc function of the IBM PC. The four remaining
displays are graphs. This option shows how the golfer is doing on
each and every hole at his home course. The golfer's "Personal Best"
rounds in scoring and putting are displayed here. The primary purpose
of this option is to show the golfer how he is doing plus the holes
where improvement is most likely and most desirable.  It provides
visibility into the golfer's game through putts and total strokes.

     Sample data is provided to help you to get familiar with the
way PC-GOLF works. For this practice round with the Golfer's Roster,
just follow the arrows <----- and key in the information that is
enclosed in brackets []<-----.  Let's start at PC-GOLF'S main menu.

                         GOLFER'S ROSTER


     5. Get the golfer's roster.  This is where you add, change and
        delete players, assign a player's  home course and initial
        handicap and erase a players score sheet.  You also review
        the golfer's roster here.  The roster holds sixteen players.

     Adding golfers to the roster is the second  thing to be done in
getting ready to use PC-GOLF.   Use the ADD option for this.  After
you have added a player to the roster  you can check the information
for accuracy.  Use the REVIEW option to display the golfer's roster.
Use the CHANGE option to correct any errors or make changes.  Use the
DELETE option to  remove a player from the roster.

     You build the roster by  adding players names and phone numbers.
You must also identify  each player  as a man or woman golfer.  This
is required because the upper limit of the USGA handicap is different
for men and women golfers.  You will also provide the players initial
handicaps.  You must identify the  home course and the tee from which
each  golfer usually plays.   There will  be  times when you want to
"wipe the scoring sheet clean" for a player. Use the ERASE option for
this. Erasing scores or putts does not affect the players handicap in
any way.

     Sample data is provided to help you to get familiar with the
way PC-GOLF works. For this practice round with the Golfer's Roster,
just follow the arrows <----- and key in the information that is

----------------------------------------------------------------
THE CONCEPT OF USER SUPPORTED SOFTWARE:
User-supported software is an experiment in economics and in the
distribution of computer programs, based on these beliefs:
1. That the value and utility of software is best assessed by the
user on his or her own computer system.
2. That the creation of personal computer software can and should
be supported by the computing community.
3. That copying of programs and documentation should be encouraged
rather than discouraged.
4. Easy distribution of the software and voluntary payment for its
use  eliminates  advertising costs  and copy  protection schemes.
5. Users obtain quality software at reasonable costs.  Users can
try it out before buying, and do so at their own pace in their own
home or office.
6. The best programs will survive, based on software quality,
continued updates by the authors and usefulness to the users.

If you too believe in these ideals, your contribution is solicited
to help make it work.  Please join the experiment.
------------------------------------------------------------------
OBTAINING USER SUPPORTED SOFTWARE. Anyone may request a copy of a
user-supported program from the program's Author. Supporters must
send blank, formatted 5 1/4 inch diskettes(marked as single-sided
or double-sided) and a self addressed, postage-paid return mailer

                Copyright 1984 Ed Chandler

           UPDATES from/for the USERS of PC-GOLF.

1. From Richard Pearson in Wyoming, Minnesota.
   The AUTOEXEC.BAT file must be modified if you want to run
   PC-GOLF on the TANDY 1000. Here is what Richard did to
   make it run on his Tandy. He changed the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
              from: BASIC A:AMAIN.ZRO/S:512/F:5
              to  : BASIC A:AMAIN.ZRO/I/S:512/F:5
   This is a requirement of MS DOS/GW BASIC.  The /I switch
   prevents dynamic allocation of space during file operations.
   Many thanks to Richard Pearson.

2. From Gordon Kaverly in Lennon, Michigan.
   Gordon has a Kaypro with a hard disk. He wanted to run from the
   hard disk rather than the floppy on drive A. We worked it out
   over the telephone. After the telecon, it seemed to me this
   should be a standard capability.  The constraint that PC-GOLF
   was to be run on the A drive has been removed. You can now
   load PC-GOLF into any drive you wish. Then when you make the
   drive containing PC-GOLF the default drive, it will execute
   properly. The original AUTOEXEC.BAT file and a new BATCH file
   named PCGOLF.BAT are on the PC-GOLF diskette. You can take
   your choice. They look like this:
          AUTOEXEC.BAT-->  DATE
                           TIME
                           BASICA A:AMAIN.ZRO/S:512/F:5
           PCGOLF.BAT -->  DATE
                           TIME
                           A:BASICA AMAIN.ZRO/S:512/F:5
   If your BASIC is not on drive A, you will have to change the
   drive letter in the PC-GOLF.BAT file.
   Many thanks to Gordon Kaverly.

3. What to do when you SWITCH to a later VERSION of PC-GOLF !
   For example, when you switch from version 1.4 to 1.5, you
   undoubtedly want to continue using the same PC-GOLF data
   base you were using with the 1.4 version. Well, it's easy
   to do that.  Here's how.
      a. Place the PC-GOLF version 1.4 diskette in the A drive.
      b. Place the PC-GOLF version 1.5 diskette in the B drive.
      c. Select the A drive as the default drive.
      d. When the A> prompt appears, ENTER the following copy
         command.
      d. A>COPY A:*.DAT B:
   The six files which make up your version 1.4 data base will
   replace the equivalent files in the version 1.5 data base.
   Now you can run the latest version of PC-GOLF programs and
   continue to build your personal data base.
.EJECT
4. User's have asked about increasing the number of golfers
   beyond the 16 presently allowed. PC-GOLF was written for the
   benefit of the individual golfer, a kind of one-on-one thing
   for the active amateur golfer and his golfing buddies. There
   seems to be a place for another kind of PC-GOLF too, alongside
   the 1.x version. There has been some tentative design work
   done but nothing definite. If things all come together in the
   first half of '86 there could be a version 2.x ready for use
   in 1986.

5. Who has the next input for the "UPDATE" file ?

                         TALLY SCORES


      2.Tally the scores for a round.  This is where you record
        the golfers putts and scores for a round.  You also tell
        PC-GOLF whether a round is for handicapping, performance
        or just for practice.  You see gross scores, the adjusted
        gross score, putts and strokes displayed here.

     To tally scores you need the players scorecard for the round.
Of course, the player must already be in the players roster and the
player must have been assigned a home course.

     Tallying putts and scores means  adding  putts and gross scores
you have made on each hole at your home course to the players data
bank.  Keeping track of a player's putts and scores for a sizable
number of rounds is an important feature of PC-GOLF.  The players
data bank will hold a player's scores and putts for several hundred
rounds. The number of rounds to be added or kept in the player's data
bank is up to you. You are the best judge of when to erase scores and
putts from the data bank and make a fresh start.  PC-GOLF gives you
control over the contents of the player's data bank.  It is up to you
whether or not to include the gross scores from any round in the
player's data bank.  The player's data bank is used to prepare the
hole-by-hole performance  you see in the player's score sheets.

     After you ENTER the players gross scores, PC-GOLF computes the
adjusted gross scores under the USGA equitable stroke control rule.

     HANDICAP       LIMITATION ON HOLE SCORE
Plus or scratch-Limit of one over par on any hole.
 1 through 18  -Limit of two over par on number of holes equal to
                handicap. Limit of one over par on balance of holes.
19 through 36  -Limit or three over par on as many holes as the
                handicap exceeds 18 strokes.  Limit of two over par
                on balance of holes.
37 through 40  -For women golfers only.  Limit of four over par on as
                many holes as the handicap exceeds 36 strokes.  Limit
                of three over par on balance of holes.

     USGA note: The adjusted gross score shall be returned for
handicap purposes every time a player completes an 18-hole round,
no matter where it is played.

     You can ENTER a player's gross scores for any course which is in
the golf course list, whether or not it is the players home course.
In the TALLY display you will see a comparison of the player's gross
score,  the adjusted gross score and par for each hole.

     The players handicap is calculated using USGA rules.  It is
determined by taking the average of the lowest 10 of the last 20
differentials, multiplying by 96 percent and rounding off to the
the nearest whole number.  If less than 20 scores have been tallied,
the rules are: For players with less than 5 scores there is no USGA
handicap.  However, to accommodate players during the first four
rounds, the lowest of the four differentials is used to determine
the players handicap.

     For 5 to 19 differentials the rules are: For 5, 6 or 7 rounds
use the lowest 1, 2 or 3 differentials respectively.  For 8 or 9
rounds use the lowest 4; for 10 or 11, use the lowest 5; for 12 or 13,
use the lowest 6; for 14 or 15, use the lowest 7; for 16 or 17, use
the lowest 8; and for 18 or 19 rounds use the lowest 9 differentials.
Any handicap which was determined from less than the last twenty
differentials is given a suffix of T, e.g. 12T.

      A handicap differential is the difference between a player's
adjusted gross score and the course rating of the course where the
score was made.  This definition highlights the importance of the
course rating in the handicapping system.

     PC-GOLF's handicap calculations produce results identical to
those of any golf club or association which computes and maintains
handicaps in accordance with the USGA Handicap System.  PC-GOLF does
not, however, purport to establish a handicap authorized, sponsored
or approved by the USGA.  There are times when, for perfectly legiti-
mate reasons, you do not want to include a round in the handicap
calculations.  PC-GOLF gives you that option.

     Putting  is  half  the  game.  You can ENTER a player's putting
scores for any course which is in the golf course list, whether or not
it is the players home course.  In  the  TALLY display you will see a
comparison of the player's putts, gross scores, strokes  and par for
each hole.  Putting scores which are ENTERed for rounds at a player's
home course will be saved in the players data bank.  The players data
bank is used to prepare the home course hole-by-hole performance you
will see in the players score sheets.

     The limits for putts and scores are 1 through 4 and 1 through 9,
respectively.  A "zero putt", which results from a "chip in",should be
entered as a 2 putt.  This maintains the net effect of not degrading
or inflating a player's putting performance with respect to par.

     Sample data is provided to help you get familiar with the way
PC-GOLF works.  For this practice round with the Score Keeper
just follow the arrows <----- and key in the information that is
enclosed in brackets []<-----. Let's start at PC-GOLF's main menu.
If necessary, Boot Up your PC-GOLF RUN DISKETTE to get started.
After answering the DATE and TIME prompts, there will be a delay
before the Main Menu appears on the display.
