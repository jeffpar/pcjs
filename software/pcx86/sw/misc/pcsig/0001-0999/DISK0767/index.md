## Information about "THE BIBLE 2-7 (766,768,769,770,771,772)"

    This disk is part of a seven-disk set with the entire King James version
    of the Bible.  It is in text file format, making it easy to locate
    verses, add passages into documents, or prepare manuscript studies.
    
    Since it is all ASCII text files, each book is a separate file.  When
    you get the disks, the files are archived, or ``squeezed'', so you must
    first unsqueeze them onto either 19 other 360K floppies or onto your
    hard drive.  Be advised that some books of the Bible are too long to fit
    into some wordprocessors that limit the size of documents to the amount
    of available RAM.
    
    To view or search these files, you need to use a wordprocessor or some
    kind of viewing shell.  No such program is provided on this disk.

DEU 1:1  These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side
 Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between
 Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

DEU 1:2  (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir
 unto Kadeshbarnea.)

DEU 1:3  And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on
 the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
 according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;

DEU 1:4  After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in
 Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:

DEU 1:5  On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this
 law, saying,

DEU 1:6  The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long
 enough in this mount:

DEU 1:7  Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the
 Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills,
 and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the
 Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.

DEU 1:8  Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land
 which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give
 unto them and to their seed after them.

DEU 1:9  And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you
 myself alone:

DEU 1:10  The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day
 as the stars of heaven for multitude.

DEU 1:11  (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more
 as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)

DEU 1:12  How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your
 strife?

DEU 1:13  Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
 tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

DEU 1:14  And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is
 good for us to do.

DEU 1:15  So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made
 them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and
 captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your
 tribes.

DEU 1:16  And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes
 between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his
 brother, and the stranger that is with him.

DEU 1:17  Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small
 as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the
 judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto
 me, and I will hear it.

DEU 1:18  And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.

DEU 1:19  And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and
 terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites,
 as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.

DEU 1:20  And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites,
 which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

DEU 1:21  Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and
 possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not,
 neither be discouraged.

DEU 1:22  And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men
 before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by
 what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.

DEU 1:23  And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of
 a tribe:

DEU 1:24  And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the
 valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

DEU 1:25  And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it
 down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which
 the LORD our God doth give us.

DEU 1:26  Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
 commandment of the LORD your God:

DEU 1:27  And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us,
 he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the
 hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

DEU 1:28  Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,
 saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and
 walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.

DEU 1:29  Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

DEU 1:30  The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,
 according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;

DEU 1:31  And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God
 bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye
 came into this place.

DEU 1:32  Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,

DEU 1:33  Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch
 your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in
 a cloud by day.

DEU 1:34  And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware,
 saying,

DEU 1:35  Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see
 that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers.

DEU 1:36  Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I
 give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath
 wholly followed the LORD.

DEU 1:37  Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also
 shalt not go in thither.

DEU 1:38  But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in
 thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.

DEU 1:39  Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your
 children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they
 shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.

DEU 1:40  But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness
 by the way of the Red sea.

DEU 1:41  Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD,
 we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us.
 And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go
 up into the hill.

DEU 1:42  And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight;
 for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.

DEU 1:43  So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the
 commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.

DEU 1:44  And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against
 you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.

DEU 1:45  And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not
 hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

DEU 1:46  So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye
 abode there.

DEU 2:1  Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way
 of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many
 days.

DEU 2:2  And the LORD spake unto me, saying,

DEU 2:3  Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.

DEU 2:4  And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast
 of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be
 afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:

DEU 2:5  Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not
 so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a
 possession.

DEU 2:6  Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall
 also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.

DEU 2:7  For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand:
 he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the
 LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.

DEU 2:8  And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which
 dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber,
 we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.

DEU 2:9  And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend
 with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession;
 because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.

DEU 2:10  The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and
 tall, as the Anakims;

DEU 2:11  Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites
 called them Emims.

DEU 2:12  The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau
 succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt
 in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD
 gave unto them.

DEU 2:13  Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went
 over the brook Zered.

DEU 2:14  And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come
 over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation
 of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto
 them.

DEU 2:15  For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them
 from among the host, until they were consumed.

DEU 2:16  So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead
 from among the people,

DEU 2:17  That the LORD spake unto me, saying,

DEU 2:18  Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

DEU 2:19  And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
 distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land
 of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the
 children of Lot for a possession.

DEU 2:20  (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in
 old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

DEU 2:21  A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD
 destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their
 stead:

DEU 2:22  As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he
 destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt
 in their stead even unto this day:

DEU 2:23  And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
 Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt
 in their stead.)

DEU 2:24  Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold,
 I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his
 land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.

DEU 2:25  This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee
 upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report
 of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.

DEU 2:26  And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon
 king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

DEU 2:27  Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will
 neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

DEU 2:28  Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water
 for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;

DEU 2:29  (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which
 dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which
 the LORD our God giveth us.

DEU 2:30  But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD
 thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might
 deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.

DEU 2:31  And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his
 land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.

DEU 2:32  Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at
 Jahaz.

DEU 2:33  And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and
 his sons, and all his people.

DEU 2:34  And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the
 men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to
 remain:

DEU 2:35  Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil
 of the cities which we took.

DEU 2:36  From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the
 city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too
 strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:

DEU 2:37  Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto
 any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto
 whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

DEU 3:1  Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of
 Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

DEU 3:2  And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and
 all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as
 thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

DEU 3:3  So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of
 Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him
 remaining.

DEU 3:4  And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we
 took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom
 of Og in Bashan.

DEU 3:5  All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside
 unwalled towns a great many.

DEU 3:6  And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon,
 utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.

DEU 3:7  But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to
 ourselves.

DEU 3:8  And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the
 Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto
 mount Hermon;

DEU 3:9  (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it
 Shenir;)

DEU 3:10  All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto
 Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

DEU 3:11  For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold
 his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of
 Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it,
 after the cubit of a man.

DEU 3:12  And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is
 by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I
 unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

DEU 3:13  And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave
 I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan,
 which was called the land of giants.

DEU 3:14  Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the
 coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,
 Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

DEU 3:15  And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

DEU 3:16  And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even
 unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river
 Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;

DEU 3:17  The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth
 even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah
 eastward.

DEU 3:18  And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath
 given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your
 brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.

DEU 3:19  But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know
 that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;

DEU 3:20  Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto
 you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given
 them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession,
 which I have given you.

DEU 3:21  And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all
 that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do
 unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.

DEU 3:22  Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.

DEU 3:23  And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,

DEU 3:24  O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and
 thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do
 according to thy works, and according to thy might?

DEU 3:25  I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond
 Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

DEU 3:26  But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me:
 and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this
 matter.

DEU 3:27  Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
 westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with
 thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

DEU 3:28  But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he
 shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land
 which thou shalt see.

DEU 3:29  So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.

DEU 4:1  Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the
 judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and
 possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.

DEU 4:2  Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye
 diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your
 God which I command you.

DEU 4:3  Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the
 men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among
 you.

DEU 4:4  But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of
 you this day.

DEU 4:5  Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my
 God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess
 it.

DEU 4:6  Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
 understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these
 statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding
 people.

DEU 4:7  For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as
 the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?

DEU 4:8  And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so
 righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?

DEU 4:9  Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou
 forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy
 heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;

DEU 4:10  Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in
 Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will
 make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that
 they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.

DEU 4:11  And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
 burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick
 darkness.

DEU 4:12  And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard
 the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.

DEU 4:13  And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to
 perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.

DEU 4:14  And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
 judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess
 it.

DEU 4:15  Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of
 similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst
 of the fire:

DEU 4:16  Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the
 similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

DEU 4:17  The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any
 winged fowl that flieth in the air,

DEU 4:18  The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness
 of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:

DEU 4:19  And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the
 sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be
 driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided
 unto all nations under the whole heaven.

DEU 4:20  But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron
 furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are
 this day.

DEU 4:21  Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that
 I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land,
 which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:

DEU 4:22  But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall
 go over, and possess that good land.

DEU 4:23  Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD
 your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the
 likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.

DEU 4:24  For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

DEU 4:25  When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall
 have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a
 graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight
 of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:

DEU 4:26  I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye
 shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to
 possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be
 destroyed.

DEU 4:27  And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be
 left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.

DEU 4:28  And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and
 stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

DEU 4:29  But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find
 him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.

DEU 4:30  When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon
 thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be
 obedient unto his voice;

DEU 4:31  (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee,
 neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware
 unto them.

DEU 4:32  For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since
 the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of
 heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great
 thing is, or hath been heard like it?

DEU 4:33  Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst
 of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?

DEU 4:34  Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of
 another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by
 a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to
 all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

DEU 4:35  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is
 God; there is none else beside him.

DEU 4:36  Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct
 thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his
 words out of the midst of the fire.

DEU 4:37  And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after
 them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;

DEU 4:38  To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou
 art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is
 this day.

DEU 4:39  Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the
 LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none
 else.

DEU 4:40  Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I
 command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children
 after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the
 LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.

DEU 4:41  Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
 sunrising;

DEU 4:42  That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour
 unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these
 cities he might live:

DEU 4:43  Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the
 Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the
 Manassites.

DEU 4:44  And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:

DEU 4:45  These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which
 Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.

DEU 4:46  On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land
 of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the
 children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:

DEU 4:47  And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two
 kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;

DEU 4:48  From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount
 Sion, which is Hermon,

DEU 4:49  And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea
 of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

DEU 5:1  And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the
 statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn
 them, and keep, and do them.

DEU 5:2  The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

DEU 5:3  The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even
 us, who are all of us here alive this day.

DEU 5:4  The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst
 of the fire,

DEU 5:5  (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word
 of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into
 the mount;) saying,

DEU 5:6  I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt,
 from the house of bondage.

DEU 5:7  Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

DEU 5:8  Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
 thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is
 in the waters beneath the earth:

DEU 5:9  Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the
 LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
 children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,

DEU 5:10  And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my
 commandments.

DEU 5:11  Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the
 LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

DEU 5:12  Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath
 commanded thee.

DEU 5:13  Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

DEU 5:14  But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou
 shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy
 manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy
 cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and
 thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.

DEU 5:15  And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that
 the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a
 stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the
 sabbath day.

DEU 5:16  Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded
 thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee,
 in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

DEU 5:17  Thou shalt not kill.

DEU 5:18  Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

DEU 5:19  Neither shalt thou steal.

DEU 5:20  Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

DEU 5:21  Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou
 covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his
 maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.

DEU 5:22  These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out
 of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a
 great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of
 stone, and delivered them unto me.

DEU 5:23  And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the
 darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me,
 even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;

DEU 5:24  And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and
 his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we
 have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.

DEU 5:25  Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us:
 if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.

DEU 5:26  For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the
 living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?

DEU 5:27  Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak
 thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will
 hear it, and do it.

DEU 5:28  And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me;
 and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this
 people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they
 have spoken.

DEU 5:29  O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and
 keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with
 their children for ever!

DEU 5:30  Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.

DEU 5:31  But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee
 all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt
 teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess
 it.

DEU 5:32  Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded
 you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

DEU 5:33  Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded
 you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may
 prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.

DEU 6:1  Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which
 the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land
 whither ye go to possess it:

DEU 6:2  That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and
 his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son,
 all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.

DEU 6:3  Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well
 with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers
 hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.

DEU 6:4  Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

DEU 6:5  And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with
 all thy soul, and with all thy might.

DEU 6:6  And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine
 heart:

DEU 6:7  And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk
 of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the
 way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

DEU 6:8  And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be
 as frontlets between thine eyes.

DEU 6:9  And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy
 gates.

DEU 6:10  And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into
 the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
 to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,

DEU 6:11  And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and
 wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou
 plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;

DEU 6:12  Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out
 of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

DEU 6:13  Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by
 his name.

DEU 6:14  Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are
 round about you;

DEU 6:15  (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger
 of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the
 face of the earth.

DEU 6:16  Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.

DEU 6:17  Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and
 his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.

DEU 6:18  And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the
 LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess
 the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers.

DEU 6:19  To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath
 spoken.

DEU 6:20  And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the
 testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath
 commanded you?

DEU 6:21  Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt;
 and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:

DEU 6:22  And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt,
 upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:

DEU 6:23  And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give
 us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

DEU 6:24  And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD
 our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at
 this day.

DEU 6:25  And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these
 commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.

DEU 7:1  When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou
 goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the
 Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the
 Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and
 mightier than thou;

DEU 7:2  And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt
 smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them,
 nor shew mercy unto them:

DEU 7:3  Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt
 not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.

DEU 7:4  For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve
 other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy
 thee suddenly.

DEU 7:5  But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and
 break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven
 images with fire.

DEU 7:6  For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God
 hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that
 are upon the face of the earth.

DEU 7:7  The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye
 were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:

DEU 7:8  But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath
 which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a
 mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of
 Pharaoh king of Egypt.

DEU 7:9  Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God,
 which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his
 commandments to a thousand generations;

DEU 7:10  And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he
 will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.

DEU 7:11  Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the
 judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.

DEU 7:12  Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments,
 and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the
 covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:

DEU 7:13  And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will
 also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and
 thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy
 sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

DEU 7:14  Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or
 female barren among you, or among your cattle.

DEU 7:15  And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none
 of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay
 them upon all them that hate thee.

DEU 7:16  And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall
 deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou
 serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.

DEU 7:17  If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how
 can I dispossess them?

DEU 7:18  Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the
 LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

DEU 7:19  The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the
 wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy
 God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of
 whom thou art afraid.

DEU 7:20  Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they
 that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.

DEU 7:21  Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among
 you, a mighty God and terrible.

DEU 7:22  And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little
 and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the
 field increase upon thee.

DEU 7:23  But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy
 them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.

DEU 7:24  And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt
 destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand
 before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

DEU 7:25  The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt
 not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest
 thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.

DEU 7:26  Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou
 be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt
 utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

DEU 8:1  All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to
 do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the
 LORD sware unto your fathers.

DEU 8:2  And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee
 these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to
 know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or
 no.

DEU 8:3  And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with
 manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might
 make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that
 proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.

DEU 8:4  Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these
 forty years.

DEU 8:5  Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his
 son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.

DEU 8:6  Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to
 walk in his ways, and to fear him.

DEU 8:7  For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks
 of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;

DEU 8:8  A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
 pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

DEU 8:9  A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not
 lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills
 thou mayest dig brass.

DEU 8:10  When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy
 God for the good land which he hath given thee.

DEU 8:11  Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his
 commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this
 day:

DEU 8:12  Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses,
 and dwelt therein;

DEU 8:13  And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy
 gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;

DEU 8:14  Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God,
 which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;

DEU 8:15  Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were
 fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who
 brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;

DEU 8:16  Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew
 not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good
 at thy latter end;

DEU 8:17  And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath
 gotten me this wealth.

DEU 8:18  But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth
 thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware
 unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

DEU 8:19  And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk
 after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you
 this day that ye shall surely perish.

DEU 8:20  As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall
 ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your
 God.

DEU 9:1  Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to
 possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up
 to heaven,

DEU 9:2  A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou
 knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children
 of Anak!

DEU 9:3  Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth
 over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall
 bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy
 them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.

DEU 9:4  Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast
 them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought
 me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD
 doth drive them out from before thee.

DEU 9:5  Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost
 thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the
 LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform
 the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

DEU 9:6  Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good
 land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.

DEU 9:7  Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to
 wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land
 of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the
 LORD.

DEU 9:8  Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was
 angry with you to have destroyed you.

DEU 9:9  When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even
 the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the
 mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:

DEU 9:10  And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the
 finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the
 LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day
 of the assembly.

DEU 9:11  And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that
 the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.

DEU 9:12  And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence;
 for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted
 themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded
 them; they have made them a molten image.

DEU 9:13  Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this
 people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

DEU 9:14  Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from
 under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than
 they.

DEU 9:15  So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with
 fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.

DEU 9:16  And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your
 God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the
 way which the LORD had commanded you.

DEU 9:17  And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and
 brake them before your eyes.

DEU 9:18  And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and
 forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your
 sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke
 him to anger.

DEU 9:19  For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD
 was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that
 time also.

DEU 9:20  And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I
 prayed for Aaron also the same time.

DEU 9:21  And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with
 fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as
 dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the
 mount.

DEU 9:22  And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked
 the LORD to wrath.

DEU 9:23  Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and
 possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the
 commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to
 his voice.

DEU 9:24  Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew
 you.

DEU 9:25  Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I
 fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.

DEU 9:26  I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not
 thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy
 greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

DEU 9:27  Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the
 stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:

DEU 9:28  Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was
 not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he
 hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.

DEU 9:29  Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest
 out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.

DEU 10:1  At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like
 unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of
 wood.

DEU 10:2  And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first
 tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.

DEU 10:3  And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like
 unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine
 hand.

DEU 10:4  And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten
 commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst
 of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.

DEU 10:5  And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables
 in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.

DEU 10:6  And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the
 children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and
 Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.

DEU 10:7  From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
 Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

DEU 10:8  At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark
 of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto
 him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

DEU 10:9  Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the
 LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.

DEU 10:10  And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days
 and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the
 LORD would not destroy thee.

DEU 10:11  And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the
 people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their
 fathers to give unto them.

DEU 10:12  And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to
 fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve
 the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

DEU 10:13  To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I
 command thee this day for thy good?

DEU 10:14  Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy
 God, the earth also, with all that therein is.

DEU 10:15  Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he
 chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.

DEU 10:16  Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more
 stiffnecked.

DEU 10:17  For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great
 God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh
 reward:

DEU 10:18  He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth
 the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

DEU 10:19  Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of
 Egypt.

DEU 10:20  Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him
 shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

DEU 10:21  He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these
 great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

DEU 10:22  Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons;
 and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.

DEU 11:1  Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and
 his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.

DEU 11:2  And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have
 not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his
 greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,

DEU 11:3  And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt
 unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

DEU 11:4  And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and
 to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as
 they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;

DEU 11:5  And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this
 place;

DEU 11:6  And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of
 Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their
 households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their
 possession, in the midst of all Israel:

DEU 11:7  But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.

DEU 11:8  Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this
 day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to
 possess it;

DEU 11:9  And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware
 unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth
 with milk and honey.

DEU 11:10  For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the
 land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and
 wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:

DEU 11:11  But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and
 valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

DEU 11:12  A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy
 God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end
 of the year.

DEU 11:13  And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my
 commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to
 serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

DEU 11:14  That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the
 first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy
 wine, and thine oil.

DEU 11:15  And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest
 eat and be full.

DEU 11:16  Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye
 turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

DEU 11:17  And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the
 heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and
 lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.

DEU 11:18  Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your
 soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets
 between your eyes.

DEU 11:19  And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou
 sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest
 down, and when thou risest up.

DEU 11:20  And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and
 upon thy gates:

DEU 11:21  That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children,
 in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days
 of heaven upon the earth.

DEU 11:22  For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I
 command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways,
 and to cleave unto him;

DEU 11:23  Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and
 ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.

DEU 11:24  Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be
 yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates,
 even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.

DEU 11:25  There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your
 God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye
 shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.

DEU 11:26  Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

DEU 11:27  A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which
 I command you this day:

DEU 11:28  And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your
 God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after
 other gods, which ye have not known.

DEU 11:29  And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee
 in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the
 blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.

DEU 11:30  Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun
 goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over
 against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

DEU 11:31  For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the
 LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.

DEU 11:32  And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I
 set before you this day.

DEU 12:1  These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do
 in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all
 the days that ye live upon the earth.

DEU 12:2  Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye
 shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills,
 and under every green tree:

DEU 12:3  And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and
 burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their
 gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.

DEU 12:4  Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

DEU 12:5  But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all
 your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye
 seek, and thither thou shalt come:

DEU 12:6  And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices,
 and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your
 freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:

DEU 12:7  And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice
 in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD
 thy God hath blessed thee.

DEU 12:8  Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every
 man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

DEU 12:9  For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which
 the LORD your God giveth you.

DEU 12:10  But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD
 your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your
 enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;

DEU 12:11  Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to
 cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you;
 your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave
 offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:

DEU 12:12  And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons,
 and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the
 Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor
 inheritance with you.

DEU 12:13  Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in
 every place that thou seest:

DEU 12:14  But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy
 tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do
 all that I command thee.

DEU 12:15  Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,
 whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy
 God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as
 of the roebuck, and as of the hart.

DEU 12:16  Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as
 water.

DEU 12:17  Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of
 thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor
 any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave
 offering of thine hand:

DEU 12:18  But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which
 the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy
 manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and
 thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine
 hands unto.

DEU 12:19  Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as
 thou livest upon the earth.

DEU 12:20  When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised
 thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat
 flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

DEU 12:21  If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name
 there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy
 flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou
 shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

DEU 12:22  Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them:
 the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

DEU 12:23  Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life;
 and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

DEU 12:24  Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.

DEU 12:25  Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy
 children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight
 of the LORD.

DEU 12:26  Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt
 take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:

DEU 12:27  And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,
 upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be
 poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.

DEU 12:28  Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may
 go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest
 that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.

DEU 12:29  When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee,
 whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest
 in their land;

DEU 12:30  Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them,
 after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not
 after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so
 will I do likewise.

DEU 12:31  Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination
 to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their
 sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.

DEU 12:32  What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not
 add thereto, nor diminish from it.

DEU 13:1  If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and
 giveth thee a sign or a wonder,

DEU 13:2  And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee,
 saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us
 serve them;

DEU 13:3  Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that
 dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love
 the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

DEU 13:4  Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his
 commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto
 him.

DEU 13:5  And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death;
 because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought
 you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage,
 to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk
 in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.

DEU 13:6  If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter,
 or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice
 thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not
 known, thou, nor thy fathers;

DEU 13:7  Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh
 unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the
 other end of the earth;

DEU 13:8  Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall
 thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:

DEU 13:9  But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to
 put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.

DEU 13:10  And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath
 sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out
 of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

DEU 13:11  And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such
 wickedness as this is among you.

DEU 13:12  If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God
 hath given thee to dwell there, saying,

DEU 13:13  Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among
 you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and
 serve other gods, which ye have not known;

DEU 13:14  Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and,
 behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is
 wrought among you;

DEU 13:15  Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge
 of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle
 thereof, with the edge of the sword.

DEU 13:16  And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the
 street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof
 every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall
 not be built again.

DEU 13:17  And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand:
 that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee
 mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn
 unto thy fathers;

DEU 13:18  When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep
 all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right
 in the eyes of the LORD thy God.

DEU 14:1  Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut
 yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

DEU 14:2  For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath
 chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that
 are upon the earth.

DEU 14:3  Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.

DEU 14:4  These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the
 goat,

DEU 14:5  The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild
 goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

DEU 14:6  And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into
 two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.

DEU 14:7  Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or
 of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the
 coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are
 unclean unto you.

DEU 14:8  And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud,
 it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead
 carcase.

DEU 14:9  These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins
 and scales shall ye eat:

DEU 14:10  And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is
 unclean unto you.

DEU 14:11  Of all clean birds ye shall eat.

DEU 14:12  But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the
 ossifrage, and the ospray,

DEU 14:13  And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,

DEU 14:14  And every raven after his kind,

DEU 14:15  And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after
 his kind,

DEU 14:16  The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,

DEU 14:17  And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,

DEU 14:18  And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and
 the bat.

DEU 14:19  And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall
 not be eaten.

DEU 14:20  But of all clean fowls ye may eat.

DEU 14:21  Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt give
 it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest
 sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God.
 Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

DEU 14:22  Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field
 bringeth forth year by year.

DEU 14:23  And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he
 shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and
 of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou
 mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.

DEU 14:24  And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to
 carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall
 choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:

DEU 14:25  Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine
 hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:

DEU 14:26  And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth
 after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for
 whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy
 God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,

DEU 14:27  And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him;
 for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.

DEU 14:28  At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of
 thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:

DEU 14:29  And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,)
 and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy
 gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may
 bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.

DEU 15:1  At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.

DEU 15:2  And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth
 ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his
 neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release.

DEU 15:3  Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine
 with thy brother thine hand shall release;

DEU 15:4  Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall
 greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an
 inheritance to possess it:

DEU 15:5  Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to
 observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.

DEU 15:6  For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou
 shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign
 over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.

DEU 15:7  If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of
 thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not
 harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:

DEU 15:8  But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend
 him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.

DEU 15:9  Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The
 seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against
 thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD
 against thee, and it be sin unto thee.

DEU 15:10  Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved
 when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall
 bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.

DEU 15:11  For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command
 thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy
 poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

DEU 15:12  And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto
 thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him
 go free from thee.

DEU 15:13  And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him
 go away empty:

DEU 15:14  Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy
 floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath
 blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.

DEU 15:15  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of
 Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this
 thing to day.

DEU 15:16  And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee;
 because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;

DEU 15:17  Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the
 door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant
 thou shalt do likewise.

DEU 15:18  It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free
 from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving
 thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.

DEU 15:19  All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou
 shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the
 firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.

DEU 15:20  Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place
 which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.

DEU 15:21  And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or
 have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God.

DEU 15:22  Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person
 shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.

DEU 15:23  Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon
 the ground as water.

DEU 16:1  Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy
 God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of
 Egypt by night.

DEU 16:2  Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God,
 of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place
 his name there.

DEU 16:3  Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat
 unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest
 forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day
 when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.

DEU 16:4  And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast
 seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou
 sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.

DEU 16:5  Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which
 the LORD thy God giveth thee:

DEU 16:6  But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his
 name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down
 of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.

DEU 16:7  And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God
 shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.

DEU 16:8  Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day
 shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work
 therein.

DEU 16:9  Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven
 weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.

DEU 16:10  And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a
 tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the
 LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:

DEU 16:11  And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy
 son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
 Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and
 the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath
 chosen to place his name there.

DEU 16:12  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou
 shalt observe and do these statutes.

DEU 16:13  Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that
 thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:

DEU 16:14  And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy
 daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the
 stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.

DEU 16:15  Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God
 in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall
 bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands,
 therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

DEU 16:16  Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy
 God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and
 in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not
 appear before the LORD empty:

DEU 16:17  Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the
 LORD thy God which he hath given thee.

DEU 16:18  Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the
 LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the
 people with just judgment.

DEU 16:19  Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,
 neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert
 the words of the righteous.

DEU 16:20  That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest
 live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

DEU 16:21  Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar
 of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.

DEU 16:22  Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God
 hateth.

DEU 17:1  Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or sheep,
 wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination unto
 the LORD thy God.

DEU 17:2  If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD
 thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight
 of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant,

DEU 17:3  And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the
 sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;

DEU 17:4  And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired
 diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such
 abomination is wrought in Israel:

DEU 17:5  Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have
 committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and
 shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

DEU 17:6  At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is
 worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not
 be put to death.

DEU 17:7  The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to
 death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil
 away from among you.

DEU 17:8  If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood
 and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being
 matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee
 up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;

DEU 17:9  And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge
 that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the
 sentence of judgment:

DEU 17:10  And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that
 place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to
 do according to all that they inform thee:

DEU 17:11  According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach
 thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt
 do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee,
 to the right hand, nor to the left.

DEU 17:12  And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto
 the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto
 the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from
 Israel.

DEU 17:13  And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more
 presumptuously.

DEU 17:14  When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth
 thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will
 set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;

DEU 17:15  Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God
 shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou
 mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.

DEU 17:16  But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to
 return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the
 LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.

DEU 17:17  Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not
 away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.

DEU 17:18  And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom,
 that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is
 before the priests the Levites:

DEU 17:19  And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of
 his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words
 of this law and these statutes, to do them:

DEU 17:20  That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn
 not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end
 that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the
 midst of Israel.

DEU 18:1  The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no
 part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD
 made by fire, and his inheritance.

DEU 18:2  Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the
 LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

DEU 18:3  And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that
 offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the
 priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.

DEU 18:4  The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and
 the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.

DEU 18:5  For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand
 to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.

DEU 18:6  And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where
 he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which
 the LORD shall choose;

DEU 18:7  Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his
 brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.

DEU 18:8  They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the
 sale of his patrimony.

DEU 18:9  When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee,
 thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.

DEU 18:10  There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or
 his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an
 observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.

DEU 18:11  Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or
 a necromancer.

DEU 18:12  For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and
 because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from
 before thee.

DEU 18:13  Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.

DEU 18:14  For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto
 observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath
 not suffered thee so to do.

DEU 18:15  The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst
 of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;

DEU 18:16  According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb
 in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the
 LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.

DEU 18:17  And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they
 have spoken.

DEU 18:18  I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto
 thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all
 that I shall command him.

DEU 18:19  And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my
 words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.

DEU 18:20  But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name,
 which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of
 other gods, even that prophet shall die.

DEU 18:21  And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the
 LORD hath not spoken?

DEU 18:22  When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow
 not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but
 the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

DEU 19:1  When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD
 thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities,
 and in their houses;

DEU 19:2  Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land,
 which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.

DEU 19:3  Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land,
 which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every
 slayer may flee thither.

DEU 19:4  And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he
 may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time
 past;

DEU 19:5  As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and
 his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head
 slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he
 shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:

DEU 19:6  Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is
 hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was
 not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.

DEU 19:7  Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities
 for thee.

DEU 19:8  And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy
 fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy
 fathers;

DEU 19:9  If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command
 thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then
 shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:

DEU 19:10  That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God
 giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.

DEU 19:11  But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise
 up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one
 of these cities:

DEU 19:12  Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and
 deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.

DEU 19:13  Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of
 innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.

DEU 19:14  Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old
 time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that
 the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.

DEU 19:15  One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for
 any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the
 mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.

DEU 19:16  If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him
 that which is wrong;

DEU 19:17  Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand
 before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those
 days;

DEU 19:18  And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the
 witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;

DEU 19:19  Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his
 brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

DEU 19:20  And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth
 commit no more any such evil among you.

DEU 19:21  And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for
 eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

DEU 20:1  When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest
 horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for
 the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of
 Egypt.

DEU 20:2  And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the
 priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

DEU 20:3  And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto
 battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not
 tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;

DEU 20:4  For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you
 against your enemies, to save you.

DEU 20:5  And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is
 there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and
 return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.

DEU 20:6  And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet
 eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the
 battle, and another man eat of it.

DEU 20:7  And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken
 her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and
 another man take her.

DEU 20:8  And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall
 say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and
 return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart.

DEU 20:9  And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto
 the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.

DEU 20:10  When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim
 peace unto it.

DEU 20:11  And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto
 thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be
 tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.

DEU 20:12  And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against
 thee, then thou shalt besiege it:

DEU 20:13  And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou
 shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:

DEU 20:14  But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is
 in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and
 thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given
 thee.

DEU 20:15  Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from
 thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

DEU 20:16  But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give
 thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:

DEU 20:17  But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the
 Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites;
 as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:

DEU 20:18  That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which
 they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.

DEU 20:19  When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it
 to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe
 against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down
 (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:

DEU 20:20  Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat,
 thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against
 the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.

DEU 21:1  If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
 to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him:

DEU 21:2  Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall
 measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:

DEU 21:3  And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even
 the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought
 with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;

DEU 21:4  And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough
 valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's
 neck there in the valley:

DEU 21:5  And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD
 thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the
 LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:

DEU 21:6  And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man,
 shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:

DEU 21:7  And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood,
 neither have our eyes seen it.

DEU 21:8  Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast
 redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And
 the blood shall be forgiven them.

DEU 21:9  So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you,
 when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.

DEU 21:10  When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy
 God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,

DEU 21:11  And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire
 unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

DEU 21:12  Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall shave
 her head, and pare her nails;

DEU 21:13  And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and
 shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full
 month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she
 shall be thy wife.

DEU 21:14  And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let
 her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou
 shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.

DEU 21:15  If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they
 have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn
 son be hers that was hated:

DEU 21:16  Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he
 hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son
 of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:

DEU 21:17  But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by
 giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of
 his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.

DEU 21:18  If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the
 voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have
 chastened him, will not hearken unto them:

DEU 21:19  Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him
 out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;

DEU 21:20  And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is
 stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a
 drunkard.

DEU 21:21  And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he
 die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall
 hear, and fear.

DEU 21:22  And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be
 put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:

DEU 21:23  His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in
 any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that
 thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an
 inheritance.

DEU 22:1  Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide
 thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.

DEU 22:2  And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him
 not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee
 until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.

DEU 22:3  In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with
 his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath
 lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide
 thyself.

DEU 22:4  Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the
 way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up
 again.

DEU 22:5  The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither
 shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto
 the LORD thy God.

DEU 22:6  If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or
 on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon
 the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:

DEU 22:7  But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young
 to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy
 days.

DEU 22:8  When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for
 thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from
 thence.

DEU 22:9  Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of
 thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.

DEU 22:10  Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

DEU 22:11  Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and
 linen together.

DEU 22:12  Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture,
 wherewith thou coverest thyself.

DEU 22:13  If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

DEU 22:14  And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name
 upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not
 a maid:

DEU 22:15  Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring
 forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the
 gate:

DEU 22:16  And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my
 daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;

DEU 22:17  And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I
 found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's
 virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.

DEU 22:18  And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;

DEU 22:19  And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give
 them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name
 upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away
 all his days.

DEU 22:20  But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found
 for the damsel:

DEU 22:21  Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's
 house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die:
 because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's
 house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.

DEU 22:22  If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then
 they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the
 woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.

DEU 22:23  If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man
 find her in the city, and lie with her;

DEU 22:24  Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye
 shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried
 not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's
 wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.

DEU 22:25  But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force
 her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.

DEU 22:26  But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no
 sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and
 slayeth him, even so is this matter:

DEU 22:27  For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and
 there was none to save her.

DEU 22:28  If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and
 lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;

DEU 22:29  Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father
 fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled
 her, he may not put her away all his days.

DEU 22:30  A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's
 skirt.

DEU 23:1  He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off,
 shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

DEU 23:2  A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to
 his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

DEU 23:3  An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the
 LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the
 congregation of the LORD for ever:

DEU 23:4  Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when
 ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the
 son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.

DEU 23:5  Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the
 LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy
 God loved thee.

DEU 23:6  Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for
 ever.

DEU 23:7  Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt
 not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.

DEU 23:8  The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the
 congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

DEU 23:9  When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from
 every wicked thing.

DEU 23:10  If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of
 uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the
 camp, he shall not come within the camp:

DEU 23:11  But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with
 water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.

DEU 23:12  Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go
 forth abroad:

DEU 23:13  And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when
 thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back
 and cover that which cometh from thee:

DEU 23:14  For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver
 thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be
 holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.

DEU 23:15  Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped
 from his master unto thee:

DEU 23:16  He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he
 shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not
 oppress him.

DEU 23:17  There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite
 of the sons of Israel.

DEU 23:18  Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog,
 into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these are
 abomination unto the LORD thy God.

DEU 23:19  Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury
 of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:

DEU 23:20  Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother
 thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all
 that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.

DEU 23:21  When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not
 slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it
 would be sin in thee.

DEU 23:22  But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

DEU 23:23  That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even
 a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God,
 which thou hast promised with thy mouth.

DEU 23:24  When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat
 grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy
 vessel.

DEU 23:25  When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou
 mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto
 thy neighbour's standing corn.

DEU 24:1  When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass
 that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness
 in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her
 hand, and send her out of his house.

DEU 24:2  And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another
 man's wife.

DEU 24:3  And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of
 divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or
 if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;

DEU 24:4  Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be
 his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD:
 and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
 for an inheritance.

DEU 24:5  When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither
 shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one
 year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.

DEU 24:6  No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he
 taketh a man's life to pledge.

DEU 24:7  If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of
 Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall
 die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.

DEU 24:8  Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and
 do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I
 commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.

DEU 24:9  Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that
 ye were come forth out of Egypt.

DEU 24:10  When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into
 his house to fetch his pledge.

DEU 24:11  Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall
 bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.

DEU 24:12  And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:

DEU 24:13  In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun
 goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it
 shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.

DEU 24:14  Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy,
 whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land
 within thy gates:

DEU 24:15  At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go
 down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry
 against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.

DEU 24:16  The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither
 shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to
 death for his own sin.

DEU 24:17  Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the
 fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:

DEU 24:18  But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the
 LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

DEU 24:19  When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a
 sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the
 stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may
 bless thee in all the work of thine hands.

DEU 24:20  When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the
 boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the
 widow.

DEU 24:21  When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean
 it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the
 widow.

DEU 24:22  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of
 Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

DEU 25:1  If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment,
 that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and
 condemn the wicked.

DEU 25:2  And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the
 judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face,
 according to his fault, by a certain number.

DEU 25:3  Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should
 exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should
 seem vile unto thee.

DEU 25:4  Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.

DEU 25:5  If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no
 child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her
 husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and
 perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.

DEU 25:6  And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed
 in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of
 Israel.

DEU 25:7  And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his
 brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's
 brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not
 perform the duty of my husband's brother.

DEU 25:8  Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and
 if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;

DEU 25:9  Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the
 elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall
 answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his
 brother's house.

DEU 25:10  And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath
 his shoe loosed.

DEU 25:11  When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one
 draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth
 him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:

DEU 25:12  Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her.

DEU 25:13  Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.

DEU 25:14  Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a
 small.

DEU 25:15  But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just
 measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which
 the LORD thy God giveth thee.

DEU 25:16  For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an
 abomination unto the LORD thy God.

DEU 25:17  Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come
 forth out of Egypt;

DEU 25:18  How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all
 that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared
 not God.

DEU 25:19  Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest
 from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
 thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the
 remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.

DEU 26:1  And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD
 thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest
 therein;

DEU 26:2  That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth,
 which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and
 shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God
 shall choose to place his name there.

DEU 26:3  And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and
 say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto
 the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us.

DEU 26:4  And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it
 down before the altar of the LORD thy God.

DEU 26:5  And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready
 to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there
 with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:

DEU 26:6  And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon
 us hard bondage:

DEU 26:7  And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard
 our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression:

DEU 26:8  And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and
 with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and
 with wonders:

DEU 26:9  And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land,
 even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

DEU 26:10  And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which
 thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy
 God, and worship before the LORD thy God:

DEU 26:11  And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God
 hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the
 stranger that is among you.

DEU 26:12  When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
 increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto
 the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat
 within thy gates, and be filled;

DEU 26:13  Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the
 hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the
 Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according
 to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed
 thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

DEU 26:14  I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away
 ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but
 I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to
 all that thou hast commanded me.

DEU 26:15  Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy
 people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto
 our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

DEU 26:16  This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes
 and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine
 heart, and with all thy soul.

DEU 26:17  Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in
 his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,
 and to hearken unto his voice:

DEU 26:18  And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people,
 as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;

DEU 26:19  And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in
 praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people
 unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

DEU 27:1  And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying,
 Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.

DEU 27:2  And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the
 land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great
 stones, and plaister them with plaister:

DEU 27:3  And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou
 art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God
 giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy
 fathers hath promised thee.

DEU 27:4  Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set
 up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt
 plaister them with plaister.

DEU 27:5  And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar
 of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.

DEU 27:6  Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and
 thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God:

DEU 27:7  And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and
 rejoice before the LORD thy God.

DEU 27:8  And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very
 plainly.

DEU 27:9  And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying,
 Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the
 LORD thy God.

DEU 27:10  Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do his
 commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.

DEU 27:11  And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

DEU 27:12  These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye
 are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and
 Joseph, and Benjamin:

DEU 27:13  And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and
 Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

DEU 27:14  And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with
 a loud voice,

DEU 27:15  Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an
 abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and
 putteth it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.

DEU 27:16  Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all
 the people shall say, Amen.

DEU 27:17  Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all the
 people shall say, Amen.

DEU 27:18  Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all
 the people shall say, Amen.

DEU 27:19  Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
 fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

DEU 27:20  Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he
 uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.

DEU 27:21  Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people
 shall say, Amen.

DEU 27:22  Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father,
 or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.

DEU 27:23  Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the people
 shall say, Amen.

DEU 27:24  Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the people
 shall say, Amen.

DEU 27:25  Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And all
 the people shall say, Amen.

DEU 27:26  Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do
 them. And all the people shall say, Amen.

DEU 28:1  And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the
 voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I
 command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all
 nations of the earth:

DEU 28:2  And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if
 thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.

DEU 28:3  Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the
 field.

DEU 28:4  Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
 ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks
 of thy sheep.

DEU 28:5  Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

DEU 28:6  Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be
 when thou goest out.

DEU 28:7  The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be
 smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee
 before thee seven ways.

DEU 28:8  The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and
 in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land
 which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

DEU 28:9  The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath
 sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and
 walk in his ways.

DEU 28:10  And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the
 name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

DEU 28:11  And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy
 body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the
 land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

DEU 28:12  The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give
 the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine
 hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.

DEU 28:13  And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou
 shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto
 the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to
 observe and to do them:

DEU 28:14  And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command
 thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to
 serve them.

DEU 28:15  But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice
 of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes
 which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon
 thee, and overtake thee:

DEU 28:16  Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the
 field.

DEU 28:17  Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

DEU 28:18  Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
 land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

DEU 28:19  Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be
 when thou goest out.

DEU 28:20  The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all
 that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and
 until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby
 thou hast forsaken me.

DEU 28:21  The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have
 consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.

DEU 28:22  The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and
 with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and
 with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish.

DEU 28:23  And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth
 that is under thee shall be iron.

DEU 28:24  The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from
 heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

DEU 28:25  The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou
 shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt
 be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.

DEU 28:26  And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto
 the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.

DEU 28:27  The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the
 emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be
 healed.

DEU 28:28  The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
 astonishment of heart:

DEU 28:29  And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in
 darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only
 oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.

DEU 28:30  Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou
 shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a
 vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.

DEU 28:31  Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat
 thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and
 shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies,
 and thou shalt have none to rescue them.

DEU 28:32  Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and
 thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and
 there shall be no might in thine hand.

DEU 28:33  The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which
 thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:

DEU 28:34  So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou
 shalt see.

DEU 28:35  The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore
 botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy
 head.

DEU 28:36  The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over
 thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there
 shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.

DEU 28:37  And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,
 among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.

DEU 28:38  Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but
 little in; for the locust shall consume it.

DEU 28:39  Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink
 of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.

DEU 28:40  Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou
 shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.

DEU 28:41  Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them;
 for they shall go into captivity.

DEU 28:42  All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.

DEU 28:43  The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high;
 and thou shalt come down very low.

DEU 28:44  He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be
 the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

DEU 28:45  Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue
 thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not
 unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes
 which he commanded thee:

DEU 28:46  And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon
 thy seed for ever.

DEU 28:47  Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with
 gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

DEU 28:48  Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send
 against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all
 things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have
 destroyed thee.

DEU 28:49  The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end
 of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt
 not understand;

DEU 28:50  A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person
 of the old, nor shew favour to the young:

DEU 28:51  And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land,
 until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine,
 or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have
 destroyed thee.

DEU 28:52  And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and
 fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and
 he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the
 LORD thy God hath given thee.

DEU 28:53  And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy
 sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the
 siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:

DEU 28:54  So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye
 shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and
 toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:

DEU 28:55  So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children
 whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the
 straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.

DEU 28:56  The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure
 to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness,
 her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her
 son, and toward her daughter,

DEU 28:57  And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and
 toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of
 all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall
 distress thee in thy gates.

DEU 28:58  If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are
 written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name,
 THE LORD THY GOD;

DEU 28:59  Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of
 thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore
 sicknesses, and of long continuance.

DEU 28:60  Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which
 thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

DEU 28:61  Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the
 book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be
 destroyed.

DEU 28:62  And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of
 heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD
 thy God.

DEU 28:63  And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do
 you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy
 you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land
 whither thou goest to possess it.

DEU 28:64  And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end
 of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods,
 which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.

DEU 28:65  And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the
 sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling
 heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:

DEU 28:66  And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear
 day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:

DEU 28:67  In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even
 thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart
 wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt
 see.

DEU 28:68  And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the
 way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye
 shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall
 buy you.

DEU 29:1  These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses
 to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant
 which he made with them in Horeb.

DEU 29:2  And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen
 all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and
 unto all his servants, and unto all his land;

DEU 29:3  The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and
 those great miracles:

DEU 29:4  Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to
 see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

DEU 29:5  And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are
 not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.

DEU 29:6  Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink:
 that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.

DEU 29:7  And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og
 the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:

DEU 29:8  And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the
 Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.

DEU 29:9  Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may
 prosper in all that ye do.

DEU 29:10  Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains
 of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,

DEU 29:11  Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp,
 from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:

DEU 29:12  That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and
 into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:

DEU 29:13  That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and
 that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath
 sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

DEU 29:14  Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;

DEU 29:15  But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our
 God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:

DEU 29:16  (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came
 through the nations which ye passed by;

DEU 29:17  And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and
 stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)

DEU 29:18  Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe,
 whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the
 gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth
 gall and wormwood;

DEU 29:19  And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that
 he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk
 in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:

DEU 29:20  The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his
 jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in
 this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under
 heaven.

DEU 29:21  And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of
 Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this
 book of the law:

DEU 29:22  So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up
 after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when
 they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath
 laid upon it;

DEU 29:23  And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning,
 that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the
 overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew
 in his anger, and in his wrath:

DEU 29:24  Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto
 this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?

DEU 29:25  Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the
 LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth
 out of the land of Egypt:

DEU 29:26  For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom
 they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:

DEU 29:27  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring
 upon it all the curses that are written in this book:

DEU 29:28  And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
 wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is
 this day.

DEU 29:29  The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things
 which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may
 do all the words of this law.

DEU 30:1  And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon
 thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou
 shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath
 driven thee,

DEU 30:2  And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice
 according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with
 all thine heart, and with all thy soul;

DEU 30:3  That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have
 compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations,
 whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

DEU 30:4  If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from
 thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:

DEU 30:5  And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers
 possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply
 thee above thy fathers.

DEU 30:6  And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of
 thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy
 soul, that thou mayest live.

DEU 30:7  And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies,
 and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

DEU 30:8  And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his
 commandments which I command thee this day.

DEU 30:9  And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine
 hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the
 fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for
 good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:

DEU 30:10  If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep
 his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the
 law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with
 all thy soul.

DEU 30:11  For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden
 from thee, neither is it far off.

DEU 30:12  It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us
 to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

DEU 30:13  Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go
 over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

DEU 30:14  But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart,
 that thou mayest do it.

DEU 30:15  See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and
 evil;

DEU 30:16  In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in
 his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments,
 that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee
 in the land whither thou goest to possess it.

DEU 30:17  But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt
 be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

DEU 30:18  I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that
 ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over
 Jordan to go to possess it.

DEU 30:19  I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have
 set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life,
 that both thou and thy seed may live:

DEU 30:20  That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey
 his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the
 length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware
 unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

DEU 31:1  And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

DEU 31:2  And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day;
 I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt
 not go over this Jordan.

DEU 31:3  The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy
 these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he
 shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.

DEU 31:4  And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings
 of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.

DEU 31:5  And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto
 them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.

DEU 31:6  Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for
 the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor
 forsake thee.

DEU 31:7  And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all
 Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people
 unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and
 thou shalt cause them to inherit it.

DEU 31:8  And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with
 thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be
 dismayed.

DEU 31:9  And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons
 of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the
 elders of Israel.

DEU 31:10  And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years,
 in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,

DEU 31:11  When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the
 place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel
 in their hearing.

DEU 31:12  Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy
 stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may
 learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this
 law:

DEU 31:13  And that their children, which have not known any thing, may
 hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land
 whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

DEU 31:14  And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou
 must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the
 congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and
 presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.

DEU 31:15  And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and
 the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.

DEU 31:16  And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy
 fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the
 strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake
 me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.

DEU 31:17  Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will
 forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be
 devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will
 say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not
 among us?

DEU 31:18  And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which
 they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.

DEU 31:19  Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children
 of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me
 against the children of Israel.

DEU 31:20  For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto
 their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten
 and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods,
 and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.

DEU 31:21  And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen
 them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall
 not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their
 imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into
 the land which I sware.

DEU 31:22  Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the
 children of Israel.

DEU 31:23  And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and
 of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land
 which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.

DEU 31:24  And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words
 of this law in a book, until they were finished,

DEU 31:25  That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant
 of the LORD, saying,

DEU 31:26  Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the
 covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against
 thee.

DEU 31:27  For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet
 alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how
 much more after my death?

DEU 31:28  Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,
 that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to
 record against them.

DEU 31:29  For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves,
 and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall
 you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to
 provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

DEU 31:30  And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the
 words of this song, until they were ended.

DEU 32:1  Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the
 words of my mouth.

DEU 32:2  My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the
 dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the
 grass:

DEU 32:3  Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness
 unto our God.

DEU 32:4  He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a
 God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.

DEU 32:5  They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his
 children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

DEU 32:6  Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he
 thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established
 thee?

DEU 32:7  Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask
 thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.

DEU 32:8  When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he
 separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the
 number of the children of Israel.

DEU 32:9  For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
 inheritance.

DEU 32:10  He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness;
 he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.

DEU 32:11  As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
 spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:

DEU 32:12  So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with
 him.

DEU 32:13  He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat
 the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the
 rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

DEU 32:14  Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams
 of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou
 didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

DEU 32:15  But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art
 grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made
 him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

DEU 32:16  They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations
 provoked they him to anger.

DEU 32:17  They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not,
 to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.

DEU 32:18  Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten
 God that formed thee.

DEU 32:19  And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking
 of his sons, and of his daughters.

DEU 32:20  And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their
 end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no
 faith.

DEU 32:21  They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have
 provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy
 with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a
 foolish nation.

DEU 32:22  For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest
 hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the
 foundations of the mountains.

DEU 32:23  I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.

DEU 32:24  They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and
 with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with
 the poison of serpents of the dust.

DEU 32:25  The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young
 man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.

DEU 32:26  I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
 remembrance of them to cease from among men:

DEU 32:27  Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
 adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our
 hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.

DEU 32:28  For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
 understanding in them.

DEU 32:29  O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would
 consider their latter end!

DEU 32:30  How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,
 except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?

DEU 32:31  For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being
 judges.

DEU 32:32  For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
 Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:

DEU 32:33  Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.

DEU 32:34  Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
 treasures?

DEU 32:35  To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in
 due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall
 come upon them make haste.

DEU 32:36  For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his
 servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up,
 or left.

DEU 32:37  And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they
 trusted,

DEU 32:38  Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine
 of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your
 protection.

DEU 32:39  See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
 kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can
 deliver out of my hand.

DEU 32:40  For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

DEU 32:41  If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment;
 I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.

DEU 32:42  I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour
 flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the
 beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

DEU 32:43  Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood
 of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be
 merciful unto his land, and to his people.

DEU 32:44  And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears
 of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

DEU 32:45  And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:

DEU 32:46  And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I
 testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe
 to do, all the words of this law.

DEU 32:47  For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and
 through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over
 Jordan to possess it.

DEU 32:48  And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

DEU 32:49  Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is
 in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of
 Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:

DEU 32:50  And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy
 people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his
 people:

DEU 32:51  Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the
 waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me
 not in the midst of the children of Israel.

DEU 32:52  Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
 thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

DEU 33:1  And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the
 children of Israel before his death.

DEU 33:2  And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto
 them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of
 saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.

DEU 33:3  Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they
 sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.

DEU 33:4  Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of
 Jacob.

DEU 33:5  And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the
 tribes of Israel were gathered together.

DEU 33:6  Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

DEU 33:7  And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice
 of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him;
 and be thou an help to him from his enemies.

DEU 33:8  And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy
 one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the
 waters of Meribah;

DEU 33:9  Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him;
 neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they
 have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.

DEU 33:10  They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall
 put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.

DEU 33:11  Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite
 through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him,
 that they rise not again.

DEU 33:12  And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in
 safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall
 dwell between his shoulders.

DEU 33:13  And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the
 precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth
 beneath,

DEU 33:14  And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the
 precious things put forth by the moon,

DEU 33:15  And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the
 precious things of the lasting hills,

DEU 33:16  And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and
 for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon
 the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated
 from his brethren.

DEU 33:17  His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are
 like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together
 to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they
 are the thousands of Manasseh.

DEU 33:18  And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,
 Issachar, in thy tents.

DEU 33:19  They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer
 sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the
 seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

DEU 33:20  And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as
 a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.

DEU 33:21  And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a
 portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the
 people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.

DEU 33:22  And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from
 Bashan.

DEU 33:23  And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full
 with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.

DEU 33:24  And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be
 acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.

DEU 33:25  Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy
 strength be.

DEU 33:26  There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the
 heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

DEU 33:27  The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting
 arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say,
 Destroy them.

DEU 33:28  Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall
 be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.

DEU 33:29  Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by
 the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and
 thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their
 high places.

DEU 34:1  And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo,
 to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him
 all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

DEU 34:2  And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the
 land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

DEU 34:3  And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of
 palm trees, unto Zoar.

DEU 34:4  And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto
 Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I
 have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over
 thither.

DEU 34:5  So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,
 according to the word of the LORD.

DEU 34:6  And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against
 Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.

DEU 34:7  And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye
 was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

DEU 34:8  And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
 thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.

DEU 34:9  And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses
 had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto
 him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.

DEU 34:10  And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom
 the LORD knew face to face,

DEU 34:11  In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do
 in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his
 land,

DEU 34:12  And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses
 shewed in the sight of all Israel.

JDG 1:1  Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of
 Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites
 first, to fight against them?

JDG 1:2  And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the
 land into his hand.

JDG 1:3  And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot,
 that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee
 into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.

JDG 1:4  And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the
 Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.

JDG 1:5  And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and
 they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

JDG 1:6  But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and
 cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

JDG 1:7  And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and
 their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done,
 so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he
 died.

JDG 1:8  Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken
 it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.

JDG 1:9  And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the
 Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.

JDG 1:10  And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the
 name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and
 Ahiman, and Talmai.

JDG 1:11  And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the
 name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:

JDG 1:12  And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him
 will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

JDG 1:13  And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and
 he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

JDG 1:14  And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask
 of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto
 her, What wilt thou?

JDG 1:15  And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a
 south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper
 springs and the nether springs.

JDG 1:16  And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out
 of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of
 Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the
 people.

JDG 1:17  And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites
 that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city
 was called Hormah.

JDG 1:18  Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the
 coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

JDG 1:19  And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the
 mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they
 had chariots of iron.

JDG 1:20  And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled
 thence the three sons of Anak.

JDG 1:21  And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that
 inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in
 Jerusalem unto this day.

JDG 1:22  And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the
 LORD was with them.

JDG 1:23  And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the
 city before was Luz.)

JDG 1:24  And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said
 unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew
 thee mercy.

JDG 1:25  And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the
 city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.

JDG 1:26  And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and
 called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.

JDG 1:27  Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her
 towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns,
 nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo
 and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

JDG 1:28  And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
 Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

JDG 1:29  Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but
 the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

JDG 1:30  Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
 inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became
 tributaries.

JDG 1:31  Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
 inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of
 Aphik, nor of Rehob:

JDG 1:32  But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the
 land: for they did not drive them out.

JDG 1:33  Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor
 the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the
 inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of
 Bethanath became tributaries unto them.

JDG 1:34  And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for
 they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:

JDG 1:35  But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
 Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became
 tributaries.

JDG 1:36  And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from
 the rock, and upward.

JDG 2:1  And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I
 made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I
 sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.

JDG 2:2  And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye
 shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye
 done this?

JDG 2:3  Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but
 they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto
 you.

JDG 2:4  And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto
 all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.

JDG 2:5  And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed
 there unto the LORD.

JDG 2:6  And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went
 every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

JDG 2:7  And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
 days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works
 of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

JDG 2:8  And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an
 hundred and ten years old.

JDG 2:9  And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres,
 in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.

JDG 2:10  And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and
 there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet
 the works which he had done for Israel.

JDG 2:11  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
 served Baalim:

JDG 2:12  And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them
 out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people
 that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the
 LORD to anger.

JDG 2:13  And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

JDG 2:14  And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered
 them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the
 hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand
 before their enemies.

JDG 2:15  Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them
 for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they
 were greatly distressed.

JDG 2:16  Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out
 of the hand of those that spoiled them.

JDG 2:17  And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a
 whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly
 out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the
 LORD; but they did not so.

JDG 2:18  And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the
 judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days
 of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason
 of them that oppressed them and vexed them.

JDG 2:19  And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and
 corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to
 serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings,
 nor from their stubborn way.

JDG 2:20  And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
 Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded
 their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;

JDG 2:21  I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the
 nations which Joshua left when he died:

JDG 2:22  That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way
 of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.

JDG 2:23  Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out
 hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.

JDG 3:1  Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by
 them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;

JDG 3:2  Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to
 teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;

JDG 3:3  Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the
 Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon
 unto the entering in of Hamath.

JDG 3:4  And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would
 hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers
 by the hand of Moses.

JDG 3:5  And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and
 Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:

JDG 3:6  And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their
 daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

JDG 3:7  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
 forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.

JDG 3:8  Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
 them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children
 of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.

JDG 3:9  And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised
 up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel
 the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

JDG 3:10  And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and
 went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia
 into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.

JDG 3:11  And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.

JDG 3:12  And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD:
 and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they
 had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

JDG 3:13  And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went
 and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

JDG 3:14  So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
 years.

JDG 3:15  But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised
 them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and
 by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

JDG 3:16  But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length;
 and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.

JDG 3:17  And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a
 very fat man.

JDG 3:18  And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the
 people that bare the present.

JDG 3:19  But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
 Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep
 silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.

JDG 3:20  And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which
 he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee.
 And he arose out of his seat.

JDG 3:21  And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right
 thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

JDG 3:22  And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon
 the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the
 dirt came out.

JDG 3:23  Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the
 parlour upon him, and locked them.

JDG 3:24  When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,
 behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth
 his feet in his summer chamber.

JDG 3:25  And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not
 the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and,
 behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.

JDG 3:26  And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
 quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

JDG 3:27  And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the
 mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the
 mount, and he before them.

JDG 3:28  And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered
 your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and
 took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.

JDG 3:29  And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
 lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

JDG 3:30  So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land
 had rest fourscore years.

JDG 3:31  And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
 Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.

JDG 4:1  And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD,
 when Ehud was dead.

JDG 4:2  And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that
 reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in
 Harosheth of the Gentiles.

JDG 4:3  And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine
 hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children
 of Israel.

JDG 4:4  And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at
 that time.

JDG 4:5  And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel
 in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.

JDG 4:6  And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
 Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded,
 saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men
 of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?

JDG 4:7  And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of
 Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him
 into thine hand.

JDG 4:8  And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but
 if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

JDG 4:9  And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey
 that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell
 Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to
 Kedesh.

JDG 4:10  And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with
 ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.

JDG 4:11  Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father
 in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent
 unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.

JDG 4:12  And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to
 mount Tabor.

JDG 4:13  And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
 chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth
 of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

JDG 4:14  And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the
 LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before
 thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

JDG 4:15  And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his
 host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down
 off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.

JDG 4:16  But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
 Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge
 of the sword; and there was not a man left.

JDG 4:17  Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of
 Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the
 house of Heber the Kenite.

JDG 4:18  And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my
 lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the
 tent, she covered him with a mantle.

JDG 4:19  And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink;
 for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and
 covered him.

JDG 4:20  Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall
 be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man
 here? that thou shalt say, No.

JDG 4:21  Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in
 her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and
 fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.

JDG 4:22  And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and
 said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when
 he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his
 temples.

JDG 4:23  So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
 children of Israel.

JDG 4:24  And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed
 against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of
 Canaan.

JDG 5:1  Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,

JDG 5:2  Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people
 willingly offered themselves.

JDG 5:3  Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto
 the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.

JDG 5:4  LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the
 field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also
 dropped water.

JDG 5:5  The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before
 the LORD God of Israel.

JDG 5:6  In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the
 highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.

JDG 5:7  The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until
 that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

JDG 5:8  They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or
 spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

JDG 5:9  My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves
 willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

JDG 5:10  Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk
 by the way.

JDG 5:11  They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of
 drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even
 the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then
 shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.

JDG 5:12  Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and
 lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

JDG 5:13  Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among
 the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.

JDG 5:14  Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee,
 Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of
 Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.

JDG 5:15  And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and
 also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben
 there were great thoughts of heart.

JDG 5:16  Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the
 flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.

JDG 5:17  Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher
 continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

JDG 5:18  Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto
 the death in the high places of the field.

JDG 5:19  The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach
 by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

JDG 5:20  They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against
 Sisera.

JDG 5:21  The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river
 Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

JDG 5:22  Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the
 pransings of their mighty ones.

JDG 5:23  Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the
 inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the
 help of the LORD against the mighty.

JDG 5:24  Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,
 blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

JDG 5:25  He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a
 lordly dish.

JDG 5:26  She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's
 hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when
 she had pierced and stricken through his temples.

JDG 5:27  At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he
 fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

JDG 5:28  The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the
 lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his
 chariots?

JDG 5:29  Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,

JDG 5:30  Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a
 damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours
 of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the
 necks of them that take the spoil?

JDG 5:31  So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him
 be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty
 years.

JDG 6:1  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the
 LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.

JDG 6:2  And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the
 Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the
 mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

JDG 6:3  And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and
 the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;

JDG 6:4  And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the
 earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither
 sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

JDG 6:5  For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as
 grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without
 number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.

JDG 6:6  And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the
 children of Israel cried unto the LORD.

JDG 6:7  And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD
 because of the Midianites,

JDG 6:8  That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said
 unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from
 Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;

JDG 6:9  And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the
 hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave
 you their land;

JDG 6:10  And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the
 Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.

JDG 6:11  And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was
 in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon
 threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.

JDG 6:12  And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The
 LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

JDG 6:13  And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why
 then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers
 told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD
 hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

JDG 6:14  And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and
 thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?

JDG 6:15  And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel?
 behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's
 house.

JDG 6:16  And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou
 shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

JDG 6:17  And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then
 shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

JDG 6:18  Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring
 forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until
 thou come again.

JDG 6:19  And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an
 ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a
 pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.

JDG 6:20  And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened
 cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.

JDG 6:21  Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in
 his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up
 fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then
 the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.

JDG 6:22  And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon
 said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to
 face.

JDG 6:23  And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt
 not die.

JDG 6:24  Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
 Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

JDG 6:25  And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take
 thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and
 throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove
 that is by it:

JDG 6:26  And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock,
 in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt
 sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.

JDG 6:27  Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had
 said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and
 the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.

JDG 6:28  And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the
 altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and
 the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.

JDG 6:29  And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they
 enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.

JDG 6:30  Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he
 may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut
 down the grove that was by it.

JDG 6:31  And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for
 Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death
 whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because
 one hath cast down his altar.

JDG 6:32  Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead
 against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

JDG 6:33  Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the
 east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of
 Jezreel.

JDG 6:34  But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet;
 and Abiezer was gathered after him.

JDG 6:35  And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered
 after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto
 Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.

JDG 6:36  And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as
 thou hast said,

JDG 6:37  Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be
 on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I
 know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.

JDG 6:38  And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the
 fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.

JDG 6:39  And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and
 I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the
 fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let
 there be dew.

JDG 6:40  And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and
 there was dew on all the ground.

JDG 7:1  Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him,
 rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the
 Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the
 valley.

JDG 7:2  And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too
 many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt
 themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.

JDG 7:3  Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
 Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount
 Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there
 remained ten thousand.

JDG 7:4  And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them
 down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be,
 that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with
 thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the
 same shall not go.

JDG 7:5  So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto
 Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog
 lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down
 upon his knees to drink.

JDG 7:6  And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth,
 were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their
 knees to drink water.

JDG 7:7  And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped
 will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the
 other people go every man unto his place.

JDG 7:8  So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he
 sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three
 hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.

JDG 7:9  And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,
 Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.

JDG 7:10  But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down
 to the host:

JDG 7:11  And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be
 strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his
 servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.

JDG 7:12  And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the
 east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their
 camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.

JDG 7:13  And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream
 unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of
 barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote
 it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.

JDG 7:14  And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword
 of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God
 delivered Midian, and all the host.

JDG 7:15  And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the
 interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of
 Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host
 of Midian.

JDG 7:16  And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put
 a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the
 pitchers.

JDG 7:17  And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when
 I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.

JDG 7:18  When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye
 the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the
 LORD, and of Gideon.

JDG 7:19  So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the
 outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but
 newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that
 were in their hands.

JDG 7:20  And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers,
 and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands
 to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

JDG 7:21  And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all
 the host ran, and cried, and fled.

JDG 7:22  And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's
 sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to
 Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

JDG 7:23  And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
 Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the
 Midianites.

JDG 7:24  And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come
 down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah
 and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and
 took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.

JDG 7:25  And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they
 slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of
 Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on
 the other side Jordan.

JDG 8:1  And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus,
 that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites?
 And they did chide with him sharply.

JDG 8:2  And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is
 not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?

JDG 8:3  God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and
 Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was
 abated toward him, when he had said that.

JDG 8:4  And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred
 men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

JDG 8:5  And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread
 unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after
 Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

JDG 8:6  And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna
 now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?

JDG 8:7  And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and
 Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the
 wilderness and with briers.

JDG 8:8  And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the
 men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.

JDG 8:9  And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in
 peace, I will break down this tower.

JDG 8:10  Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them,
 about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the
 children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that
 drew sword.

JDG 8:11  And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east
 of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.

JDG 8:12  And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the
 two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.

JDG 8:13  And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was
 up,

JDG 8:14  And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him:
 and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof,
 even threescore and seventeen men.

JDG 8:15  And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and
 Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and
 Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are
 weary?

JDG 8:16  And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and
 briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.

JDG 8:17  And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.

JDG 8:18  Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they
 whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one
 resembled the children of a king.

JDG 8:19  And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as
 the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.

JDG 8:20  And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the
 youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.

JDG 8:21  Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the
 man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and
 Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.

JDG 8:22  Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both
 thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from
 the hand of Midian.

JDG 8:23  And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my
 son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.

JDG 8:24  And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye
 would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden
 earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

JDG 8:25  And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a
 garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.

JDG 8:26  And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
 thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars,
 and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains
 that were about their camels' necks.

JDG 8:27  And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in
 Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a
 snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

JDG 8:28  Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they
 lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years
 in the days of Gideon.

JDG 8:29  And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.

JDG 8:30  And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he
 had many wives.

JDG 8:31  And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose
 name he called Abimelech.

JDG 8:32  And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried
 in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

JDG 8:33  And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of
 Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith
 their god.

JDG 8:34  And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had
 delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:

JDG 8:35  Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely,
 Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.

JDG 9:1  And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's
 brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his
 mother's father, saying,

JDG 9:2  Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is
 better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore
 and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also
 that I am your bone and your flesh.

JDG 9:3  And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of
 Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for
 they said, He is our brother.

JDG 9:4  And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house
 of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which
 followed him.

JDG 9:5  And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren
 the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone:
 notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid
 himself.

JDG 9:6  And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of
 Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was
 in Shechem.

JDG 9:7  And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount
 Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto
 me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.

JDG 9:8  The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they
 said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

JDG 9:9  But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
 wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the
 trees?

JDG 9:10  And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.

JDG 9:11  But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and
 my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?

JDG 9:12  Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.

JDG 9:13  And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth
 God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

JDG 9:14  Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over
 us.

JDG 9:15  And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king
 over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire
 come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.

JDG 9:16  Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have
 made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his
 house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;

JDG 9:17  (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and
 delivered you out of the hand of Midian:

JDG 9:18  And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have
 slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made
 Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because
 he is your brother;)

JDG 9:19  If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his
 house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in
 you:

JDG 9:20  But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of
 Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of
 Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.

JDG 9:21  And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for
 fear of Abimelech his brother.

JDG 9:22  When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,

JDG 9:23  Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of
 Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:

JDG 9:24  That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal
 might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew
 them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his
 brethren.

JDG 9:25  And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the
 mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was
 told Abimelech.

JDG 9:26  And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to
 Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.

JDG 9:27  And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and
 trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and
 did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.

JDG 9:28  And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem,
 that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his
 officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we
 serve him?

JDG 9:29  And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove
 Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.

JDG 9:30  And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son
 of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

JDG 9:31  And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal
 the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they
 fortify the city against thee.

JDG 9:32  Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and
 lie in wait in the field:

JDG 9:33  And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou
 shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people
 that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou
 shalt find occasion.

JDG 9:34  And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by
 night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.

JDG 9:35  And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the
 gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him,
 from lying in wait.

JDG 9:36  And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come
 people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou
 seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.

JDG 9:37  And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the
 middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.

JDG 9:38  Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou
 saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people
 that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.

JDG 9:39  And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
 Abimelech.

JDG 9:40  And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were
 overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.

JDG 9:41  And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his
 brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

JDG 9:42  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the
 field; and they told Abimelech.

JDG 9:43  And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and
 laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth
 out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.

JDG 9:44  And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and
 stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies
 ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.

JDG 9:45  And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the
 city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed
 it with salt.

JDG 9:46  And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered
 into an hold of the house of the god Berith.

JDG 9:47  And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem
 were gathered together.

JDG 9:48  And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that
 were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough
 from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the
 people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I
 have done.

JDG 9:49  And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
 followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon
 them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand
 men and women.

JDG 9:50  Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took
 it.

JDG 9:51  But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all
 the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat
 them up to the top of the tower.

JDG 9:52  And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went
 hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

JDG 9:53  And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's
 head, and all to brake his skull.

JDG 9:54  Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said
 unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew
 him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.

JDG 9:55  And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed
 every man unto his place.

JDG 9:56  Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his
 father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

JDG 9:57  And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their
 heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

JDG 10:1  And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of
 Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount
 Ephraim.

JDG 10:2  And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried
 in Shamir.

JDG 10:3  And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and
 two years.

JDG 10:4  And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had
 thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the
 land of Gilead.

JDG 10:5  And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

JDG 10:6  And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
 LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods
 of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and
 the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.

JDG 10:7  And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them
 into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of
 Ammon.

JDG 10:8  And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
 eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan
 in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.

JDG 10:9  Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also
 against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so
 that Israel was sore distressed.

JDG 10:10  And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have
 sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served
 Baalim.

JDG 10:11  And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you
 from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and
 from the Philistines?

JDG 10:12  The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did
 oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.

JDG 10:13  Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will
 deliver you no more.

JDG 10:14  Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you
 in the time of your tribulation.

JDG 10:15  And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do
 thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray
 thee, this day.

JDG 10:16  And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the
 LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

JDG 10:17  Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in
 Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and
 encamped in Mizpeh.

JDG 10:18  And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man
 is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be
 head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

JDG 11:1  Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the
 son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.

JDG 11:2  And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and
 they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our
 father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.

JDG 11:3  Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob:
 and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.

JDG 11:4  And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon
 made war against Israel.

JDG 11:5  And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against
 Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:

JDG 11:6  And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may
 fight with the children of Ammon.

JDG 11:7  And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and
 expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye
 are in distress?

JDG 11:8  And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again
 to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of
 Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

JDG 11:9  And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home
 again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them
 before me, shall I be your head?

JDG 11:10  And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness
 between us, if we do not so according to thy words.

JDG 11:11  Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made
 him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the
 LORD in Mizpeh.

JDG 11:12  And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon,
 saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight
 in my land?

JDG 11:13  And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers
 of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of
 Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore
 those lands again peaceably.

JDG 11:14  And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of
 Ammon:

JDG 11:15  And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the
 land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:

JDG 11:16  But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
 wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;

JDG 11:17  Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I
 pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken
 thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not
 consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.

JDG 11:18  Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land
 of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of
 Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border
 of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.

JDG 11:19  And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king
 of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy
 land into my place.

JDG 11:20  But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon
 gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against
 Israel.

JDG 11:21  And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into
 the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land
 of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.

JDG 11:22  And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even
 unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

JDG 11:23  So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from
 before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?

JDG 11:24  Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to
 possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them
 will we possess.

JDG 11:25  And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king
 of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against
 them,

JDG 11:26  While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her
 towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three
 hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?

JDG 11:27  Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to
 war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of
 Israel and the children of Ammon.

JDG 11:28  Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the
 words of Jephthah which he sent him.

JDG 11:29  Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over
 Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of
 Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.

JDG 11:30  And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt
 without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,

JDG 11:31  Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my
 house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall
 surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.

JDG 11:32  So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against
 them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.

JDG 11:33  And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even
 twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great
 slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of
 Israel.

JDG 11:34  And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
 daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his
 only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.

JDG 11:35  And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and
 said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one
 of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I
 cannot go back.

JDG 11:36  And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto
 the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth;
 forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even
 of the children of Ammon.

JDG 11:37  And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me
 alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my
 virginity, I and my fellows.

JDG 11:38  And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went
 with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.

JDG 11:39  And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto
 her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she
 knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,

JDG 11:40  That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of
 Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

JDG 12:1  And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
 northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight
 against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will
 burn thine house upon thee with fire.

JDG 12:2  And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife
 with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out
 of their hands.

JDG 12:3  And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands,
 and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them
 into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight
 against me?

JDG 12:4  Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought
 with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye
 Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the
 Manassites.

JDG 12:5  And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
 Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped
 said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an
 Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

JDG 12:6  Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth:
 for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew
 him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites
 forty and two thousand.

JDG 12:7  And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
 Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.

JDG 12:8  And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

JDG 12:9  And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
 abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged
 Israel seven years.

JDG 12:10  Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

JDG 12:11  And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
 Israel ten years.

JDG 12:12  And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
 country of Zebulun.

JDG 12:13  And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.

JDG 12:14  And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore
 and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.

JDG 12:15  And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in
 Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.

JDG 13:1  And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD;
 and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.

JDG 13:2  And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites,
 whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.

JDG 13:3  And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her,
 Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and
 bear a son.

JDG 13:4  Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong
 drink, and eat not any unclean thing:

JDG 13:5  For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come
 on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he
 shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.

JDG 13:6  Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came
 unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God,
 very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his
 name:

JDG 13:7  But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and
 now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the
 child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.

JDG 13:8  Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of
 God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do
 unto the child that shall be born.

JDG 13:9  And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came
 again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not
 with her.

JDG 13:10  And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said
 unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other
 day.

JDG 13:11  And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and
 said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I
 am.

JDG 13:12  And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order
 the child, and how shall we do unto him?

JDG 13:13  And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto
 the woman let her beware.

JDG 13:14  She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let
 her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I
 commanded her let her observe.

JDG 13:15  And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us
 detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

JDG 13:16  And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I
 will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must
 offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.

JDG 13:17  And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that
 when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

JDG 13:18  And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after
 my name, seeing it is secret?

JDG 13:19  So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a
 rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife
 looked on.

JDG 13:20  For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off
 the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And
 Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.

JDG 13:21  But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his
 wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

JDG 13:22  And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have
 seen God.

JDG 13:23  But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he
 would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands,
 neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time
 have told us such things as these.

JDG 13:24  And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child
 grew, and the LORD blessed him.

JDG 13:25  And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of
 Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

JDG 14:1  And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the
 daughters of the Philistines.

JDG 14:2  And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have
 seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore
 get her for me to wife.

JDG 14:3  Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman
 among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest
 to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his
 father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.

JDG 14:4  But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that
 he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the
 Philistines had dominion over Israel.

JDG 14:5  Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and
 came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against
 him.

JDG 14:6  And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as
 he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his
 father or his mother what he had done.

JDG 14:7  And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson
 well.

JDG 14:8  And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see
 the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey
 in the carcase of the lion.

JDG 14:9  And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his
 father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them
 that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.

JDG 14:10  So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a
 feast; for so used the young men to do.

JDG 14:11  And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
 companions to be with him.

JDG 14:12  And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you:
 if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and
 find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of
 garments:

JDG 14:13  But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets
 and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle,
 that we may hear it.

JDG 14:14  And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out
 of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound
 the riddle.

JDG 14:15  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's
 wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we
 burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we
 have? is it not so?

JDG 14:16  And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate
 me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my
 people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not
 told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?

JDG 14:17  And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted:
 and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay
 sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.

JDG 14:18  And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the
 sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?
 and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found
 out my riddle.

JDG 14:19  And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
 Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change
 of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was
 kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

JDG 14:20  But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as
 his friend.

JDG 15:1  But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
 harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in
 to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.

JDG 15:2  And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated
 her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer
 than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.

JDG 15:3  And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than
 the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

JDG 15:4  And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,
 and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.

JDG 15:5  And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
 standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the
 standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.

JDG 15:6  Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered,
 Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and
 given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and
 her father with fire.

JDG 15:7  And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be
 avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

JDG 15:8  And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went
 down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

JDG 15:9  Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
 themselves in Lehi.

JDG 15:10  And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they
 answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.

JDG 15:11  Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
 Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers
 over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As
 they did unto me, so have I done unto them.

JDG 15:12  And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may
 deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them,
 Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.

JDG 15:13  And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and
 deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they
 bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.

JDG 15:14  And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and
 the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon
 his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from
 off his hands.

JDG 15:15  And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and
 took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.

JDG 15:16  And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with
 the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

JDG 15:17  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he
 cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.

JDG 15:18  And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast
 given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I
 die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?

JDG 15:19  But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came
 water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived:
 wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this
 day.

JDG 15:20  And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

JDG 16:1  Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto
 her.

JDG 16:2  And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they
 compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the
 city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day,
 we shall kill him.

JDG 16:3  And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the
 doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them,
 bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top
 of an hill that is before Hebron.

JDG 16:4  And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of
 Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

JDG 16:5  And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her,
 Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we
 may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will
 give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

JDG 16:6  And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great
 strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.

JDG 16:7  And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that
 were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

JDG 16:8  Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs
 which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.

JDG 16:9  Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.
 And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the
 withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his
 strength was not known.

JDG 16:10  And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told
 me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.

JDG 16:11  And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never
 were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

JDG 16:12  Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said
 unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait
 abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.

JDG 16:13  And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told
 me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If
 thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.

JDG 16:14  And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines
 be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the
 pin of the beam, and with the web.

JDG 16:15  And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine
 heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not
 told me wherein thy great strength lieth.

JDG 16:16  And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and
 urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;

JDG 16:17  That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not
 come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my
 mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall
 become weak, and be like any other man.

JDG 16:18  And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent
 and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for
 he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up
 unto her, and brought money in their hand.

JDG 16:19  And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and
 she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to
 afflict him, and his strength went from him.

JDG 16:20  And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out
 of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake
 myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.

JDG 16:21  But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him
 down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the
 prison house.

JDG 16:22  Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
 shaven.

JDG 16:23  Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to
 offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said,
 Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.

JDG 16:24  And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said,
 Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our
 country, which slew many of us.

JDG 16:25  And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said,
 Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out
 of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the
 pillars.

JDG 16:26  And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me
 that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean
 upon them.

JDG 16:27  Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the
 Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men
 and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.

JDG 16:28  And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me,
 I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I
 may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

JDG 16:29  And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house
 stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and
 of the other with his left.

JDG 16:30  And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
 himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all
 the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were
 more than they which he slew in his life.

JDG 16:31  Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and
 took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the
 buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.

JDG 17:1  And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

JDG 17:2  And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver
 that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in
 mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said,
 Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.

JDG 17:3  And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his
 mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from
 my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore
 I will restore it unto thee.

JDG 17:4  Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two
 hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a
 graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.

JDG 17:5  And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
 teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

JDG 17:6  In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that
 which was right in his own eyes.

JDG 17:7  And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of
 Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

JDG 17:8  And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn
 where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of
 Micah, as he journeyed.

JDG 17:9  And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I
 am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.

JDG 17:10  And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and
 a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit
 of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.

JDG 17:11  And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man
 was unto him as one of his sons.

JDG 17:12  And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
 priest, and was in the house of Micah.

JDG 17:13  Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I
 have a Levite to my priest.

JDG 18:1  In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the
 tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that
 day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of
 Israel.

JDG 18:2  And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their
 coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and
 to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they
 came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.

JDG 18:3  When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the
 young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who
 brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou
 here?

JDG 18:4  And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath
 hired me, and I am his priest.

JDG 18:5  And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we
 may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.

JDG 18:6  And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your
 way wherein ye go.

JDG 18:7  Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people
 that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the
 Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that
 might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians,
 and had no business with any man.

JDG 18:8  And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their
 brethren said unto them, What say ye?

JDG 18:9  And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have
 seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not
 slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.

JDG 18:10  When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land:
 for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any
 thing that is in the earth.

JDG 18:11  And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of
 Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.

JDG 18:12  And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore
 they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind
 Kirjathjearim.

JDG 18:13  And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house
 of Micah.

JDG 18:14  Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
 Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses
 an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore
 consider what ye have to do.

JDG 18:15  And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man
 the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.

JDG 18:16  And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which
 were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.

JDG 18:17  And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in
 thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the
 molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six
 hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.

JDG 18:18  And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the
 ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto
 them, What do ye?

JDG 18:19  And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy
 mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for
 thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto
 a tribe and a family in Israel?

JDG 18:20  And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the
 teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.

JDG 18:21  So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle
 and the carriage before them.

JDG 18:22  And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that
 were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook
 the children of Dan.

JDG 18:23  And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
 faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a
 company?

JDG 18:24  And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the
 priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye
 say unto me, What aileth thee?

JDG 18:25  And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard
 among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the
 lives of thy household.

JDG 18:26  And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they
 were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.

JDG 18:27  And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which
 he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and
 they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.

JDG 18:28  And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they
 had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by
 Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.

JDG 18:29  And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan
 their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was
 Laish at the first.

JDG 18:30  And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the
 son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the
 tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.

JDG 18:31  And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the
 time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

JDG 19:1  And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel,
 that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who
 took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.

JDG 19:2  And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from
 him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole
 months.

JDG 19:3  And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto
 her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of
 asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father
 of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.

JDG 19:4  And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he
 abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.

JDG 19:5  And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the
 morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son
 in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your
 way.

JDG 19:6  And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for
 the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry
 all night, and let thine heart be merry.

JDG 19:7  And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him:
 therefore he lodged there again.

JDG 19:8  And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the
 damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried
 until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.

JDG 19:9  And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his
 servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now
 the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day
 groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow
 get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.

JDG 19:10  But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
 departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were
 with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.

JDG 19:11  And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant
 said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city
 of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

JDG 19:12  And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the
 city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over
 to Gibeah.

JDG 19:13  And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one
 of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.

JDG 19:14  And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon
 them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.

JDG 19:15  And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and
 when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no
 man that took them into his house to lodging.

JDG 19:16  And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at
 even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the
 men of the place were Benjamites.

JDG 19:17  And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the
 street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence
 comest thou?

JDG 19:18  And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the
 side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I
 am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me
 to house.

JDG 19:19  Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is
 bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which
 is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.

JDG 19:20  And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy
 wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

JDG 19:21  So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses:
 and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

JDG 19:22  Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the
 city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the
 door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth
 the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.

JDG 19:23  And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said
 unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that
 this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.

JDG 19:24  Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will
 bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto
 you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.

JDG 19:25  But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
 concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her
 all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let
 her go.

JDG 19:26  Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the
 door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.

JDG 19:27  And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the
 house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was
 fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.

JDG 19:28  And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered.
 Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto
 his place.

JDG 19:29  And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold
 on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve
 pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.

JDG 19:30  And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed
 done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the
 land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your
 minds.

JDG 20:1  Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was
 gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of
 Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

JDG 20:2  And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel,
 presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred
 thousand footmen that drew sword.

JDG 20:3  (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were
 gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this
 wickedness?

JDG 20:4  And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and
 said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to
 lodge.

JDG 20:5  And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round
 about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have
 they forced, that she is dead.

JDG 20:6  And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
 throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have
 committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

JDG 20:7  Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and
 counsel.

JDG 20:8  And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go
 to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.

JDG 20:9  But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will
 go up by lot against it;

JDG 20:10  And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of
 Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to
 fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of
 Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

JDG 20:11  So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
 together as one man.

JDG 20:12  And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin,
 saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?

JDG 20:13  Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are
 in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But
 the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the
 children of Israel.

JDG 20:14  But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the
 cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.

JDG 20:15  And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the
 cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of
 Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.

JDG 20:16  Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
 lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.

JDG 20:17  And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred
 thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.

JDG 20:18  And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
 God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the
 battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up
 first.

JDG 20:19  And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped
 against Gibeah.

JDG 20:20  And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the
 men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.

JDG 20:21  And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed
 down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.

JDG 20:22  And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set
 their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array
 the first day.

JDG 20:23  (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until
 even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle
 against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against
 him.)

JDG 20:24  And the children of Israel came near against the children of
 Benjamin the second day.

JDG 20:25  And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
 day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again
 eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

JDG 20:26  Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and
 came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and
 fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
 before the LORD.

JDG 20:27  And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the
 covenant of God was there in those days,

JDG 20:28  And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it
 in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the
 children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up;
 for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.

JDG 20:29  And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

JDG 20:30  And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin
 on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other
 times.

JDG 20:31  And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were
 drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as
 at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of
 God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.

JDG 20:32  And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us,
 as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them
 from the city unto the highways.

JDG 20:33  And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
 themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth
 out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.

JDG 20:34  And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all
 Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.

JDG 20:35  And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
 Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an
 hundred men: all these drew the sword.

JDG 20:36  So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men
 of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers
 in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.

JDG 20:37  And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers
 in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the
 sword.

JDG 20:38  Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the
 liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out
 of the city.

JDG 20:39  And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to
 smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said,
 Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.

JDG 20:40  But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar
 of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the
 city ascended up to heaven.

JDG 20:41  And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were
 amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.

JDG 20:42  Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the
 way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out
 of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.

JDG 20:43  Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and
 trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.

JDG 20:44  And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men
 of valour.

JDG 20:45  And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of
 Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and
 pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.

JDG 20:46  So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five
 thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.

JDG 20:47  But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock
 Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

JDG 20:48  And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
 Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every
 city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the
 cities that they came to.

JDG 21:1  Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not
 any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

JDG 21:2  And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even
 before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;

JDG 21:3  And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel,
 that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?

JDG 21:4  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and
 built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.

JDG 21:5  And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of
 Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had
 made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh,
 saying, He shall surely be put to death.

JDG 21:6  And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
 brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.

JDG 21:7  How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn
 by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?

JDG 21:8  And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came
 not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from
 Jabeshgilead to the assembly.

JDG 21:9  For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the
 inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.

JDG 21:10  And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
 valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of
 Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.

JDG 21:11  And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy
 every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

JDG 21:12  And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred
 young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought
 them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.

JDG 21:13  And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of
 Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.

JDG 21:14  And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which
 they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed
 them not.

JDG 21:15  And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had
 made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

JDG 21:16  Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives
 for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?

JDG 21:17  And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped
 of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.

JDG 21:18  Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
 children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to
 Benjamin.

JDG 21:19  Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
 yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side
 of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of
 Lebonah.

JDG 21:20  Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and
 lie in wait in the vineyards;

JDG 21:21  And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance
 in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his
 wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.

JDG 21:22  And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us
 to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our
 sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did
 not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.

JDG 21:23  And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according
 to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and
 returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.

JDG 21:24  And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man
 to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to
 his inheritance.

JDG 21:25  In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which
 was right in his own eyes.

JOS 1:1  Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass,
 that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,

JOS 1:2  Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
 thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the
 children of Israel.

JOS 1:3  Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I
 given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

JOS 1:4  From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the
 river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward
 the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.

JOS 1:5  There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of
 thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee,
 nor forsake thee.

JOS 1:6  Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou
 divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give
 them.

JOS 1:7  Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to
 do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not
 from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper
 withersoever thou goest.

JOS 1:8  This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt
 meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to
 all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and
 then thou shalt have good success.

JOS 1:9  Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not
 afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee
 whithersoever thou goest.

JOS 1:10  Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

JOS 1:11  Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you
 victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to
 possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.

JOS 1:12  And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of
 Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

JOS 1:13  Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you,
 saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.

JOS 1:14  Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the
 land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your
 brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;

JOS 1:15  Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given
 you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth
 them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it,
 which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the
 sunrising.

JOS 1:16  And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will
 do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

JOS 1:17  According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
 hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.

JOS 1:18  Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not
 hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to
 death: only be strong and of a good courage.

JOS 2:1  And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly,
 saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an
 harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.

JOS 2:2  And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in
 hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.

JOS 2:3  And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men
 that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come
 to search out all the country.

JOS 2:4  And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There
 came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:

JOS 2:5  And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it
 was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after
 them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.

JOS 2:6  But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them
 with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.

JOS 2:7  And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and
 as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.

JOS 2:8  And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;

JOS 2:9  And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the
 land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants
 of the land faint because of you.

JOS 2:10  For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for
 you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the
 Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly
 destroyed.

JOS 2:11  And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
 neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the
 LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.

JOS 2:12  Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have
 shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's
 house, and give me a true token:

JOS 2:13  And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my
 brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from
 death.

JOS 2:14  And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this
 our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we
 will deal kindly and truly with thee.

JOS 2:15  Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house
 was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

JOS 2:16  And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers
 meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be
 returned: and afterward may ye go your way.

JOS 2:17  And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath
 which thou hast made us swear.

JOS 2:18  Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of
 scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt
 bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's
 household, home unto thee.

JOS 2:19  And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy
 house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be
 guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be
 on our head, if any hand be upon him.

JOS 2:20  And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine
 oath which thou hast made us to swear.

JOS 2:21  And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them
 away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.

JOS 2:22  And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three
 days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them
 throughout all the way, but found them not.

JOS 2:23  So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed
 over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell
 them:

JOS 2:24  And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our
 hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint
 because of us.

JOS 3:1  And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
 Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged
 there before they passed over.

JOS 3:2  And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through
 the host;

JOS 3:3  And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the
 covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then
 ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.

JOS 3:4  Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand
 cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which
 ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.

JOS 3:5  And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow
 the LORD will do wonders among you.

JOS 3:6  And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the
 covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the
 covenant, and went before the people.

JOS 3:7  And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee
 in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so
 I will be with thee.

JOS 3:8  And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant,
 saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand
 still in Jordan.

JOS 3:9  And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the
 words of the LORD your God.

JOS 3:10  And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among
 you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the
 Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the
 Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

JOS 3:11  Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth
 over before you into Jordan.

JOS 3:12  Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of
 every tribe a man.

JOS 3:13  And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the
 priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest
 in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the
 waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.

JOS 3:14  And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to
 pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the
 people;

JOS 3:15  And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet
 of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for
 Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)

JOS 3:16  That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an
 heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came
 down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut
 off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.

JOS 3:17  And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood
 firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over
 on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.

JOS 4:1  And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over
 Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

JOS 4:2  Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,

JOS 4:3  And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of
 Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve
 stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging
 place, where ye shall lodge this night.

JOS 4:4  Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
 children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

JOS 4:5  And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your
 God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon
 his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of
 Israel:

JOS 4:6  That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their
 fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?

JOS 4:7  Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off
 before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the
 waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto
 the children of Israel for ever.

JOS 4:8  And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up
 twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua,
 according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried
 them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down
 there.

JOS 4:9  And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place
 where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and
 they are there unto this day.

JOS 4:10  For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,
 until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto
 the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people
 hasted and passed over.

JOS 4:11  And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that
 the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the
 people.

JOS 4:12  And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the
 tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses
 spake unto them:

JOS 4:13  About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD
 unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

JOS 4:14  On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and
 they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.

JOS 4:15  And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

JOS 4:16  Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they
 come up out of Jordan.

JOS 4:17  Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of
 Jordan.

JOS 4:18  And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
 covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles
 of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of
 Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did
 before.

JOS 4:19  And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first
 month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.

JOS 4:20  And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua
 pitch in Gilgal.

JOS 4:21  And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children
 shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?

JOS 4:22  Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this
 Jordan on dry land.

JOS 4:23  For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you,
 until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he
 dried up from before us, until we were gone over:

JOS 4:24  That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD,
 that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.

JOS 5:1  And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on
 the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were
 by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before
 the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted,
 neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.

JOS 5:2  At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and
 circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.

JOS 5:3  And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of
 Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

JOS 5:4  And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that
 came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the
 wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.

JOS 5:5  Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people
 that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of
 Egypt, them they had not circumcised.

JOS 5:6  For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till
 all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed,
 because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that
 he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that
 he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

JOS 5:7  And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua
 circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised
 them by the way.

JOS 5:8  And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people,
 that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.

JOS 5:9  And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
 reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called
 Gilgal unto this day.

JOS 5:10  And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover
 on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.

JOS 5:11  And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the
 passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.

JOS 5:12  And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old
 corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they
 did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

JOS 5:13  And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up
 his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his
 sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art
 thou for us, or for our adversaries?

JOS 5:14  And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now
 come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said
 unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?

JOS 5:15  And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe
 from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua
 did so.

JOS 6:1  Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel:
 none went out, and none came in.

JOS 6:2  And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand
 Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.

JOS 6:3  And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about
 the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

JOS 6:4  And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams'
 horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the
 priests shall blow with the trumpets.

JOS 6:5  And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the
 ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall
 shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and
 the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.

JOS 6:6  And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take
 up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of
 rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.

JOS 6:7  And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let
 him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.

JOS 6:8  And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the
 seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the
 LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD
 followed them.

JOS 6:9  And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets,
 and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with
 the trumpets.

JOS 6:10  And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor
 make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your
 mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.

JOS 6:11  So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and
 they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

JOS 6:12  And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark
 of the LORD.

JOS 6:13  And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the
 ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the
 armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the
 LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

JOS 6:14  And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into
 the camp: so they did six days.

JOS 6:15  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about
 the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven
 times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.

JOS 6:16  And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with
 the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you
 the city.

JOS 6:17  And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein,
 to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her
 in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.

JOS 6:18  And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye
 make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the
 camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

JOS 6:19  But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are
 consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.

JOS 6:20  So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it
 came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people
 shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people
 went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.

JOS 6:21  And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and
 woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.

JOS 6:22  But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country,
 Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she
 hath, as ye sware unto her.

JOS 6:23  And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and
 her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they
 brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.

JOS 6:24  And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the
 silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the
 treasury of the house of the LORD.

JOS 6:25  And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's
 household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this
 day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

JOS 6:26  And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man
 before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay
 the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set
 up the gates of it.

JOS 6:27  So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all
 the country.

JOS 7:1  But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing:
 for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe
 of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled
 against the children of Israel.

JOS 7:2  And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on
 the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country.
 And the men went up and viewed Ai.

JOS 7:3  And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people
 go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make
 not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.

JOS 7:4  So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and
 they fled before the men of Ai.

JOS 7:5  And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they
 chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the
 going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.

JOS 7:6  And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face
 before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of
 Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

JOS 7:7  And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought
 this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to
 destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side
 Jordan!

JOS 7:8  O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their
 enemies!

JOS 7:9  For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of
 it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what
 wilt thou do unto thy great name?

JOS 7:10  And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus
 upon thy face?

JOS 7:11  Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which
 I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have
 also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own
 stuff.

JOS 7:12  Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
 enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were
 accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed
 from among you.

JOS 7:13  Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to
 morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing
 in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies,
 until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.

JOS 7:14  In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
 tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come
 according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take
 shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall
 come man by man.

JOS 7:15  And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall
 be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the
 covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.

JOS 7:16  So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their
 tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

JOS 7:17  And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the
 Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was
 taken:

JOS 7:18  And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
 Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.

JOS 7:19  And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the
 LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou
 hast done; hide it not from me.

JOS 7:20  And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the
 LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

JOS 7:21  When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two
 hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then
 I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the
 midst of my tent, and the silver under it.

JOS 7:22  So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold,
 it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

JOS 7:23  And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them
 unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before
 the LORD.

JOS 7:24  And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and
 the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his
 daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all
 that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.

JOS 7:25  And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble
 thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with
 fire, after they had stoned them with stones.

JOS 7:26  And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the
 LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that
 place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.

JOS 8:1  And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:
 take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have
 given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his
 land:

JOS 8:2  And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and
 her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a
 prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.

JOS 8:3  So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and
 Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by
 night.

JOS 8:4  And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against
 the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all
 ready:

JOS 8:5  And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the
 city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the
 first, that we will flee before them,

JOS 8:6  (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the
 city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we
 will flee before them.

JOS 8:7  Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for
 the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

JOS 8:8  And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the
 city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I
 have commanded you.

JOS 8:9  Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and
 abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that
 night among the people.

JOS 8:10  And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and
 went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.

JOS 8:11  And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went
 up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of
 Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.

JOS 8:12  And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush
 between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

JOS 8:13  And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the
 north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua
 went that night into the midst of the valley.

JOS 8:14  And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and
 rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he
 and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not
 that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.

JOS 8:15  And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
 them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

JOS 8:16  And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue
 after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.

JOS 8:17  And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after
 Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.

JOS 8:18  And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy
 hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out
 the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.

JOS 8:19  And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon
 as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took
 it, and hasted and set the city on fire.

JOS 8:20  And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the
 smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this
 way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon
 the pursuers.

JOS 8:21  And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the
 city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and
 slew the men of Ai.

JOS 8:22  And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were
 in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they
 smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.

JOS 8:23  And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

JOS 8:24  And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the
 inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased
 them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were
 consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the
 edge of the sword.

JOS 8:25  And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women,
 were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

JOS 8:26  For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the
 spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

JOS 8:27  Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey
 unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded
 Joshua.

JOS 8:28  And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation
 unto this day.

JOS 8:29  And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as
 the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down
 from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise
 thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.

JOS 8:30  Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,

JOS 8:31  As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as
 it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over
 which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings
 unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.

JOS 8:32  And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which
 he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

JOS 8:33  And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,
 stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites,
 which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he
 that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half
 of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had
 commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

JOS 8:34  And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and
 cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.

JOS 8:35  There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read
 not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little
 ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

JOS 9:1  And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side
 Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great
 sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the
 Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;

JOS 9:2  That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with
 Israel, with one accord.

JOS 9:3  And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto
 Jericho and to Ai,

JOS 9:4  They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
 ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and
 rent, and bound up;

JOS 9:5  And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them;
 and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.

JOS 9:6  And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
 him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore
 make ye a league with us.

JOS 9:7  And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell
 among us; and how shall we make a league with you?

JOS 9:8  And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto
 them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?

JOS 9:9  And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come
 because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of
 him, and all that he did in Egypt,

JOS 9:10  And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were
 beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was
 at Ashtaroth.

JOS 9:11  Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to
 us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and
 say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.

JOS 9:12  This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the
 day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is
 mouldy:

JOS 9:13  And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and,
 behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by
 reason of the very long journey.

JOS 9:14  And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the
 mouth of the LORD.

JOS 9:15  And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let
 them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.

JOS 9:16  And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a
 league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that
 they dwelt among them.

JOS 9:17  And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on
 the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and
 Kirjathjearim.

JOS 9:18  And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the
 congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the
 congregation murmured against the princes.

JOS 9:19  But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn
 unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.

JOS 9:20  This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be
 upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.

JOS 9:21  And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers
 of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had
 promised them.

JOS 9:22  And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore
 have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among
 us?

JOS 9:23  Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed
 from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of
 my God.

JOS 9:24  And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy
 servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you
 all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before
 you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done
 this thing.

JOS 9:25  And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right
 unto thee to do unto us, do.

JOS 9:26  And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the
 children of Israel, that they slew them not.

JOS 9:27  And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for
 the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the
 place which he should choose.

JOS 10:1  Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how
 Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho
 and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of
 Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;

JOS 10:2  That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one
 of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men
 thereof were mighty.

JOS 10:3  Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of
 Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and
 unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

JOS 10:4  Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath
 made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

JOS 10:5  Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the
 king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon,
 gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and
 encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.

JOS 10:6  And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying,
 Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and
 help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are
 gathered together against us.

JOS 10:7  So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with
 him, and all the mighty men of valour.

JOS 10:8  And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered
 them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.

JOS 10:9  Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all
 night.

JOS 10:10  And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a
 great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to
 Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.

JOS 10:11  And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
 in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from
 heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with
 hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.

JOS 10:12  Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up
 the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of
 Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of
 Ajalon.

JOS 10:13  And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had
 avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of
 Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go
 down about a whole day.

JOS 10:14  And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD
 hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.

JOS 10:15  And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
 Gilgal.

JOS 10:16  But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.

JOS 10:17  And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a
 cave at Makkedah.

JOS 10:18  And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and
 set men by it for to keep them:

JOS 10:19  And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the
 hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD
 your God hath delivered them into your hand.

JOS 10:20  And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made
 an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed,
 that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.

JOS 10:21  And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in
 peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.

JOS 10:22  Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those
 five kings unto me out of the cave.

JOS 10:23  And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out
 of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of
 Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

JOS 10:24  And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua,
 that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains
 of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the
 necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks
 of them.

JOS 10:25  And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and
 of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom
 ye fight.

JOS 10:26  And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on
 five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.

JOS 10:27  And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that
 Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into
 the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's
 mouth, which remain until this very day.

JOS 10:28  And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the
 sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls
 that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as
 he did unto the king of Jericho.

JOS 10:29  Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto
 Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

JOS 10:30  And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand
 of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that
 were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he
 did unto the king of Jericho.

JOS 10:31  And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
 Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:

JOS 10:32  And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took
 it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the
 souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.

JOS 10:33  Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote
 him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.

JOS 10:34  And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him;
 and they encamped against it, and fought against it:

JOS 10:35  And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the
 sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day,
 according to all that he had done to Lachish.

JOS 10:36  And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron;
 and they fought against it:

JOS 10:37  And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the
 king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were
 therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon;
 but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.

JOS 10:38  And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought
 against it:

JOS 10:39  And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof;
 and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the
 souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so
 he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and
 to her king.

JOS 10:40  So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and
 of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining,
 but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.

JOS 10:41  And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the
 country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

JOS 10:42  And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
 because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

JOS 10:43  And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
 Gilgal.

JOS 11:1  And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things,
 that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the
 king of Achshaph,

JOS 11:2  And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the
 plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on
 the west,

JOS 11:3  And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the
 Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the
 mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

JOS 11:4  And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people,
 even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and
 chariots very many.

JOS 11:5  And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched
 together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.

JOS 11:6  And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to
 morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou
 shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.

JOS 11:7  So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by
 the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

JOS 11:8  And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
 them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the
 valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none
 remaining.

JOS 11:9  And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their
 horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

JOS 11:10  And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the
 king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those
 kingdoms.

JOS 11:11  And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the
 sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he
 burnt Hazor with fire.

JOS 11:12  And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did
 Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly
 destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.

JOS 11:13  But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel
 burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.

JOS 11:14  And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of
 Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the
 edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to
 breathe.

JOS 11:15  As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
 Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD
 commanded Moses.

JOS 11:16  So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
 country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the
 mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

JOS 11:17  Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad
 in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and
 smote them, and slew them.

JOS 11:18  Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

JOS 11:19  There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel,
 save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.

JOS 11:20  For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come
 against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they
 might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded
 Moses.

JOS 11:21  And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
 mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of
 Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly
 with their cities.

JOS 11:22  There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of
 Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.

JOS 11:23  So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said
 unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according
 to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

JOS 12:1  Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel
 smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising
 of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the
 east:

JOS 12:2  Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from
 Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the
 river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border
 of the children of Ammon;

JOS 12:3  And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the
 sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth;
 and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:

JOS 12:4  And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the
 giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

JOS 12:5  And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto
 the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the
 border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

JOS 12:6  Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel
 smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the
 Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

JOS 12:7  And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children
 of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley
 of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua
 gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

JOS 12:8  In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the
 springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the
 Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

JOS 12:9  The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel,
 one;

JOS 12:10  The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

JOS 12:11  The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

JOS 12:12  The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

JOS 12:13  The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

JOS 12:14  The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

JOS 12:15  The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

JOS 12:16  The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

JOS 12:17  The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

JOS 12:18  The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

JOS 12:19  The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

JOS 12:20  The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

JOS 12:21  The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

JOS 12:22  The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;

JOS 12:23  The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of
 Gilgal, one;

JOS 12:24  The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.

JOS 13:1  Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him,
 Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to
 be possessed.

JOS 13:2  This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
 Philistines, and all Geshuri,

JOS 13:3  From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron
 northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines;
 the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the
 Ekronites; also the Avites:

JOS 13:4  From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is
 beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:

JOS 13:5  And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising,
 from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.

JOS 13:6  All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
 Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the
 children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an
 inheritance, as I have commanded thee.

JOS 13:7  Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine
 tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

JOS 13:8  With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
 inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the
 servant of the LORD gave them;

JOS 13:9  From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city
 that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;

JOS 13:10  And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in
 Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

JOS 13:11  And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and
 all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;

JOS 13:12  All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in
 Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses
 smite, and cast them out.

JOS 13:13  Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor
 the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the
 Israelites until this day.

JOS 13:14  Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
 sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as
 he said unto them.

JOS 13:15  And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance
 according to their families.

JOS 13:16  And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river
 Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by
 Medeba;

JOS 13:17  Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and
 Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,

JOS 13:18  And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

JOS 13:19  And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the
 valley,

JOS 13:20  And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,

JOS 13:21  And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king
 of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes
 of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of
 Sihon, dwelling in the country.

JOS 13:22  Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of
 Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.

JOS 13:23  And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border
 thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their
 families, the cities and the villages thereof.

JOS 13:24  And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the
 children of Gad according to their families.

JOS 13:25  And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half
 the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;

JOS 13:26  And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim
 unto the border of Debir;

JOS 13:27  And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and
 Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his
 border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan
 eastward.

JOS 13:28  This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
 families, the cities, and their villages.

JOS 13:29  And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this
 was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their
 families.

JOS 13:30  And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og
 king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore
 cities:

JOS 13:31  And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of
 Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of
 Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.

JOS 13:32  These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance
 in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.

JOS 13:33  But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD
 God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.

JOS 14:1  And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited
 in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of
 Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel,
 distributed for inheritance to them.

JOS 14:2  By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of
 Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

JOS 14:3  For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe
 on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among
 them.

JOS 14:4  For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
 therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to
 dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.

JOS 14:5  As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they
 divided the land.

JOS 14:6  Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the
 son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the
 LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.

JOS 14:7  Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from
 Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in
 mine heart.

JOS 14:8  Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the
 people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

JOS 14:9  And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet
 have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because
 thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.

JOS 14:10  And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these
 forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while
 the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day
 fourscore and five years old.

JOS 14:11  As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent
 me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go
 out, and to come in.

JOS 14:12  Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that
 day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the
 cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall
 be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.

JOS 14:13  And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh
 Hebron for an inheritance.

JOS 14:14  Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
 Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the
 LORD God of Israel.

JOS 14:15  And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a
 great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

JOS 15:1  This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their
 families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the
 uttermost part of the south coast.

JOS 15:2  And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the
 bay that looketh southward:

JOS 15:3  And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along
 to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along
 to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

JOS 15:4  From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of
 Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your
 south coast.

JOS 15:5  And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan.
 And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the
 uttermost part of Jordan:

JOS 15:6  And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of
 Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:

JOS 15:7  And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so
 northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim,
 which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the
 waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:

JOS 15:8  And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the
 south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up
 to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward,
 which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:

JOS 15:9  And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain
 of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the
 border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:

JOS 15:10  And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and
 passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north
 side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:

JOS 15:11  And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the
 border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out
 unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.

JOS 15:12  And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.
 This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their
 families.

JOS 15:13  And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
 children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even
 the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.

JOS 15:14  And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
 Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

JOS 15:15  And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of
 Debir before was Kirjathsepher.

JOS 15:16  And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him
 will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

JOS 15:17  And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he
 gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

JOS 15:18  And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask
 of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her,
 What wouldest thou?

JOS 15:19  Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south
 land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and
 the nether springs.

JOS 15:20  This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
 according to their families.

JOS 15:21  And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
 toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,

JOS 15:22  And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

JOS 15:23  And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

JOS 15:24  Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

JOS 15:25  And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

JOS 15:26  Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

JOS 15:27  And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,

JOS 15:28  And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,

JOS 15:29  Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,

JOS 15:30  And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

JOS 15:31  And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,

JOS 15:32  And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are
 twenty and nine, with their villages:

JOS 15:33  And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

JOS 15:34  And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

JOS 15:35  Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

JOS 15:36  And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen
 cities with their villages:

JOS 15:37  Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,

JOS 15:38  And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,

JOS 15:39  Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

JOS 15:40  And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,

JOS 15:41  And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities
 with their villages:

JOS 15:42  Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

JOS 15:43  And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

JOS 15:44  And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their
 villages:

JOS 15:45  Ekron, with her towns and her villages:

JOS 15:46  From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their
 villages:

JOS 15:47  Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her
 villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof:

JOS 15:48  And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

JOS 15:49  And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,

JOS 15:50  And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

JOS 15:51  And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:

JOS 15:52  Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

JOS 15:53  And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,

JOS 15:54  And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine cities
 with their villages:

JOS 15:55  Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,

JOS 15:56  And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

JOS 15:57  Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:

JOS 15:58  Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,

JOS 15:59  And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their
 villages:

JOS 15:60  Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with
 their villages:

JOS 15:61  In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,

JOS 15:62  And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their
 villages.

JOS 15:63  As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of
 Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of
 Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

JOS 16:1  And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho,
 unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from
 Jericho throughout mount Bethel,

JOS 16:2  And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders
 of Archi to Ataroth,

JOS 16:3  And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of
 Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at the
 sea.

JOS 16:4  So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
 inheritance.

JOS 16:5  And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families
 was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was
 Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;

JOS 16:6  And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north
 side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it
 on the east to Janohah;

JOS 16:7  And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to
 Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

JOS 16:8  The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and
 the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe
 of the children of Ephraim by their families.

JOS 16:9  And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the
 inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.

JOS 16:10  And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the
 Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under
 tribute.

JOS 17:1  There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
 firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father
 of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

JOS 17:2  There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by
 their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of
 Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and
 for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the
 male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

JOS 17:3  But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
 Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the
 names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

JOS 17:4  And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the
 son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give
 us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment
 of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.

JOS 17:5  And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead
 and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;

JOS 17:6  Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons:
 and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

JOS 17:7  And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth
 before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the
 inhabitants of Entappuah.

JOS 17:8  Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of
 Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;

JOS 17:9  And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river:
 these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of
 Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it
 were at the sea:

JOS 17:10  Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the
 sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in
 Issachar on the east.

JOS 17:11  And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns,
 and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the
 inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her
 towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.

JOS 17:12  Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of
 those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

JOS 17:13  Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong,
 that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.

JOS 17:14  And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou
 given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people,
 forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?

JOS 17:15  And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee
 up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the
 Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.

JOS 17:16  And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and
 all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of
 iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the
 valley of Jezreel.

JOS 17:17  And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to
 Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt
 not have one lot only:

JOS 17:18  But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt
 cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out
 the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.

JOS 18:1  And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
 together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And
 the land was subdued before them.

JOS 18:2  And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which
 had not yet received their inheritance.

JOS 18:3  And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to
 go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?

JOS 18:4  Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send
 them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according
 to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.

JOS 18:5  And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their
 coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on
 the north.

JOS 18:6  Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the
 description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD
 our God.

JOS 18:7  But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the
 LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of
 Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which
 Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.

JOS 18:8  And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went
 to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe
 it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD
 in Shiloh.

JOS 18:9  And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by
 cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at
 Shiloh.

JOS 18:10  And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there
 Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their
 divisions.

JOS 18:11  And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
 according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between
 the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

JOS 18:12  And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border
 went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the
 mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of
 Bethaven.

JOS 18:13  And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz,
 which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the
 hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.

JOS 18:14  And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea
 southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward; and the
 goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the
 children of Judah: this was the west quarter.

JOS 18:15  And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the
 border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:

JOS 18:16  And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth
 before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the
 giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of
 Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,

JOS 18:17  And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went
 forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and
 descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,

JOS 18:18  And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and
 went down unto Arabah:

JOS 18:19  And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and
 the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the
 south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.

JOS 18:20  And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
 inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about,
 according to their families.

JOS 18:21  Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according
 to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,

JOS 18:22  And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

JOS 18:23  And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,

JOS 18:24  And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their
 villages:

JOS 18:25  Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

JOS 18:26  And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

JOS 18:27  And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

JOS 18:28  And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and
 Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the
 children of Benjamin according to their families.

JOS 19:1  And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the
 children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was
 within the inheritance of the children of Judah.

JOS 19:2  And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and Moladah,

JOS 19:3  And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

JOS 19:4  And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

JOS 19:5  And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

JOS 19:6  And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages:

JOS 19:7  Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages:

JOS 19:8  And all the villages that were round about these cities to
 Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the
 children of Simeon according to their families.

JOS 19:9  Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance
 of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much
 for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the
 inheritance of them.

JOS 19:10  And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according
 to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:

JOS 19:11  And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to
 Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam;

JOS 19:12  And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border
 of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia,

JOS 19:13  And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher, to
 Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;

JOS 19:14  And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and the
 outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:

JOS 19:15  And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem:
 twelve cities with their villages.

JOS 19:16  This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
 to their families, these cities with their villages.

JOS 19:17  And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
 Issachar according to their families.

JOS 19:18  And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,

JOS 19:19  And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath,

JOS 19:20  And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

JOS 19:21  And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

JOS 19:22  And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh;
 and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their
 villages.

JOS 19:23  This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar
 according to their families, the cities and their villages.

JOS 19:24  And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher
 according to their families.

JOS 19:25  And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,

JOS 19:26  And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
 westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

JOS 19:27  And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to
 Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of
 Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,

JOS 19:28  And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Zidon;

JOS 19:29  And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre;
 and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from
 the coast to Achzib:

JOS 19:30  Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their
 villages.

JOS 19:31  This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
 according to their families, these cities with their villages.

JOS 19:32  The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the
 children of Naphtali according to their families.

JOS 19:33  And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami,
 Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:

JOS 19:34  And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth out
 from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and
 reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the
 sunrising.

JOS 19:35  And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and
 Chinnereth,

JOS 19:36  And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

JOS 19:37  And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,

JOS 19:38  And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh;
 nineteen cities with their villages.

JOS 19:39  This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
 according to their families, the cities and their villages.

JOS 19:40  And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan
 according to their families.

JOS 19:41  And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
 Irshemesh,

JOS 19:42  And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

JOS 19:43  And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

JOS 19:44  And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

JOS 19:45  And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,

JOS 19:46  And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

JOS 19:47  And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them:
 therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took
 it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt
 therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.

JOS 19:48  This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
 according to their families, these cities with their villages.

JOS 19:49  When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by
 their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of
 Nun among them:

JOS 19:50  According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he
 asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt
 therein.

JOS 19:51  These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the
 son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of
 Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the
 door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing
 the country.

JOS 20:1  The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,

JOS 20:2  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities
 of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:

JOS 20:3  That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may
 flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.

JOS 20:4  And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at
 the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears
 of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and
 give him a place, that he may dwell among them.

JOS 20:5  And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not
 deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour
 unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

JOS 20:6  And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
 congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall
 be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own
 city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.

JOS 20:7  And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem
 in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.

JOS 20:8  And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer
 in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in
 Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of
 Manasseh.

JOS 20:9  These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and
 for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any
 person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger
 of blood, until he stood before the congregation.

JOS 21:1  Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar
 the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers
 of the tribes of the children of Israel;

JOS 21:2  And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The
 LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the
 suburbs thereof for our cattle.

JOS 21:3  And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
 inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.

JOS 21:4  And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the
 children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out
 of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe
 of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

JOS 21:5  And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families
 of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half
 tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

JOS 21:6  And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the
 tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of
 Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.

JOS 21:7  The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of
 Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve
 cities.

JOS 21:8  And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities
 with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

JOS 21:9  And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out
 of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned
 by name.

JOS 21:10  Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
 Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first
 lot.

JOS 21:11  And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city
 is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about
 it.

JOS 21:12  But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to
 Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

JOS 21:13  Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her
 suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,

JOS 21:14  And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,

JOS 21:15  And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,

JOS 21:16  And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
 Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.

JOS 21:17  And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with
 her suburbs,

JOS 21:18  Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.

JOS 21:19  All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen
 cities with their suburbs.

JOS 21:20  And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
 remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out
 of the tribe of Ephraim.

JOS 21:21  For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be
 a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs,

JOS 21:22  And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four
 cities.

JOS 21:23  And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon
 with her suburbs,

JOS 21:24  Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four cities.

JOS 21:25  And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and
 Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

JOS 21:26  All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the
 children of Kohath that remained.

JOS 21:27  And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites,
 out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her
 suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with her
 suburbs; two cities.

JOS 21:28  And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh
 with her suburbs,

JOS 21:29  Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four cities.

JOS 21:30  And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with
 her suburbs,

JOS 21:31  Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities.

JOS 21:32  And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
 suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her
 suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.

JOS 21:33  All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were
 thirteen cities with their suburbs.

JOS 21:34  And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the
 Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah
 with her suburbs,

JOS 21:35  Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.

JOS 21:36  And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah
 with her suburbs,

JOS 21:37  Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four
 cities.

JOS 21:38  And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, to
 be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,

JOS 21:39  Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in
 all.

JOS 21:40  So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families,
 which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve
 cities.

JOS 21:41  All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children
 of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.

JOS 21:42  These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:
 thus were all these cities.

JOS 21:43  And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give
 unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.

JOS 21:44  And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he
 sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies
 before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.

JOS 21:45  There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken
 unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

JOS 22:1  Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
 tribe of Manasseh,

JOS 22:2  And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the
 LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:

JOS 22:3  Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but
 have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.

JOS 22:4  And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he
 promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto
 the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on
 the other side Jordan.

JOS 22:5  But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses
 the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk
 in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to
 serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.

JOS 22:6  So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their
 tents.

JOS 22:7  Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
 possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their
 brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also
 unto their tents, then he blessed them,

JOS 22:8  And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your
 tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with
 brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your
 enemies with your brethren.

JOS 22:9  And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe
 of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh,
 which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land
 of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word
 of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

JOS 22:10  And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land
 of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe
 of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.

JOS 22:11  And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben
 and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar
 over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage
 of the children of Israel.

JOS 22:12  And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation
 of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to
 war against them.

JOS 22:13  And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and
 to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of
 Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,

JOS 22:14  And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout
 all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their
 fathers among the thousands of Israel.

JOS 22:15  And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of
 Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they
 spake with them, saying,

JOS 22:16  Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this
 that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from
 following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel
 this day against the LORD?

JOS 22:17  Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not
 cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation
 of the LORD,

JOS 22:18  But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it
 will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be
 wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.

JOS 22:19  Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then
 pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's
 tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the
 LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the
 LORD our God.

JOS 22:20  Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed
 thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man
 perished not alone in his iniquity.

JOS 22:21  Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
 tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of
 Israel,

JOS 22:22  The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel
 he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the
 LORD, (save us not this day,)

JOS 22:23  That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or
 if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace
 offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;

JOS 22:24  And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In
 time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have
 ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?

JOS 22:25  For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye
 children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall
 your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.

JOS 22:26  Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for
 burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

JOS 22:27  But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our
 generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him
 with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace
 offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye
 have no part in the LORD.

JOS 22:28  Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us
 or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the
 pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt
 offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.

JOS 22:29  God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day
 from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat
 offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is
 before his tabernacle.

JOS 22:30  And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation
 and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words
 that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of
 Manasseh spake, it pleased them.

JOS 22:31  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of
 Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day
 we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this
 trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out
 of the hand of the LORD.

JOS 22:32  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
 returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out
 of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of
 Israel, and brought them word again.

JOS 22:33  And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of
 Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to
 destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.

JOS 22:34  And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar
 Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.

JOS 23:1  And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest
 unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and
 stricken in age.

JOS 23:2  And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their
 heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am
 old and stricken in age:

JOS 23:3  And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these
 nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.

JOS 23:4  Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to
 be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I
 have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.

JOS 23:5  And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive
 them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD
 your God hath promised unto you.

JOS 23:6  Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written
 in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the
 right hand or to the left;

JOS 23:7  That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;
 neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them,
 neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:

JOS 23:8  But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.

JOS 23:9  For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
 strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this
 day.

JOS 23:10  One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it
 is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

JOS 23:11  Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your
 God.

JOS 23:12  Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
 of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages
 with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:

JOS 23:13  Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out
 any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto
 you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish
 from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.

JOS 23:14  And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye
 know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed
 of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are
 come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.

JOS 23:15  Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come
 upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon
 you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land
 which the LORD your God hath given you.

JOS 23:16  When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which
 he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves
 to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye
 shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.

JOS 24:1  And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called
 for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for
 their officers; and they presented themselves before God.

JOS 24:2  And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of
 Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even
 Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other
 gods.

JOS 24:3  And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and
 led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave
 him Isaac.

JOS 24:4  And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount
 Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.

JOS 24:5  I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that
 which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

JOS 24:6  And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea;
 and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto
 the Red sea.

JOS 24:7  And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and
 the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes
 have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long
 season.

JOS 24:8  And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the
 other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand,
 that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.

JOS 24:9  Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against
 Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:

JOS 24:10  But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still:
 so I delivered you out of his hand.

JOS 24:11  And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of
 Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
 Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the
 Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.

JOS 24:12  And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before
 you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy
 bow.

JOS 24:13  And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities
 which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards
 which ye planted not do ye eat.

JOS 24:14  Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
 truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side
 of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.

JOS 24:15  And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day
 whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on
 the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye
 dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

JOS 24:16  And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake
 the LORD, to serve other gods;

JOS 24:17  For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers
 out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those
 great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we
 went, and among all the people through whom we passed:

JOS 24:18  And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the
 Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for
 he is our God.

JOS 24:19  And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is
 an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor
 your sins.

JOS 24:20  If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn
 and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.

JOS 24:21  And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.

JOS 24:22  And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves
 that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are
 witnesses.

JOS 24:23  Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among
 you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.

JOS 24:24  And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and
 his voice will we obey.

JOS 24:25  So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a
 statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

JOS 24:26  And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took
 a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary
 of the LORD.

JOS 24:27  And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a
 witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake
 unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.

JOS 24:28  So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.

JOS 24:29  And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
 Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.

JOS 24:30  And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
 Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of
 Gaash.

JOS 24:31  And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days
 of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the
 LORD, that he had done for Israel.

JOS 24:32  And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out
 of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought
 of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver:
 and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.

JOS 24:33  And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill
 that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.

 Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the
 children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;

NUM 3:13  Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all
 the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in
 Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD.

NUM 3:14  And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,

 tabernacle northward.

NUM 3:36  And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the
 boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and
 the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth
 thereto,

NUM 3:37  And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and
 their pins, and their cords.

NUM 3:38  But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even

 of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number
 of their names.

NUM 3:41  And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of all
 the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites
 instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.

NUM 3:42  And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn
 among the children of Israel.

NUM 3:43  And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old
 and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand
 two hundred and threescore and thirteen.

NUM 3:44  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 3:45  Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of
 Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the
 Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.

NUM 3:46  And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
 threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are
 more than the Levites;

NUM 3:47  Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the
 shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:)

NUM 3:48  And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to
 be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

NUM 3:49  And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above

 it:

NUM 4:6  And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and shall spread

NUM 4:7  And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and
 put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover

NUM 4:13  And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a
 purple cloth thereon:

NUM 4:14  And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they
 minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the
 basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a
 covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it.

NUM 4:15  And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
 sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set
 forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall
 not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the
 sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.

NUM 4:16  And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth
 the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat
 offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and

NUM 4:17  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,

NUM 4:18  Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among
 the Levites:

NUM 4:19  But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they
 approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and
 appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:

NUM 4:20  But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered,
 lest they die.

NUM 4:21  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 4:22  Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses
 of their fathers, by their families;

NUM 4:23  From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou
 number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the
 tabernacle of the congregation.

NUM 4:24  This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and
 for burdens:

NUM 4:25  And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
 tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the
 badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation,

NUM 4:26  And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the

NUM 4:27  At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service
 of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their
 service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.

NUM 4:28  This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the
 tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the hand of
 Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

NUM 4:29  As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
 families, by the house of their fathers;

NUM 4:30  From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou
 number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the
 tabernacle of the congregation.

NUM 4:31  And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
 service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the
 tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets
 thereof,

NUM 4:32  And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and
 their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their
 service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their
 burden.

NUM 4:33  This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according
 to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the hand
 of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

NUM 4:34  And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the
 sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house of their
 fathers,

NUM 4:35  From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one
 that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the
 congregation:

NUM 4:36  And those that were numbered of them by their families were two
 thousand seven hundred and fifty.

NUM 4:37  These were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites,
 all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, which Moses
 and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of
 Moses.

NUM 4:38  And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout their
 families, and by the house of their fathers,

NUM 4:39  From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one
 that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the

NUM 4:41  These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of

NUM 4:42  And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari,

NUM 4:43  From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one
 that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the
 congregation,

NUM 4:44  Even those that were numbered of them after their families, were
 three thousand and two hundred.

NUM 4:45  These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
 Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the LORD by
 the hand of Moses.

NUM 4:46  All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and
 the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after the house
 of their fathers,

NUM 4:47  From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one
 that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden
 in the tabernacle of the congregation.

NUM 4:48  Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five
 hundred and fourscore,

NUM 4:49  According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by the
 hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his
 burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the LORD commanded Moses.

NUM 5:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 5:2  Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every
 leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the
 dead:

NUM 5:3  Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put
 them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.

NUM 5:4  And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp:
 as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.

NUM 5:5  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 5:6  Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit
 any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person
 be guilty;

NUM 5:7  Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall
 recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth
 part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.

NUM 5:8  But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let
 the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram
 of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.

NUM 5:9  And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel,
 which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

NUM 5:10  And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man
 giveth the priest, it shall be his.

NUM 5:11  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 5:12  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's
 wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,

NUM 5:13  And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her
 husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness
 against her, neither she be taken with the manner;

NUM 5:14  And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his
 wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he
 be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:

NUM 5:15  Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring
 her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall
 pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of
 jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

NUM 5:16  And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:

NUM 5:17  And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the
 dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it
 into the water:

NUM 5:18  And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the
 woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the
 jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water
 that causeth the curse:

NUM 5:19  And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman,
 If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness
 with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that
 causeth the curse:

NUM 5:20  But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if
 thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband:

NUM 5:21  Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and
 the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath
 among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to
 swell;

NUM 5:22  And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to
 make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen,
 amen.

NUM 5:23  And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot
 them out with the bitter water:

NUM 5:24  And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth
 the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and
 become bitter.

NUM 5:25  Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's
 hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the
 altar:

NUM 5:26  And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the
 memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the
 woman to drink the water.

NUM 5:27  And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to
 pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband,
 that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become
 bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman
 shall be a curse among her people.

NUM 5:28  And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be
 free, and shall conceive seed.

NUM 5:29  This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another
 instead of her husband, and is defiled;

NUM 5:30  Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous
 over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall
 execute upon her all this law.

NUM 5:31  Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall
 bear her iniquity.

NUM 6:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 6:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man
 or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate
 themselves unto the LORD:

NUM 6:3  He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink
 no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any
 liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.

NUM 6:4  All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made
 of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

NUM 6:5  All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come
 upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth
 himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair
 of his head grow.

NUM 6:6  All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall come at
 no dead body.

NUM 6:7  He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother,
 for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration
 of his God is upon his head.

NUM 6:8  All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.

NUM 6:9  And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head
 of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his
 cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.

NUM 6:10  And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
 pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

NUM 6:11  And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other
 for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by
 the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.

NUM 6:12  And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and
 shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days
 that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.

NUM 6:13  And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation
 are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation:

NUM 6:14  And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the
 first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the
 first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish
 for peace offerings,

NUM 6:15  And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with
 oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat
 offering, and their drink offerings.

NUM 6:16  And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his
 sin offering, and his burnt offering:

NUM 6:17  And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto
 the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also
 his meat offering, and his drink offering.

NUM 6:18  And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door
 of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of
 his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the
 peace offerings.

NUM 6:19  And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one
 unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put
 them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is
 shaven:

NUM 6:20  And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:
 this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and
 after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

NUM 6:21  This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering
 unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get:
 according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his
 separation.

NUM 6:22  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 6:23  Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall
 bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

NUM 6:24  The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:

NUM 6:25  The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:

NUM 6:26  The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.

NUM 6:27  And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will
 bless them.

NUM 7:1  And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
 tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments
 thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed
 them, and sanctified them;

NUM 7:2  That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who
 were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered,
 offered:

NUM 7:3  And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons,
 and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and
 they brought them before the tabernacle.

NUM 7:4  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 7:5  Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle
 of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man
 according to his service.

NUM 7:6  And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
 Levites.

NUM 7:7  Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according
 to their service:

NUM 7:8  And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari,
 according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the
 priest.

NUM 7:9  But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the
 sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders.

NUM 7:10  And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that
 it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.

NUM 7:11  And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each
 prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

 anointed, by the princes of Israel: twelve chargers of silver, twelve silver
 bowls, twelve spoons of gold:

NUM 7:85  Each charger of silver weighing an hundred and thirty shekels, each
 bowl seventy: all the silver vessels weighed two thousand and four hundred
 shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

NUM 7:86  The golden spoons were twelve, full of incense, weighing ten shekels
 apiece, after the shekel of the sanctuary: all the gold of the spoons was an
 hundred and twenty shekels.

NUM 7:87  All the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks, the rams
 twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their meat offering: and the
 kids of the goats for sin offering twelve.

NUM 7:88  And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were twenty
 and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats sixty, the lambs of the first
 year sixty. This was the dedication of the altar, after that it was anointed.

NUM 7:89  And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to
 speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the
 mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony, from between the two
 cherubims: and he spake unto him.

NUM 8:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 8:2  Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the
 seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.

NUM 8:3  And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the
 candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.

NUM 8:4  And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft
 thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the
 pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick.

NUM 8:5  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 8:6  Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.

NUM 8:7  And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of
 purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash
 their clothes, and so make themselves clean.

NUM 8:8  Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine
 flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin
 offering.

NUM 8:9  And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
 congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of
 Israel together:

NUM 8:10  And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of
 Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

NUM 8:11  And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering
 of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD.

NUM 8:12  And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks:
 and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt
 offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites.

NUM 8:13  And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and
 offer them for an offering unto the LORD.

NUM 8:14  Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of
 Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.

NUM 8:15  And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the
 tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them
 for an offering.

NUM 8:16  For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel;
 instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the
 children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.

NUM 8:17  For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man
 and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I
 sanctified them for myself.

NUM 8:18  And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of
 Israel.

NUM 8:19  And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from
 among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel
 in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the
 children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel,
 when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

NUM 8:20  And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of
 Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses
 concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.

NUM 8:21  And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and
 Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an
 atonement for them to cleanse them.

NUM 8:22  And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
 tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD
 had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.

NUM 8:23  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 8:24  This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five
 years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the
 tabernacle of the congregation:

NUM 8:25  And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the
 service thereof, and shall serve no more:

NUM 8:26  But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the
 congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do
 unto the Levites touching their charge.

NUM 9:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first
 month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt,
 saying,

NUM 9:2  Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed
 season.

NUM 9:3  In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his
 appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the
 ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

NUM 9:4  And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the
 passover.

NUM 9:5  And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at
 even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded
 Moses, so did the children of Israel.

NUM 9:6  And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a
 man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before
 Moses and before Aaron on that day:

NUM 9:7  And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man:
 wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in
 his appointed season among the children of Israel?

NUM 9:8  And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD
 will command concerning you.

NUM 9:9  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 9:10  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of
 your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey
 afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.

NUM 9:11  The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
 it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

NUM 9:12  They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of
 it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.

NUM 9:13  But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to
 keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people:
 because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that
 man shall bear his sin.

NUM 9:14  And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover
 unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according
 to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for
 the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.

NUM 9:15  And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered
 the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon
 the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.

NUM 9:16  So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of
 fire by night.

NUM 9:17  And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that
 the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud
 abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.

NUM 9:18  At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and
 at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon
 the tabernacle they rested in their tents.

NUM 9:19  And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then
 the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.

NUM 9:20  And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;
 according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and
 according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.

NUM 9:21  And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and
 that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it
 was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

NUM 9:22  Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud
 tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode
 in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

NUM 9:23  At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the
 commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at
 the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

NUM 10:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 10:2  Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make
 them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the
 journeying of the camps.

NUM 10:3  And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble
 themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

NUM 10:4  And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are
 heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.

NUM 10:5  When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts
 shall go forward.

NUM 10:6  When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the
 south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their
 journeys.

NUM 10:7  But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow,
 but ye shall not sound an alarm.

NUM 10:8  And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and
 they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.

NUM 10:9  And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth
 you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be
 remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.

NUM 10:10  Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and
 in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your
 burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they
 may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.

NUM 10:11  And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the
 second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the
 testimony.

NUM 10:12  And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness
 of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.

NUM 10:13  And they first took their journey according to the commandment
 of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

NUM 10:14  In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of
 Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of
 Amminadab.

NUM 10:15  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
 Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

NUM 10:16  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab
 the son of Helon.

NUM 10:17  And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the
 sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

NUM 10:18  And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according
 to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

NUM 10:19  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
 Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

NUM 10:20  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph
 the son of Deuel.

NUM 10:21  And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other
 did set up the tabernacle against they came.

NUM 10:22  And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward
 according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.

NUM 10:23  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
 Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

NUM 10:24  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
 Abidan the son of Gideoni.

NUM 10:25  And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,
 which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his
 host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

NUM 10:26  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel
 the son of Ocran.

NUM 10:27  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira
 the son of Enan.

NUM 10:28  Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according
 to their armies, when they set forward.

NUM 10:29  And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses'
 father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I
 will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD
 hath spoken good concerning Israel.

NUM 10:30  And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own
 land, and to my kindred.

NUM 10:31  And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest
 how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of
 eyes.

NUM 10:32  And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what
 goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.

NUM 10:33  And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey:
 and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days'
 journey, to search out a resting place for them.

NUM 10:34  And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out
 of the camp.

NUM 10:35  And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise
 up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee
 flee before thee.

NUM 10:36  And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands
 of Israel.

NUM 11:1  And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD
 heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among
 them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.

NUM 11:2  And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
 LORD, the fire was quenched.

NUM 11:3  And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the
 LORD burnt among them.

NUM 11:4  And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the
 children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?

NUM 11:5  We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
 cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:

NUM 11:6  But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this
 manna, before our eyes.

NUM 11:7  And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the
 colour of bdellium.

NUM 11:8  And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills,
 or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the
 taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

NUM 11:9  And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon
 it.

NUM 11:10  Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every
 man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly;
 Moses also was displeased.

NUM 11:11  And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
 servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest
 the burden of all this people upon me?

NUM 11:12  Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou
 shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth
 the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?

NUM 11:13  Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they
 weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

NUM 11:14  I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy
 for me.

NUM 11:15  And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if
 I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.

NUM 11:16  And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
 elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and
 officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation,
 that they may stand there with thee.

NUM 11:17  And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
 of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall
 bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.

NUM 11:18  And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
 morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD,
 saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt:
 therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

NUM 11:19  Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten
 days, nor twenty days;

NUM 11:20  But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it
 be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among
 you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?

NUM 11:21  And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
 thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may
 eat a whole month.

NUM 11:22  Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them?
 or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice
 them?

NUM 11:23  And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? thou
 shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.

NUM 11:24  And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and
 gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round
 about the tabernacle.

NUM 11:25  And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took
 of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it
 came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and
 did not cease.

NUM 11:26  But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one
 was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them;
 and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the
 tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.

NUM 11:27  And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad
 do prophesy in the camp.

NUM 11:28  And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young
 men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

NUM 11:29  And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that
 all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit
 upon them!

NUM 11:30  And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

NUM 11:31  And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from
 the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this
 side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the
 camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.

NUM 11:32  And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all
 the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered
 ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the
 camp.

NUM 11:33  And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
 chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD
 smote the people with a very great plague.

NUM 11:34  And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there
 they buried the people that lusted.

NUM 11:35  And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and
 abode at Hazeroth.

NUM 12:1  And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian
 woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.

NUM 12:2  And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not
 spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.

NUM 12:3  (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon
 the face of the earth.)

NUM 12:4  And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto
 Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they
 three came out.

NUM 12:5  And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the
 door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came
 forth.

NUM 12:6  And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I
 the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him
 in a dream.

NUM 12:7  My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

NUM 12:8  With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in
 dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then
 were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?

NUM 12:9  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.

NUM 12:10  And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam
 became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she
 was leprous.

NUM 12:11  And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not
 the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.

NUM 12:12  Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when
 he cometh out of his mother's womb.

NUM 12:13  And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
 beseech thee.

NUM 12:14  And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her
 face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp
 seven days, and after that let her be received in again.

NUM 12:15  And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people
 journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

NUM 12:16  And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the
 wilderness of Paran.

NUM 13:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 13:2  Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give
 unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a
 man, every one a ruler among them.

NUM 13:3  And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
 wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.

NUM 13:4  And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son
 of Zaccur.

NUM 13:5  Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

NUM 13:6  Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

NUM 13:7  Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

NUM 13:8  Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

NUM 13:9  Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

NUM 13:10  Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

NUM 13:11  Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the
 son of Susi.

NUM 13:12  Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

NUM 13:13  Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

NUM 13:14  Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

NUM 13:15  Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

NUM 13:16  These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land.
 And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

NUM 13:17  And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto
 them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:

NUM 13:18  And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth therein,
 whether they be strong or weak, few or many;

NUM 13:19  And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad;
 and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong
 holds;

NUM 13:20  And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be
 wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit
 of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.

NUM 13:21  So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin
 unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

NUM 13:22  And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman,
 Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven
 years before Zoan in Egypt.)

NUM 13:23  And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a
 branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff;
 and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

NUM 13:24  The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of
 grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

NUM 13:25  And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

NUM 13:26  And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
 congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to
 Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and
 shewed them the fruit of the land.

NUM 13:27  And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou
 sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit
 of it.

NUM 13:28  Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the
 cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak
 there.

NUM 13:29  The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and
 the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites
 dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

NUM 13:30  And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at
 once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

NUM 13:31  But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up
 against the people; for they are stronger than we.

NUM 13:32  And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
 searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have
 gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all
 the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.

NUM 13:33  And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the
 giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their
 sight.

NUM 14:1  And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the
 people wept that night.

NUM 14:2  And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
 Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died
 in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!

NUM 14:3  And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the
 sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better
 for us to return into Egypt?

NUM 14:4  And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us
 return into Egypt.

NUM 14:5  Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
 of the congregation of the children of Israel.

NUM 14:6  And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were
 of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:

NUM 14:7  And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,
 saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good
 land.

NUM 14:8  If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and
 give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.

NUM 14:9  Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the
 land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the
 LORD is with us: fear them not.

NUM 14:10  But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory
 of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the
 children of Israel.

NUM 14:11  And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me?
 and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have
 shewed among them?

NUM 14:12  I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will
 make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

NUM 14:13  And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for
 thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)

NUM 14:14  And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have
 heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to
 face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them,
 by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

NUM 14:15  Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations
 which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

NUM 14:16  Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land
 which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.

NUM 14:17  And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,
 according as thou hast spoken, saying,

NUM 14:18  The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity
 and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity
 of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.

NUM 14:19  Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto
 the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt
 even until now.

NUM 14:20  And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:

NUM 14:21  But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory
 of the LORD.

NUM 14:22  Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,
 which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten
 times, and have not hearkened to my voice;

NUM 14:23  Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers,
 neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

NUM 14:24  But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and
 hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and
 his seed shall possess it.

NUM 14:25  (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
 Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

NUM 14:26  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

NUM 14:27  How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur
 against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they
 murmur against me.

NUM 14:28  Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken
 in mine ears, so will I do to you:

NUM 14:29  Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were
 numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and
 upward which have murmured against me.

NUM 14:30  Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware
 to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the
 son of Nun.

NUM 14:31  But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I
 bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.

NUM 14:32  But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.

NUM 14:33  And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and
 bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.

NUM 14:34  After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even
 forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty
 years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.

NUM 14:35  I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
 congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they
 shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

NUM 14:36  And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and
 made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander
 upon the land,

NUM 14:37  Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died
 by the plague before the LORD.

NUM 14:38  But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
 were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.

NUM 14:39  And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and
 the people mourned greatly.

NUM 14:40  And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top
 of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which
 the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.

NUM 14:41  And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
 of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.

NUM 14:42  Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten
 before your enemies.

NUM 14:43  For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye
 shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore
 the LORD will not be with you.

NUM 14:44  But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark
 of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.

NUM 14:45  Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in
 that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.

NUM 15:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 15:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come
 into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,

NUM 15:3  And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or
 a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn
 feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:

NUM 15:4  Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat
 offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of
 oil.

NUM 15:5  And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou
 prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.

NUM 15:6  Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals
 of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

NUM 15:7  And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of
 wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

NUM 15:8  And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a
 sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD:

NUM 15:9  Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth
 deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

NUM 15:10  And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for
 an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

NUM 15:11  Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a
 lamb, or a kid.

NUM 15:12  According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to
 every one according to their number.

NUM 15:13  All that are born of the country shall do these things after this
 manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the
 LORD.

NUM 15:14  And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in
 your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
 unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

NUM 15:15  One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also
 for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your
 generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.

NUM 15:16  One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that
 sojourneth with you.

NUM 15:17  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 15:18  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come
 into the land whither I bring you,

NUM 15:19  Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye
 shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

NUM 15:20  Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave
 offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye
 heave it.

NUM 15:21  Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave
 offering in your generations.

NUM 15:22  And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which
 the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,

NUM 15:23  Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from
 the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your
 generations;

NUM 15:24  Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the
 knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one
 young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with
 his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one
 kid of the goats for a sin offering.

NUM 15:25  And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation
 of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is
 ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto
 the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:

NUM 15:26  And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of
 Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people
 were in ignorance.

NUM 15:27  And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she
 goat of the first year for a sin offering.

NUM 15:28  And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth
 ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an
 atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.

NUM 15:29  Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both
 for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that
 sojourneth among them.

NUM 15:30  But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born
 in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul
 shall be cut off from among his people.

NUM 15:31  Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his
 commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon
 him.

NUM 15:32  And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found
 a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

NUM 15:33  And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and
 Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

NUM 15:34  And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be
 done to him.

NUM 15:35  And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death:
 all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.

NUM 15:36  And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned
 him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.

NUM 15:37  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 15:38  Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them
 fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and
 that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:

NUM 15:39  And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and
 remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not
 after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:

NUM 15:40  That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto
 your God.

NUM 15:41  I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt,
 to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

NUM 16:1  Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and
 Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of
 Reuben, took men:

NUM 16:2  And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of
 Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the
 congregation, men of renown:

NUM 16:3  And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against
 Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the
 congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them:
 wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?

NUM 16:4  And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:

NUM 16:5  And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to
 morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to
 come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near
 unto him.

NUM 16:6  This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

NUM 16:7  And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to
 morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be
 holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

NUM 16:8  And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:

NUM 16:9  Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath
 separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself
 to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the
 congregation to minister unto them?

NUM 16:10  And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons
 of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

NUM 16:11  For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together
 against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?

NUM 16:12  And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which
 said, We will not come up:

NUM 16:13  Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that
 floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make
 thyself altogether a prince over us?

NUM 16:14  Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk
 and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out
 the eyes of these men? we will not come up.

NUM 16:15  And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou
 their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one
 of them.

NUM 16:16  And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the
 LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

NUM 16:17  And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye
 before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou
 also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.

NUM 16:18  And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid
 incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
 with Moses and Aaron.

NUM 16:19  And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door
 of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared
 unto all the congregation.

NUM 16:20  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

NUM 16:21  Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume
 them in a moment.

NUM 16:22  And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the
 spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the
 congregation?

NUM 16:23  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 16:24  Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
 tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

NUM 16:25  And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of
 Israel followed him.

NUM 16:26  And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from
 the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest ye be
 consumed in all their sins.

NUM 16:27  So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on
 every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their
 tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.

NUM 16:28  And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to
 do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.

NUM 16:29  If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited
 after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.

NUM 16:30  But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and
 swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick
 into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.

NUM 16:31  And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these
 words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:

NUM 16:32  And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their
 houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.

NUM 16:33  They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the
 pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the
 congregation.

NUM 16:34  And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them:
 for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

NUM 16:35  And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two
 hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

NUM 16:36  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 16:37  Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the
 censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are
 hallowed.

NUM 16:38  The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make
 them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before
 the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the
 children of Israel.

NUM 16:39  And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that
 were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the
 altar:

NUM 16:40  To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger,
 which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the
 LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by
 the hand of Moses.

NUM 16:41  But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel
 murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people
 of the LORD.

NUM 16:42  And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against
 Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the
 congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD
 appeared.

NUM 16:43  And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.

NUM 16:44  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 16:45  Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as
 in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

NUM 16:46  And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from
 off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and
 make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the
 plague is begun.

NUM 16:47  And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the
 congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put
 on incense, and made an atonement for the people.

NUM 16:48  And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was
 stayed.

NUM 16:49  Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven
 hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.

NUM 16:50  And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation: and the plague was stayed.

NUM 17:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 17:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a
 rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according
 to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon
 his rod.

NUM 17:3  And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod
 shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

NUM 17:4  And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
 before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

NUM 17:5  And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose,
 shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the
 children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.

NUM 17:6  And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their
 princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their
 fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.

NUM 17:7  And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of
 witness.

NUM 17:8  And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
 tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi
 was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded
 almonds.

NUM 17:9  And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the
 children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.

NUM 17:10  And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the
 testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite
 take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.

NUM 17:11  And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

NUM 17:12  And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die,
 we perish, we all perish.

NUM 17:13  Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD
 shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

NUM 18:1  And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's
 house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy
 sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.

NUM 18:2  And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father,
 bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto
 thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of
 witness.

NUM 18:3  And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle:
 only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar,
 that neither they, nor ye also, die.

NUM 18:4  And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
 tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a
 stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

NUM 18:5  And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the
 altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.

NUM 18:6  And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the
 children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the
 service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

NUM 18:7  Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office
 for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have
 given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger
 that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

NUM 18:8  And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the
 charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of
 Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy
 sons, by an ordinance for ever.

NUM 18:9  This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire:
 every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin
 offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall
 render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.

NUM 18:10  In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it:
 it shall be holy unto thee.

NUM 18:11  And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the
 wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to
 thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one
 that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.

NUM 18:12  All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the
 wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them
 have I given thee.

NUM 18:13  And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring
 unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall
 eat of it.

NUM 18:14  Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.

NUM 18:15  Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring
 unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless
 the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean
 beasts shalt thou redeem.

NUM 18:16  And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
 redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after
 the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.

NUM 18:17  But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the
 firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt
 sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering
 made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

NUM 18:18  And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the
 right shoulder are thine.

NUM 18:19  All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of
 Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters
 with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before
 the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.

NUM 18:20  And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance
 in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and
 thine inheritance among the children of Israel.

NUM 18:21  And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in
 Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the
 service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

NUM 18:22  Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
 tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.

NUM 18:23  But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
 congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for
 ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have
 no inheritance.

NUM 18:24  But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an
 heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit:
 therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have
 no inheritance.

NUM 18:25  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 18:26  Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the
 children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your
 inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD,
 even a tenth part of the tithe.

NUM 18:27  And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though
 it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.

NUM 18:28  Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your
 tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof
 the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.

NUM 18:29  Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the
 LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.

NUM 18:30  Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best
 thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase
 of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.

NUM 18:31  And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it
 is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.

NUM 18:32  And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from
 it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children
 of Israel, lest ye die.

NUM 19:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

NUM 19:2  This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded,
 saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer
 without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:

NUM 19:3  And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her
 forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:

NUM 19:4  And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and
 sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation
 seven times:

NUM 19:5  And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her
 flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:

NUM 19:6  And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and
 cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

NUM 19:7  Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh
 in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be
 unclean until the even.

NUM 19:8  And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe
 his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

NUM 19:9  And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and
 lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the
 congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a
 purification for sin.

NUM 19:10  And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
 clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of
 Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for
 ever.

NUM 19:11  He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven
 days.

NUM 19:12  He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh
 day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the
 seventh day he shall not be clean.

NUM 19:13  Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
 purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul
 shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not
 sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.

NUM 19:14  This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the
 tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.

NUM 19:15  And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is
 unclean.

NUM 19:16  And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open
 fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean
 seven days.

NUM 19:17  And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt
 heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a
 vessel:

NUM 19:18  And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and
 sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons
 that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead,
 or a grave:

NUM 19:19  And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third
 day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify
 himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean
 at even.

NUM 19:20  But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,
 that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath
 defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been
 sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.

NUM 19:21  And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
 sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that
 toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.

NUM 19:22  And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the
 soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

NUM 20:1  Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into
 the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and
 Miriam died there, and was buried there.

NUM 20:2  And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
 themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

NUM 20:3  And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we
 had died when our brethren died before the LORD!

NUM 20:4  And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this
 wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?

NUM 20:5  And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in
 unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of
 pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.

NUM 20:6  And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the
 door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces:
 and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.

NUM 20:7  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 20:8  Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron
 thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give
 forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so
 thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.

NUM 20:9  And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.

NUM 20:10  And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the
 rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out
 of this rock?

NUM 20:11  And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock
 twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and
 their beasts also.

NUM 20:12  And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not,
 to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not
 bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.

NUM 20:13  This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove
 with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

NUM 20:14  And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus
 saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:

NUM 20:15  How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a
 long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:

NUM 20:16  And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an
 angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh,
 a city in the uttermost of thy border:

NUM 20:17  Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass
 through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the
 water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn
 to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.

NUM 20:18  And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out
 against thee with the sword.

NUM 20:19  And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high
 way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I
 will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.

NUM 20:20  And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against
 him with much people, and with a strong hand.

NUM 20:21  Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
 wherefore Israel turned away from him.

NUM 20:22  And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed
 from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

NUM 20:23  And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast
 of the land of Edom, saying,

NUM 20:24  Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into
 the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled
 against my word at the water of Meribah.

NUM 20:25  Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:

NUM 20:26  And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son:
 and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.

NUM 20:27  And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor
 in the sight of all the congregation.

NUM 20:28  And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar
 his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar
 came down from the mount.

NUM 20:29  And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned
 for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

NUM 21:1  And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard
 tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against
 Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

NUM 21:2  And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed
 deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.

NUM 21:3  And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the
 Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called
 the name of the place Hormah.

NUM 21:4  And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to
 compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged
 because of the way.

NUM 21:5  And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have
 ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no
 bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.

NUM 21:6  And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the
 people; and much people of Israel died.

NUM 21:7  Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we
 have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he
 take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.

NUM 21:8  And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it
 upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when
 he looketh upon it, shall live.

NUM 21:9  And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it
 came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the
 serpent of brass, he lived.

NUM 21:10  And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

NUM 21:11  And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the
 wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

NUM 21:12  From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

NUM 21:13  From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
 which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for
 Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

NUM 21:14  Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he
 did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,

NUM 21:15  And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of
 Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.

NUM 21:16  And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD
 spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.

NUM 21:17  Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:

NUM 21:18  The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by
 the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness
 they went to Mattanah:

NUM 21:19  And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:

NUM 21:20  And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab,
 to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

NUM 21:21  And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

NUM 21:22  Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or
 into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will
 go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.

NUM 21:23  And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but
 Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the
 wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

NUM 21:24  And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his
 land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border
 of the children of Ammon was strong.

NUM 21:25  And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities
 of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.

NUM 21:26  For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had
 fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his
 hand, even unto Arnon.

NUM 21:27  Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let
 the city of Sihon be built and prepared:

NUM 21:28  For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of
 Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of
 Arnon.

NUM 21:29  Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath
 given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon
 king of the Amorites.

NUM 21:30  We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we
 have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.

NUM 21:31  Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

NUM 21:32  And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
 thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

NUM 21:33  And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of
 Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.

NUM 21:34  And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him
 into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as
 thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

NUM 21:35  So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was
 none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

NUM 22:1  And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of
 Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

NUM 22:2  And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the
 Amorites.

NUM 22:3  And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and
 Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.

NUM 22:4  And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick
 up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.
 And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.

NUM 22:5  He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor,
 which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him,
 saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the
 face of the earth, and they abide over against me:

NUM 22:6  Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are
 too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and
 that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest
 is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.

NUM 22:7  And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
 rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake
 unto him the words of Balak.

NUM 22:8  And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you
 word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode
 with Balaam.

NUM 22:9  And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?

NUM 22:10  And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
 hath sent unto me, saying,

NUM 22:11  Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face
 of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to
 overcome them, and drive them out.

NUM 22:12  And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt
 not curse the people: for they are blessed.

NUM 22:13  And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of
 Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go
 with you.

NUM 22:14  And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said,
 Balaam refuseth to come with us.

NUM 22:15  And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than
 they.

NUM 22:16  And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son
 of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:

NUM 22:17  For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do
 whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this
 people.

NUM 22:18  And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak
 would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word
 of the LORD my God, to do less or more.

NUM 22:19  Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may
 know what the LORD will say unto me more.

NUM 22:20  And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men
 come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall
 say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

NUM 22:21  And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went
 with the princes of Moab.

NUM 22:22  And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the
 LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon
 his ass, and his two servants were with him.

NUM 22:23  And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his
 sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went
 into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.

NUM 22:24  But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall
 being on this side, and a wall on that side.

NUM 22:25  And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto
 the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.

NUM 22:26  And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place,
 where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

NUM 22:27  And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under
 Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.

NUM 22:28  And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam,
 What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?

NUM 22:29  And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would
 there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.

NUM 22:30  And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou
 hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so
 unto thee? And he said, Nay.

NUM 22:31  Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the
 LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down
 his head, and fell flat on his face.

NUM 22:32  And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten
 thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because
 thy way is perverse before me:

NUM 22:33  And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she
 had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.

NUM 22:34  And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I
 knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it
 displease thee, I will get me back again.

NUM 22:35  And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but
 only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam
 went with the princes of Balak.

NUM 22:36  And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him
 unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost
 coast.

NUM 22:37  And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to
 call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote
 thee to honour?

NUM 22:38  And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any
 power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that
 shall I speak.

NUM 22:39  And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

NUM 22:40  And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the
 princes that were with him.

NUM 22:41  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
 brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the
 utmost part of the people.

NUM 23:1  And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare
 me here seven oxen and seven rams.

NUM 23:2  And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on
 every altar a bullock and a ram.

NUM 23:3  And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will
 go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me
 I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.

NUM 23:4  And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven
 altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.

NUM 23:5  And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto
 Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

NUM 23:6  And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice,
 he, and all the princes of Moab.

NUM 23:7  And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath
 brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse
 me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

NUM 23:8  How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,
 whom the LORD hath not defied?

NUM 23:9  For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold
 him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the
 nations.

NUM 23:10  Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part
 of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like
 his!

NUM 23:11  And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee
 to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.

NUM 23:12  And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which
 the LORD hath put in my mouth?

NUM 23:13  And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another
 place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part
 of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.

NUM 23:14  And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
 Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every
 altar.

NUM 23:15  And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I
 meet the LORD yonder.

NUM 23:16  And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go
 again unto Balak, and say thus.

NUM 23:17  And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and
 the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD
 spoken?

NUM 23:18  And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear;
 hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

NUM 23:19  God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that
 he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he
 spoken, and shall he not make it good?

NUM 23:20  Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed;
 and I cannot reverse it.

NUM 23:21  He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
 perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king
 is among them.

NUM 23:22  God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an
 unicorn.

NUM 23:23  Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any
 divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob
 and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

NUM 23:24  Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up
 himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and
 drink the blood of the slain.

NUM 23:25  And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless
 them at all.

NUM 23:26  But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying,
 All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?

NUM 23:27  And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee
 unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me
 them from thence.

NUM 23:28  And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward
 Jeshimon.

NUM 23:29  And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare
 me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

NUM 23:30  And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on
 every altar.

NUM 24:1  And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went
 not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward
 the wilderness.

NUM 24:2  And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents
 according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.

NUM 24:3  And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
 said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

NUM 24:4  He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision
 of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:

NUM 24:5  How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!

NUM 24:6  As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side,
 as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees
 beside the waters.

NUM 24:7  He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in
 many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be
 exalted.

NUM 24:8  God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
 of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their
 bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.

NUM 24:9  He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall
 stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth
 thee.

NUM 24:10  And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands
 together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies,
 and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.

NUM 24:11  Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto
 great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.

NUM 24:12  And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which
 thou sentest unto me, saying,

NUM 24:13  If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot
 go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own
 mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?

NUM 24:14  And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will
 advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.

NUM 24:15  And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
 said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

NUM 24:16  He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge
 of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a
 trance, but having his eyes open:

NUM 24:17  I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh:
 there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of
 Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of
 Sheth.

NUM 24:18  And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for
 his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

NUM 24:19  Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
 destroy him that remaineth of the city.

NUM 24:20  And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,
 Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he
 perish for ever.

NUM 24:21  And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,
 Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.

NUM 24:22  Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry
 thee away captive.

NUM 24:23  And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God
 doeth this!

NUM 24:24  And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict
 Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.

NUM 24:25  And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak
 also went his way.

NUM 25:1  And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom
 with the daughters of Moab.

NUM 25:2  And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the
 people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

NUM 25:3  And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD
 was kindled against Israel.

NUM 25:4  And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and
 hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the
 LORD may be turned away from Israel.

NUM 25:5  And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men
 that were joined unto Baalpeor.

NUM 25:6  And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his
 brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all
 the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door
 of the tabernacle of the congregation.

NUM 25:7  And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
 saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his
 hand;

NUM 25:8  And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both
 of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the
 plague was stayed from the children of Israel.

NUM 25:9  And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.

NUM 25:10  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 25:11  Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath
 turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my
 sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.

NUM 25:12  Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

NUM 25:13  And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of
 an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an
 atonement for the children of Israel.

NUM 25:14  Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain
 with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief
 house among the Simeonites.

NUM 25:15  And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the
 daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.

NUM 25:16  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 25:17  Vex the Midianites, and smite them:

NUM 25:18  For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you
 in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince
 of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's
 sake.

NUM 26:1  And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses
 and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

NUM 26:2  Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from
 twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are
 able to go to war in Israel.

NUM 26:3  And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of
 Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

NUM 26:4  Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the
 LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the
 land of Egypt.

 Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the
 LORD:

NUM 26:10  And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with
 Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and
 fifty men: and they became a sign.

NUM 26:11  Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.

NUM 26:52  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 26:53  Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according
 to the number of names.

NUM 26:54  To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt
 give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given
 according to those that were numbered of him.

NUM 26:55  Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the
 names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.

NUM 26:56  According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between
 many and few.

NUM 26:57  And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their

 LORD.

NUM 26:62  And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand,
 all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the
 children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the
 children of Israel.

NUM 26:63  These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest,
 who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near
 Jericho.

NUM 26:64  But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the
 priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness
 of Sinai.

NUM 26:65  For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the
 wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of
 Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

NUM 27:1  Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of
 Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh
 the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah,
 Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.

NUM 27:2  And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and
 before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle
 of the congregation, saying,

NUM 27:3  Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company
 of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of
 Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.

NUM 27:4  Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family,
 because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the
 brethren of our father.

NUM 27:5  And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.

NUM 27:6  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 27:7  The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them
 a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt
 cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.

NUM 27:8  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man
 die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his
 daughter.

NUM 27:9  And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto
 his brethren.

NUM 27:10  And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto
 his father's brethren.

NUM 27:11  And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
 inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall
 possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of
 judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.

NUM 27:12  And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount
 Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.

NUM 27:13  And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy
 people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.

NUM 27:14  For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the
 strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes:
 that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.

NUM 27:15  And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,

NUM 27:16  Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over
 the congregation,

NUM 27:17  Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and
 which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation
 of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.

NUM 27:18  And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man
 in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;

NUM 27:19  And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
 congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

NUM 27:20  And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the
 congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

NUM 27:21  And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel
 for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go
 out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of
 Israel with him, even all the congregation.

NUM 27:22  And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set
 him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:

NUM 27:23  And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD
 commanded by the hand of Moses.

NUM 28:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 28:2  Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and
 my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye
 observe to offer unto me in their due season.

NUM 28:3  And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which
 ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by
 day, for a continual burnt offering.

NUM 28:4  The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb
 shalt thou offer at even;

NUM 28:5  And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled
 with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

NUM 28:6  It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai
 for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

NUM 28:7  And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for
 the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured
 unto the LORD for a drink offering.

NUM 28:8  And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering
 of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a
 sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

NUM 28:9  And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and
 two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink
 offering thereof:

NUM 28:10  This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual
 burnt offering, and his drink offering.

NUM 28:11  And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering
 unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year
 without spot;

NUM 28:12  And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with
 oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering,
 mingled with oil, for one ram;

NUM 28:13  And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
 offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice
 made by fire unto the LORD.

NUM 28:14  And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a
 bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin
 unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months
 of the year.

NUM 28:15  And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be
 offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

NUM 28:16  And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the
 LORD.

NUM 28:17  And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days
 shall unleavened bread be eaten.

NUM 28:18  In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner
 of servile work therein:

NUM 28:19  But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering
 unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first
 year: they shall be unto you without blemish:

NUM 28:20  And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three
 tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;

NUM 28:21  A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the
 seven lambs:

NUM 28:22  And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

NUM 28:23  Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which
 is for a continual burnt offering.

NUM 28:24  After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days,
 the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it
 shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

NUM 28:25  And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall
 do no servile work.

NUM 28:26  Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat
 offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy

 offerings.

NUM 29:1  And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall

 according unto their manner, for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire
 unto the LORD.

NUM 29:7  And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy
 convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall not do any work
 therein:

NUM 29:8  But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour;
 one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they shall be

 the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the
 manner:

NUM 29:25  And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual
 burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

NUM 29:26  And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs
 of the first year without spot:

NUM 29:27  And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks,
 for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after
 the manner:

NUM 29:28  And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
 offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

NUM 29:29  And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs
 of the first year without blemish:

NUM 29:30  And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks,
 for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after
 the manner:

NUM 29:31  And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
 offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

NUM 29:32  And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs
 of the first year without blemish:

NUM 29:33  And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks,
 for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after
 the manner:

NUM 29:34  And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
 offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

NUM 29:35  On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do no
 servile work therein:

NUM 29:36  But ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a
 sweet savour unto the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven lambs of the first
 year without blemish:

NUM 29:37  Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock, for
 the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the
 manner:

NUM 29:38  And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
 offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

NUM 29:39  These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts, beside
 your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, and for
 your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for your peace
 offerings.

NUM 29:40  And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD
 commanded Moses.

NUM 30:1  And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children
 of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.

NUM 30:2  If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul
 with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that
 proceedeth out of his mouth.

NUM 30:3  If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond,
 being in her father's house in her youth;

NUM 30:4  And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound
 her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall
 stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.

NUM 30:5  But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of
 her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and
 the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.

NUM 30:6  And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought
 out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

NUM 30:7  And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that
 he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her
 soul shall stand.

NUM 30:8  But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then
 he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her
 lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall
 forgive her.

NUM 30:9  But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they
 have bound their souls, shall stand against her.

NUM 30:10  And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond
 with an oath;

NUM 30:11  And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed
 her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound
 her soul shall stand.

NUM 30:12  But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard
 them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or
 concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them
 void; and the LORD shall forgive her.

NUM 30:13  Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband
 may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

NUM 30:14  But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day;
 then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he
 confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard
 them.

NUM 30:15  But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard
 them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

NUM 30:16  These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a
 man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth
 in her father's house.

NUM 31:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 31:2  Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou
 be gathered unto thy people.

NUM 31:3  And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto
 the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of
 Midian.

NUM 31:4  Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall
 ye send to the war.

NUM 31:5  So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of
 every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

NUM 31:6  And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and
 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy
 instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.

NUM 31:7  And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses;
 and they slew all the males.

NUM 31:8  And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were
 slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of
 Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.

NUM 31:9  And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and
 their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their
 flocks, and all their goods.

NUM 31:10  And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their
 goodly castles, with fire.

NUM 31:11  And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of
 beasts.

NUM 31:12  And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto
 Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of
 Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near
 Jericho.

NUM 31:13  And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
 congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.

NUM 31:14  And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains
 over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.

NUM 31:15  And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

NUM 31:16  Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of
 Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there
 was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.

NUM 31:17  Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every
 woman that hath known man by lying with him.

NUM 31:18  But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with
 him, keep alive for yourselves.

NUM 31:19  And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed
 any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and
 your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.

NUM 31:20  And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all
 work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

NUM 31:21  And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the
 battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;

NUM 31:22  Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the
 lead,

NUM 31:23  Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the
 fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water
 of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the
 water.

NUM 31:24  And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be
 clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

NUM 31:25  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 31:26  Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast,
 thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:

NUM 31:27  And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war
 upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:

NUM 31:28  And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to
 battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and
 of the asses, and of the sheep:

NUM 31:29  Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an
 heave offering of the LORD.

NUM 31:30  And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of
 fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all
 manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge
 of the tabernacle of the LORD.

NUM 31:31  And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.

NUM 31:32  And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had
 caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand
 sheep,

NUM 31:33  And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,

NUM 31:34  And threescore and one thousand asses,

NUM 31:35  And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not
 known man by lying with him.

NUM 31:36  And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war,
 was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five
 hundred sheep:

NUM 31:37  And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore
 and fifteen.

NUM 31:38  And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's
 tribute was threescore and twelve.

NUM 31:39  And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the
 LORD's tribute was threescore and one.

NUM 31:40  And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute
 was thirty and two persons.

NUM 31:41  And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering,
 unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.

NUM 31:42  And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the
 men that warred,

NUM 31:43  (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred
 thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,

NUM 31:44  And thirty and six thousand beeves,

NUM 31:45  And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,

NUM 31:46  And sixteen thousand persons;)

NUM 31:47  Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of
 fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept
 the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

NUM 31:48  And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains
 of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:

NUM 31:49  And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men
 of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.

NUM 31:50  We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man
 hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and
 tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.

NUM 31:51  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all
 wrought jewels.

NUM 31:52  And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD,
 of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen
 thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

NUM 31:53  (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

NUM 31:54  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of
 thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the
 congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.

NUM 32:1  Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great
 multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of
 Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;

NUM 32:2  The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto
 Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation,
 saying,

NUM 32:3  Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and
 Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

NUM 32:4  Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of
 Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:

NUM 32:5  Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this
 land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over
 Jordan.

NUM 32:6  And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
 Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?

NUM 32:7  And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from
 going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?

NUM 32:8  Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the
 land.

NUM 32:9  For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
 land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should
 not go into the land which the LORD had given them.

NUM 32:10  And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
 saying,

NUM 32:11  Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years
 old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto
 Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:

NUM 32:12  Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of
 Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.

NUM 32:13  And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them
 wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done
 evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.

NUM 32:14  And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of
 sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.

NUM 32:15  For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them
 in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

NUM 32:16  And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here
 for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:

NUM 32:17  But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel,
 until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell
 in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

NUM 32:18  We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel
 have inherited every man his inheritance.

NUM 32:19  For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward;
 because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.

NUM 32:20  And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go
 armed before the LORD to war,

NUM 32:21  And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he
 hath driven out his enemies from before him,

NUM 32:22  And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall
 return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land
 shall be your possession before the LORD.

NUM 32:23  But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD:
 and be sure your sin will find you out.

NUM 32:24  Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and
 do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.

NUM 32:25  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses,
 saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

NUM 32:26  Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be
 there in the cities of Gilead:

NUM 32:27  But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the
 LORD to battle, as my lord saith.

NUM 32:28  So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
 the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of
 Israel:

NUM 32:29  And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of
 Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the
 LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the
 land of Gilead for a possession:

NUM 32:30  But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
 possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

NUM 32:31  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying,
 As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.

NUM 32:32  We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan,
 that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.

NUM 32:33  And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the
 children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of
 Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king
 of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities
 of the country round about.

NUM 32:34  And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

NUM 32:35  And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

NUM 32:36  And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.

NUM 32:37  And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
 Kirjathaim,

NUM 32:38  And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah:
 and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.

NUM 32:39  And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and
 took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.

NUM 32:40  And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt
 therein.

NUM 32:41  And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns
 thereof, and called them Havothjair.

NUM 32:42  And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called
 it Nobah, after his own name.

NUM 33:1  These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth
 out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.

NUM 33:2  And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the
 commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their
 goings out.

NUM 33:3  And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth
 day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of
 Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.

NUM 33:4  For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had
 smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.

NUM 33:5  And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in
 Succoth.

NUM 33:6  And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the
 edge of the wilderness.

NUM 33:7  And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth, which
 is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.

NUM 33:8  And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the
 midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in the
 wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.

NUM 33:9  And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were
 twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they
 pitched there.

NUM 33:10  And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.

NUM 33:11  And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of
 Sin.

NUM 33:12  And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and
 encamped in Dophkah.

NUM 33:13  And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

NUM 33:14  And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no
 water for the people to drink.

NUM 33:15  And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of
 Sinai.

NUM 33:16  And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at
 Kibrothhattaavah.

NUM 33:17  And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth.

NUM 33:18  And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.

NUM 33:19  And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.

NUM 33:20  And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.

NUM 33:21  And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.

NUM 33:22  And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.

NUM 33:23  And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.

NUM 33:24  And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.

NUM 33:25  And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.

NUM 33:26  And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.

NUM 33:27  And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.

NUM 33:28  And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.

NUM 33:29  And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.

NUM 33:30  And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.

NUM 33:31  And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.

NUM 33:32  And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.

NUM 33:33  And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.

NUM 33:34  And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.

NUM 33:35  And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.

NUM 33:36  And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wilderness of
 Zin, which is Kadesh.

NUM 33:37  And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge
 of the land of Edom.

NUM 33:38  And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment
 of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of
 Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth
 month.

NUM 33:39  And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died
 in mount Hor.

NUM 33:40  And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of
 Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

NUM 33:41  And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.

NUM 33:42  And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.

NUM 33:43  And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.

NUM 33:44  And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the
 border of Moab.

NUM 33:45  And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.

NUM 33:46  And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim.

NUM 33:47  And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the mountains
 of Abarim, before Nebo.

NUM 33:48  And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the
 plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

NUM 33:49  And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim
 in the plains of Moab.

NUM 33:50  And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near
 Jericho, saying,

NUM 33:51  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are
 passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

NUM 33:52  Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before
 you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and
 quite pluck down all their high places:

NUM 33:53  And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell
 therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

NUM 33:54  And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your
 families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the
 fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be
 in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers
 ye shall inherit.

NUM 33:55  But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before
 you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall
 be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the
 land wherein ye dwell.

NUM 33:56  Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I
 thought to do unto them.

NUM 34:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 34:2  Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into
 the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an
 inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)

NUM 34:3  Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by
 the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the
 salt sea eastward:

NUM 34:4  And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of
 Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the
 south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:

NUM 34:5  And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of
 Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

NUM 34:6  And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a
 border: this shall be your west border.

NUM 34:7  And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall
 point out for you mount Hor:

NUM 34:8  From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of
 Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:

NUM 34:9  And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall
 be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.

NUM 34:10  And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:

NUM 34:11  And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side
 of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the
 sea of Chinnereth eastward:

NUM 34:12  And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it
 shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof
 round about.

NUM 34:13  And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land
 which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine
 tribes, and to the half tribe:

NUM 34:14  For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house
 of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house
 of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of
 Manasseh have received their inheritance:

NUM 34:15  The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on
 this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.

NUM 34:16  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 34:17  These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you:
 Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

NUM 34:18  And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by
 inheritance.

NUM 34:19  And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the
 son of Jephunneh.

NUM 34:20  And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of
 Ammihud.

NUM 34:21  Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

NUM 34:22  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of
 Jogli.

NUM 34:23  The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children
 of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

NUM 34:24  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the
 son of Shiphtan.

NUM 34:25  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan
 the son of Parnach.

NUM 34:26  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the
 son of Azzan.

NUM 34:27  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son
 of Shelomi.

NUM 34:28  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the
 son of Ammihud.

NUM 34:29  These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance
 unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

NUM 35:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near
 Jericho, saying,

NUM 35:2  Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites
 of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give
 also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.

NUM 35:3  And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them
 shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.

NUM 35:4  And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites,
 shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round
 about.

NUM 35:5  And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two
 thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west
 side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the
 city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.

NUM 35:6  And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall
 be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he
 may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.

NUM 35:7  So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty
 and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.

NUM 35:8  And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the
 children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from
 them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto
 the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.

NUM 35:9  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

NUM 35:10  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be
 come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

NUM 35:11  Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you;
 that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.

NUM 35:12  And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that
 the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.

NUM 35:13  And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for
 refuge.

NUM 35:14  Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities
 shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.

NUM 35:15  These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of
 Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every
 one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.

NUM 35:16  And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he
 is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.

NUM 35:17  And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and
 he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.

NUM 35:18  Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may
 die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.

NUM 35:19  The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he
 meeteth him, he shall slay him.

NUM 35:20  But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait,
 that he die;

NUM 35:21  Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him
 shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood
 shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.

NUM 35:22  But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him
 any thing without laying of wait,

NUM 35:23  Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast
 it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:

NUM 35:24  Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the
 revenger of blood according to these judgments:

NUM 35:25  And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the
 revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his
 refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the
 high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.

NUM 35:26  But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the
 city of his refuge, whither he was fled;

NUM 35:27  And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city
 of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be
 guilty of blood:

NUM 35:28  Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the
 death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer
 shall return into the land of his possession.

NUM 35:29  So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you
 throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

NUM 35:30  Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the
 mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to
 cause him to die.

NUM 35:31  Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer,
 which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.

NUM 35:32  And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city
 of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the
 death of the priest.

NUM 35:33  So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it
 defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed
 therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.

NUM 35:34  Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I
 dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

NUM 36:1  And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the
 son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph,
 came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers
 of the children of Israel:

NUM 36:2  And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an
 inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by
 the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his
 daughters.

NUM 36:3  And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the
 children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the
 inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe
 whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our
 inheritance.

NUM 36:4  And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall
 their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are
 received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance
 of the tribe of our fathers.

NUM 36:5  And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word
 of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.

NUM 36:6  This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the
 daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only
 to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.

NUM 36:7  So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from
 tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself
 to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

NUM 36:8  And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe
 of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe
 of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the
 inheritance of his fathers.

NUM 36:9  Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe;
 but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to
 his own inheritance.

NUM 36:10  Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
 Zelophehad:

NUM 36:11  For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters
 of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:

NUM 36:12  And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the
 son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family
 of their father.

NUM 36:13  These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD
 commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of
 Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

RTH 1:1  Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was
 a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn
 in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.

RTH 1:2  And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife
 Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of
 Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.

RTH 1:3  And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two
 sons.

RTH 1:4  And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was
 Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten
 years.

RTH 1:5  And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left
 of her two sons and her husband.

RTH 1:6  Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from
 the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the
 LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.

RTH 1:7  Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two
 daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land
 of Judah.

RTH 1:8  And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her
 mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the
 dead, and with me.

RTH 1:9  The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of
 her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.

RTH 1:10  And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy
 people.

RTH 1:11  And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are
 there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?

RTH 1:12  Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an
 husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to
 night, and should also bear sons;

RTH 1:13  Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them
 from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your
 sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.

RTH 1:14  And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her
 mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

RTH 1:15  And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
 people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.

RTH 1:16  And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
 following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou
 lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:

RTH 1:17  Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do
 so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.

RTH 1:18  When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she
 left speaking unto her.

RTH 1:19  So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass,
 when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and
 they said, Is this Naomi?

RTH 1:20  And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the
 Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

RTH 1:21  I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why
 then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the
 Almighty hath afflicted me?

RTH 1:22  So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with
 her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem
 in the beginning of barley harvest.

RTH 2:1  And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth,
 of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

RTH 2:2  And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
 field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace.
 And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

RTH 2:3  And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers:
 and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was
 of the kindred of Elimelech.

RTH 2:4  And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The
 LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.

RTH 2:5  Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose
 damsel is this?

RTH 2:6  And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is
 the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:

RTH 2:7  And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers
 among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning
 until now, that she tarried a little in the house.

RTH 2:8  Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to
 glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my
 maidens:

RTH 2:9  Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after
 them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and
 when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young
 men have drawn.

RTH 2:10  Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said
 unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take
 knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?

RTH 2:11  And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me,
 all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine
 husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of
 thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.

RTH 2:12  The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the
 LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.

RTH 2:13  Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that
 thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine
 handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.

RTH 2:14  And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the
 bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and
 he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.

RTH 2:15  And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,
 saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:

RTH 2:16  And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave
 them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

RTH 2:17  So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had
 gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.

RTH 2:18  And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw
 what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had
 reserved after she was sufficed.

RTH 2:19  And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day?
 and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And
 she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's
 name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.

RTH 2:20  And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD,
 who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi
 said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.

RTH 2:21  And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep
 fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.

RTH 2:22  And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
 daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any
 other field.

RTH 2:23  So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of
 barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.

RTH 3:1  Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not
 seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?

RTH 3:2  And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?
 Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.

RTH 3:3  Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon
 thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the
 man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.

RTH 3:4  And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place
 where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee
 down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.

RTH 3:5  And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

RTH 3:6  And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her
 mother in law bade her.

RTH 3:7  And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to
 lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered
 his feet, and laid her down.

RTH 3:8  And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned
 himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.

RTH 3:9  And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid:
 spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.

RTH 3:10  And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast
 shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as
 thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.

RTH 3:11  And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou
 requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous
 woman.

RTH 3:12  And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a
 kinsman nearer than I.

RTH 3:13  Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will
 perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part:
 but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part
 of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.

RTH 3:14  And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one
 could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into
 the floor.

RTH 3:15  Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it.
 And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her:
 and she went into the city.

RTH 3:16  And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my
 daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.

RTH 3:17  And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to
 me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

RTH 3:18  Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter
 will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing
 this day.

RTH 4:1  Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
 behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a
 one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.

RTH 4:2  And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down
 here. And they sat down.

RTH 4:3  And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the
 country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:

RTH 4:4  And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the
 inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it,
 redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for
 there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I
 will redeem it.

RTH 4:5  Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi,
 thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise
 up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.

RTH 4:6  And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine
 own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.

RTH 4:7  Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming
 and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his
 shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.

RTH 4:8  Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off
 his shoe.

RTH 4:9  And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
 witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that
 was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.

RTH 4:10  Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to
 be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the
 name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of
 his place: ye are witnesses this day.

RTH 4:11  And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We
 are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like
 Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou
 worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:

RTH 4:12  And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto
 Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.

RTH 4:13  So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto
 her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

RTH 4:14  And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not
 left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.

RTH 4:15  And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of
 thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better
 to thee than seven sons, hath born him.

RTH 4:16  And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse
 unto it.

RTH 4:17  And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son
 born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the
 father of David.

RTH 4:18  Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

RTH 4:19  And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,

RTH 4:20  And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

RTH 4:21  And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

RTH 4:22  And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

SA1 1:1  Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and
 his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of
 Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

SA1 1:2  And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name
 of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.

SA1 1:3  And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
 sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni
 and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.

SA1 1:4  And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his
 wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:

SA1 1:5  But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the
 LORD had shut up her womb.

SA1 1:6  And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,
 because the LORD had shut up her womb.

SA1 1:7  And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the
 LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.

SA1 1:8  Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and
 why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee
 than ten sons?

SA1 1:9  So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had
 drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the
 LORD.

SA1 1:10  And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept
 sore.

SA1 1:11  And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed
 look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget
 thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will
 give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor
 come upon his head.

SA1 1:12  And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that
 Eli marked her mouth.

SA1 1:13  Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her
 voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.

SA1 1:14  And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy
 wine from thee.

SA1 1:15  And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
 sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured
 out my soul before the LORD.

SA1 1:16  Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the
 abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.

SA1 1:17  Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant
 thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

SA1 1:18  And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the
 woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.

SA1 1:19  And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the
 LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah
 his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

SA1 1:20  Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah
 had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying,
 Because I have asked him of the LORD.

SA1 1:21  And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the
 LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

SA1 1:22  But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go
 up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear
 before the LORD, and there abide for ever.

SA1 1:23  And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;
 tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the
 woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.

SA1 1:24  And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three
 bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto
 the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.

SA1 1:25  And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

SA1 1:26  And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman
 that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

SA1 1:27  For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which
 I asked of him:

SA1 1:28  Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he
 shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.

SA1 2:1  And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn
 is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I
 rejoice in thy salvation.

SA1 2:2  There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither
 is there any rock like our God.

SA1 2:3  Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your
 mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.

SA1 2:4  The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are
 girded with strength.

SA1 2:5  They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that
 were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath
 many children is waxed feeble.

SA1 2:6  The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and
 bringeth up.

SA1 2:7  The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth
 up.

SA1 2:8  He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from
 the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne
 of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the
 world upon them.

SA1 2:9  He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in
 darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

SA1 2:10  The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven
 shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and
 he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.

SA1 2:11  And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister
 unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

SA1 2:12  Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.

SA1 2:13  And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man
 offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in
 seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;

SA1 2:14  And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all
 that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in
 Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.

SA1 2:15  Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said
 to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will
 not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

SA1 2:16  And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat
 presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer
 him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.

SA1 2:17  Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD:
 for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.

SA1 2:18  But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a
 linen ephod.

SA1 2:19  Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him
 from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly
 sacrifice.

SA1 2:20  And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee
 seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto
 their own home.

SA1 2:21  And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three
 sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.

SA1 2:22  Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
 Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation.

SA1 2:23  And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil
 dealings by all this people.

SA1 2:24  Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the
 LORD's people to transgress.

SA1 2:25  If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a
 man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they
 hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay
 them.

SA1 2:26  And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
 LORD, and also with men.

SA1 2:27  And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith
 the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were
 in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?

SA1 2:28  And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest,
 to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and
 did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the
 children of Israel?

SA1 2:29  Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have
 commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make
 yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?

SA1 2:30  Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy
 house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now
 the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and
 they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

SA1 2:31  Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of
 thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.

SA1 2:32  And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which
 God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for
 ever.

SA1 2:33  And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall
 be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of
 thine house shall die in the flower of their age.

SA1 2:34  And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two
 sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.

SA1 2:35  And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to
 that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure
 house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.

SA1 2:36  And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house
 shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and
 shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may
 eat a piece of bread.

SA1 3:1  And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word
 of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.

SA1 3:2  And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his
 place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;

SA1 3:3  And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the
 ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;

SA1 3:4  That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.

SA1 3:5  And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he
 said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.

SA1 3:6  And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to
 Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called
 not, my son; lie down again.

SA1 3:7  Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD
 yet revealed unto him.

SA1 3:8  And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went
 to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that
 the LORD had called the child.

SA1 3:9  Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he
 call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So
 Samuel went and lay down in his place.

SA1 3:10  And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel,
 Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.

SA1 3:11  And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at
 which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.

SA1 3:12  In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken
 concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.

SA1 3:13  For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the
 iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he
 restrained them not.

SA1 3:14  And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity
 of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.

SA1 3:15  And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house
 of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

SA1 3:16  Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered,
 Here am I.

SA1 3:17  And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I
 pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide
 any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.

SA1 3:18  And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he
 said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.

SA1 3:19  And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his
 words fall to the ground.

SA1 3:20  And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
 established to be a prophet of the LORD.

SA1 3:21  And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself
 to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

SA1 4:1  And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against
 the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines
 pitched in Aphek.

SA1 4:2  And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when
 they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew
 of the army in the field about four thousand men.

SA1 4:3  And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel
 said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let
 us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that,
 when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.

SA1 4:4  So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the
 ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the
 cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the
 ark of the covenant of God.

SA1 4:5  And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all
 Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.

SA1 4:6  And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What
 meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they
 understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.

SA1 4:7  And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the
 camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing
 heretofore.

SA1 4:8  Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
 Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the
 wilderness.

SA1 4:9  Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be
 not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like
 men, and fight.

SA1 4:10  And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled
 every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell
 of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

SA1 4:11  And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
 Phinehas, were slain.

SA1 4:12  And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh
 the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.

SA1 4:13  And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching:
 for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the
 city, and told it, all the city cried out.

SA1 4:14  And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the
 noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.

SA1 4:15  Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that
 he could not see.

SA1 4:16  And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I
 fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?

SA1 4:17  And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the
 Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and
 thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is
 taken.

SA1 4:18  And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he
 fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck
 brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged
 Israel forty years.

SA1 4:19  And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be
 delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and
 that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and
 travailed; for her pains came upon her.

SA1 4:20  And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto
 her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did
 she regard it.

SA1 4:21  And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from
 Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law
 and her husband.

SA1 4:22  And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God
 is taken.

SA1 5:1  And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer
 unto Ashdod.

SA1 5:2  When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the
 house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

SA1 5:3  And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was
 fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took
 Dagon, and set him in his place again.

SA1 5:4  And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was
 fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head
 of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold;
 only the stump of Dagon was left to him.

SA1 5:5  Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's
 house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.

SA1 5:6  But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
 destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts
 thereof.

SA1 5:7  And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark
 of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us,
 and upon Dagon our god.

SA1 5:8  They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto
 them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they
 answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And
 they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.

SA1 5:9  And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the
 LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men
 of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret
 parts.

SA1 5:10  Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as
 the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have
 brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.

SA1 5:11  So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
 Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go
 again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a
 deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy
 there.

SA1 5:12  And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry
 of the city went up to heaven.

SA1 6:1  And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven
 months.

SA1 6:2  And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying,
 What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it
 to his place.

SA1 6:3  And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it
 not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be
 healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.

SA1 6:4  Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall
 return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice,
 according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was
 on you all, and on your lords.

SA1 6:5  Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your
 mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel:
 peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods,
 and from off your land.

SA1 6:6  Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh
 hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they
 not let the people go, and they departed?

SA1 6:7  Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there
 hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home
 from them:

SA1 6:8  And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the
 jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by
 the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.

SA1 6:9  And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
 Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall
 know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to
 us.

SA1 6:10  And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the
 cart, and shut up their calves at home:

SA1 6:11  And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with
 the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.

SA1 6:12  And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and
 went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the
 right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them
 unto the border of Bethshemesh.

SA1 6:13  And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the
 valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see
 it.

SA1 6:14  And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood
 there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the
 cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.

SA1 6:15  And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that
 was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great
 stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed
 sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.

SA1 6:16  And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned
 to Ekron the same day.

SA1 6:17  And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a
 trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon
 one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;

SA1 6:18  And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the
 Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of
 country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down
 the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of
 Joshua, the Bethshemite.

SA1 6:19  And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the
 ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore
 and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many
 of the people with a great slaughter.

SA1 6:20  And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this
 holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

SA1 6:21  And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying,
 The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and
 fetch it up to you.

SA1 7:1  And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the
 LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified
 Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.

SA1 7:2  And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the
 time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented
 after the LORD.

SA1 7:3  And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return
 unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and
 Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve
 him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

SA1 7:4  Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and
 served the LORD only.

SA1 7:5  And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you
 unto the LORD.

SA1 7:6  And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it
 out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned
 against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.

SA1 7:7  And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
 gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against
 Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the
 Philistines.

SA1 7:8  And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the
 LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.

SA1 7:9  And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering
 wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD
 heard him.

SA1 7:10  And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines
 drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great
 thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were
 smitten before Israel.

SA1 7:11  And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
 Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.

SA1 7:12  Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and
 called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.

SA1 7:13  So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast
 of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days
 of Samuel.

SA1 7:14  And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
 restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did
 Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace
 between Israel and the Amorites.

SA1 7:15  And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

SA1 7:16  And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and
 Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

SA1 7:17  And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he
 judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.

SA1 8:1  And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges
 over Israel.

SA1 8:2  Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second,
 Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

SA1 8:3  And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and
 took bribes, and perverted judgment.

SA1 8:4  Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came
 to Samuel unto Ramah,

SA1 8:5  And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy
 ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.

SA1 8:6  But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to
 judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

SA1 8:7  And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in
 all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have
 rejected me, that I should not reign over them.

SA1 8:8  According to all the works which they have done since the day that I
 brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken
 me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

SA1 8:9  Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly
 unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.

SA1 8:10  And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked
 of him a king.

SA1 8:11  And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign
 over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his
 chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.

SA1 8:12  And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over
 fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to
 make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.

SA1 8:13  And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be
 cooks, and to be bakers.

SA1 8:14  And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
 oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.

SA1 8:15  And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and
 give to his officers, and to his servants.

SA1 8:16  And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your
 goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.

SA1 8:17  He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.

SA1 8:18  And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall
 have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.

SA1 8:19  Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they
 said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;

SA1 8:20  That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge
 us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

SA1 8:21  And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them
 in the ears of the LORD.

SA1 8:22  And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them
 a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his
 city.

SA1 9:1  Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of
 Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a
 Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

SA1 9:2  And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a
 goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than
 he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.

SA1 9:3  And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul
 his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the
 asses.

SA1 9:4  And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of
 Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of
 Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the
 Benjamites, but they found them not.

SA1 9:5  And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant
 that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for
 the asses, and take thought for us.

SA1 9:6  And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of
 God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass:
 now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.

SA1 9:7  Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we
 bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a
 present to bring to the man of God: what have we?

SA1 9:8  And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at
 hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of
 God, to tell us our way.

SA1 9:9  (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he
 spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet
 was beforetime called a Seer.)

SA1 9:10  Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they
 went unto the city where the man of God was.

SA1 9:11  And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens
 going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?

SA1 9:12  And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you:
 make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice
 of the people to day in the high place:

SA1 9:13  As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him,
 before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until
 he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be
 bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

SA1 9:14  And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the
 city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.

SA1 9:15  Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came,
 saying,

SA1 9:16  To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of
 Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that
 he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked
 upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.

SA1 9:17  And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom
 I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.

SA1 9:18  Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray
 thee, where the seer's house is.

SA1 9:19  And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me
 unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will
 let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.

SA1 9:20  And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy
 mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is
 it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?

SA1 9:21  And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest
 of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the
 tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?

SA1 9:22  And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the
 parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden,
 which were about thirty persons.

SA1 9:23  And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee,
 of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

SA1 9:24  And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and
 set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before
 thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I
 have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

SA1 9:25  And when they were come down from the high place into the city,
 Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

SA1 9:26  And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the
 day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may
 send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and
 Samuel, abroad.

SA1 9:27  And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to
 Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou
 still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

SA1 10:1  Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and
 kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be
 captain over his inheritance?

SA1 10:2  When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men
 by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say
 unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy
 father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What
 shall I do for my son?

SA1 10:3  Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the
 plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to
 Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of
 bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:

SA1 10:4  And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which
 thou shalt receive of their hands.

SA1 10:5  After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison
 of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither
 to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the
 high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before
 them; and they shall prophesy:

SA1 10:6  And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt
 prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

SA1 10:7  And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as
 occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.

SA1 10:8  And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come
 down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of
 peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew
 thee what thou shalt do.

SA1 10:9  And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel,
 God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.

SA1 10:10  And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
 prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied
 among them.

SA1 10:11  And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that,
 behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to
 another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among
 the prophets?

SA1 10:12  And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their
 father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?

SA1 10:13  And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high
 place.

SA1 10:14  And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye?
 And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we
 came to Samuel.

SA1 10:15  And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto
 you.

SA1 10:16  And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were
 found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him
 not.

SA1 10:17  And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;

SA1 10:18  And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of
 Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand
 of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that
 oppressed you:

SA1 10:19  And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of
 all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay,
 but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by
 your tribes, and by your thousands.

SA1 10:20  And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
 near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

SA1 10:21  When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
 families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken:
 and when they sought him, he could not be found.

SA1 10:22  Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet
 come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the
 stuff.

SA1 10:23  And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the
 people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.

SA1 10:24  And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath
 chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people
 shouted, and said, God save the king.

SA1 10:25  Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it
 in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people
 away, every man to his house.

SA1 10:26  And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of
 men, whose hearts God had touched.

SA1 10:27  But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And
 they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.

SA1 11:1  Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead:
 and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we
 will serve thee.

SA1 11:2  And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make
 a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it
 for a reproach upon all Israel.

SA1 11:3  And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite,
 that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there
 be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.

SA1 11:4  Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings
 in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and
 wept.

SA1 11:5  And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul
 said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings
 of the men of Jabesh.

SA1 11:6  And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and
 his anger was kindled greatly.

SA1 11:7  And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them
 throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying,
 Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done
 unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out
 with one consent.

SA1 11:8  And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three
 hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.

SA1 11:9  And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto
 the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall
 have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and
 they were glad.

SA1 11:10  Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto
 you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.

SA1 11:11  And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
 companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and
 slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they
 which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.

SA1 11:12  And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul
 reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.

SA1 11:13  And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for
 to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

SA1 11:14  Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and
 renew the kingdom there.

SA1 11:15  And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king
 before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace
 offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced
 greatly.

SA1 12:1  And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your
 voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.

SA1 12:2  And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
 grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you
 from my childhood unto this day.

SA1 12:3  Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his
 anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I
 defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe
 to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.

SA1 12:4  And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither
 hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

SA1 12:5  And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his
 anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And
 they answered, He is witness.

SA1 12:6  And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses
 and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.

SA1 12:7  Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD
 of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your
 fathers.

SA1 12:8  When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the
 LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers
 out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.

SA1 12:9  And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand
 of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the
 Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against
 them.

SA1 12:10  And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we
 have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver
 us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.

SA1 12:11  And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
 Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and
 ye dwelled safe.

SA1 12:12  And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came
 against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the
 LORD your God was your king.

SA1 12:13  Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have
 desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.

SA1 12:14  If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not
 rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the
 king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:

SA1 12:15  But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the
 commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as
 it was against your fathers.

SA1 12:16  Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do
 before your eyes.

SA1 12:17  Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he
 shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your
 wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking
 you a king.

SA1 12:18  So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain
 that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.

SA1 12:19  And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the
 LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil,
 to ask us a king.

SA1 12:20  And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this
 wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD
 with all your heart;

SA1 12:21  And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things,
 which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.

SA1 12:22  For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake:
 because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.

SA1 12:23  Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in
 ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:

SA1 12:24  Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for
 consider how great things he hath done for you.

SA1 12:25  But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and
 your king.

SA1 13:1  Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,

SA1 13:2  Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand
 were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with
 Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man
 to his tent.

SA1 13:3  And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
 Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout
 all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

SA1 13:4  And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the
 Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the
 Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.

SA1 13:5  And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
 Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as
 the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and
 pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.

SA1 13:6  When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the
 people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in
 thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.

SA1 13:7  And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and
 Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him
 trembling.

SA1 13:8  And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had
 appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from
 him.

SA1 13:9  And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
 offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

SA1 13:10  And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering
 the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that
 he might salute him.

SA1 13:11  And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw
 that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the
 days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at
 Michmash;

SA1 13:12  Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to
 Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself
 therefore, and offered a burnt offering.

SA1 13:13  And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not
 kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now
 would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.

SA1 13:14  But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a
 man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over
 his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.

SA1 13:15  And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
 Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six
 hundred men.

SA1 13:16  And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present
 with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in
 Michmash.

SA1 13:17  And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three
 companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the
 land of Shual:

SA1 13:18  And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company
 turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward
 the wilderness.

SA1 13:19  Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for
 the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:

SA1 13:20  But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
 every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.

SA1 13:21  Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for
 the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

SA1 13:22  So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither
 sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul
 and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.

SA1 13:23  And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
 Michmash.

SA1 14:1  Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said
 unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the
 Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.

SA1 14:2  And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate
 tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six
 hundred men;

SA1 14:3  And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas,
 the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people
 knew not that Jonathan was gone.

SA1 14:4  And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto
 the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a
 sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name
 of the other Seneh.

SA1 14:5  The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
 Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.

SA1 14:6  And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and
 let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the
 LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many
 or by few.

SA1 14:7  And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart:
 turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.

SA1 14:8  Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we
 will discover ourselves unto them.

SA1 14:9  If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will
 stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

SA1 14:10  But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the
 LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.

SA1 14:11  And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
 Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out
 of the holes where they had hid themselves.

SA1 14:12  And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
 armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And
 Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath
 delivered them into the hand of Israel.

SA1 14:13  And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his
 armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer
 slew after him.

SA1 14:14  And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made,
 was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of
 oxen might plow.

SA1 14:15  And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the
 people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth
 quaked: so it was a very great trembling.

SA1 14:16  And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
 behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.

SA1 14:17  Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and
 see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his
 armourbearer were not there.

SA1 14:18  And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark
 of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

SA1 14:19  And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the
 noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul
 said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

SA1 14:20  And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves,
 and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his
 fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.

SA1 14:21  Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that
 time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about,
 even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and
 Jonathan.

SA1 14:22  Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount
 Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed
 hard after them in the battle.

SA1 14:23  So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto
 Bethaven.

SA1 14:24  And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured
 the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening,
 that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.

SA1 14:25  And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon
 the ground.

SA1 14:26  And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
 dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the
 oath.

SA1 14:27  But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the
 oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and
 dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were
 enlightened.

SA1 14:28  Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
 charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any
 food this day. And the people were faint.

SA1 14:29  Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray
 you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this
 honey.

SA1 14:30  How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the
 spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much
 greater slaughter among the Philistines?

SA1 14:31  And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon:
 and the people were very faint.

SA1 14:32  And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and
 calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the
 blood.

SA1 14:33  Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the
 LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed:
 roll a great stone unto me this day.

SA1 14:34  And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto
 them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay
 them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.
 And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew
 them there.

SA1 14:35  And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar
 that he built unto the LORD.

SA1 14:36  And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and
 spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And
 they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us
 draw near hither unto God.

SA1 14:37  And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
 Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered
 him not that day.

SA1 14:38  And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and
 know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

SA1 14:39  For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
 Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the
 people that answered him.

SA1 14:40  Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan
 my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what
 seemeth good unto thee.

SA1 14:41  Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot.
 And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.

SA1 14:42  And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
 Jonathan was taken.

SA1 14:43  Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
 Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end
 of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.

SA1 14:44  And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely
 die, Jonathan.

SA1 14:45  And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought
 this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall
 not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God
 this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

SA1 14:46  Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
 Philistines went to their own place.

SA1 14:47  So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his
 enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and
 against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines:
 and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.

SA1 14:48  And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered
 Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

SA1 14:49  Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and
 the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn
 Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

SA1 14:50  And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz:
 and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's
 uncle.

SA1 14:51  And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the
 son of Abiel.

SA1 14:52  And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul:
 and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.

SA1 15:1  Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be
 king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice
 of the words of the LORD.

SA1 15:2  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to
 Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.

SA1 15:3  Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and
 spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and
 sheep, camel and ass.

SA1 15:4  And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim,
 two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.

SA1 15:5  And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.

SA1 15:6  And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among
 the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all
 the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites
 departed from among the Amalekites.

SA1 15:7  And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur,
 that is over against Egypt.

SA1 15:8  And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
 destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

SA1 15:9  But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and
 of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and
 would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse,
 that they destroyed utterly.

SA1 15:10  Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,

SA1 15:11  It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned
 back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it
 grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.

SA1 15:12  And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told
 Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and
 is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.

SA1 15:13  And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou
 of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.

SA1 15:14  And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in
 mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

SA1 15:15  And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the
 people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the
 LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.

SA1 15:16  Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD
 hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.

SA1 15:17  And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou
 not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king
 over Israel?

SA1 15:18  And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly
 destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be
 consumed.

SA1 15:19  Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst
 fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?

SA1 15:20  And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
 LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the
 king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

SA1 15:21  But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the
 things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD
 thy God in Gilgal.

SA1 15:22  And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings
 and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is
 better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

SA1 15:23  For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
 iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he
 hath also rejected thee from being king.

SA1 15:24  And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed
 the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and
 obeyed their voice.

SA1 15:25  Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me,
 that I may worship the LORD.

SA1 15:26  And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou
 hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from
 being king over Israel.

SA1 15:27  And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt
 of his mantle, and it rent.

SA1 15:28  And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel
 from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better
 than thou.

SA1 15:29  And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is
 not a man, that he should repent.

SA1 15:30  Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before
 the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I
 may worship the LORD thy God.

SA1 15:31  So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.

SA1 15:32  Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
 Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the
 bitterness of death is past.

SA1 15:33  And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so shall
 thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before
 the LORD in Gilgal.

SA1 15:34  Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah
 of Saul.

SA1 15:35  And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:
 nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made
 Saul king over Israel.

SA1 16:1  And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
 seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with
 oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided
 me a king among his sons.

SA1 16:2  And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And
 the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice
 to the LORD.

SA1 16:3  And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt
 do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.

SA1 16:4  And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And
 the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou
 peaceably?

SA1 16:5  And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:
 sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified
 Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.

SA1 16:6  And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
 Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.

SA1 16:7  But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the
 height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as
 man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on
 the heart.

SA1 16:8  Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he
 said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

SA1 16:9  Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the
 LORD chosen this.

SA1 16:10  Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
 Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

SA1 16:11  And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said,
 There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And
 Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he
 come hither.

SA1 16:12  And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a
 beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise,
 anoint him: for this is he.

SA1 16:13  Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of
 his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day
 forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.

SA1 16:14  But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit
 from the LORD troubled him.

SA1 16:15  And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from
 God troubleth thee.

SA1 16:16  Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to
 seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to
 pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his
 hand, and thou shalt be well.

SA1 16:17  And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play
 well, and bring him to me.

SA1 16:18  Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a
 son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty
 valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely
 person, and the LORD is with him.

SA1 16:19  Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David
 thy son, which is with the sheep.

SA1 16:20  And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a
 kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.

SA1 16:21  And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
 greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

SA1 16:22  And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before
 me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

SA1 16:23  And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul,
 that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and
 was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

SA1 17:1  Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and
 were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched
 between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

SA1 17:2  And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by
 the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.

SA1 17:3  And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel
 stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.

SA1 17:4  And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
 named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.

SA1 17:5  And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a
 coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.

SA1 17:6  And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass
 between his shoulders.

SA1 17:7  And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's
 head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went
 before him.

SA1 17:8  And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them,
 Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and
 ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.

SA1 17:9  If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your
 servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our
 servants, and serve us.

SA1 17:10  And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give
 me a man, that we may fight together.

SA1 17:11  When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they
 were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

SA1 17:12  Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose
 name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old
 man in the days of Saul.

SA1 17:13  And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the
 battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab
 the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.

SA1 17:14  And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.

SA1 17:15  But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at
 Bethlehem.

SA1 17:16  And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
 himself forty days.

SA1 17:17  And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an
 ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of thy
 brethren;

SA1 17:18  And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and
 look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.

SA1 17:19  Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of
 Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

SA1 17:20  And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a
 keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the
 trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.

SA1 17:21  For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army
 against army.

SA1 17:22  And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
 carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.

SA1 17:23  And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the
 Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the
 Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.

SA1 17:24  And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and
 were sore afraid.

SA1 17:25  And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up?
 surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who
 killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him
 his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.

SA1 17:26  And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be
 done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach
 from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy
 the armies of the living God?

SA1 17:27  And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it
 be done to the man that killeth him.

SA1 17:28  And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and
 Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down
 hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I
 know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down
 that thou mightest see the battle.

SA1 17:29  And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

SA1 17:30  And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same
 manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.

SA1 17:31  And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them
 before Saul: and he sent for him.

SA1 17:32  And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy
 servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

SA1 17:33  And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
 Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war
 from his youth.

SA1 17:34  And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and
 there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:

SA1 17:35  And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his
 mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote
 him, and slew him.

SA1 17:36  Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised
 Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the
 living God.

SA1 17:37  David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
 of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the
 hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with
 thee.

SA1 17:38  And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass
 upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

SA1 17:39  And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go;
 for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these;
 for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.

SA1 17:40  And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones
 out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a
 scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.

SA1 17:41  And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man
 that bare the shield went before him.

SA1 17:42  And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained
 him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.

SA1 17:43  And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to
 me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.

SA1 17:44  And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy
 flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.

SA1 17:45  Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
 sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name
 of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.

SA1 17:46  This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite
 thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host
 of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts
 of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

SA1 17:47  And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword
 and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.

SA1 17:48  And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew
 nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the
 Philistine.

SA1 17:49  And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and
 slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into
 his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.

SA1 17:50  So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
 stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the
 hand of David.

SA1 17:51  Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his
 sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his
 head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they
 fled.

SA1 17:52  And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued
 the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron.
 And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even
 unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

SA1 17:53  And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
 Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

SA1 17:54  And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
 Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

SA1 17:55  And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said
 unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And
 Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.

SA1 17:56  And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

SA1 17:57  And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner
 took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his
 hand.

SA1 17:58  And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David
 answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

SA1 18:1  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul,
 that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved
 him as his own soul.

SA1 18:2  And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his
 father's house.

SA1 18:3  Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his
 own soul.

SA1 18:4  And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave
 it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his
 girdle.

SA1 18:5  And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself
 wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the
 sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.

SA1 18:6  And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the
 slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel,
 singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with
 instruments of musick.

SA1 18:7  And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul
 hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.

SA1 18:8  And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said,
 They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but
 thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?

SA1 18:9  And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

SA1 18:10  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God
 came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played
 with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.

SA1 18:11  And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even
 to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.

SA1 18:12  And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was
 departed from Saul.

SA1 18:13  Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a
 thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.

SA1 18:14  And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was
 with him.

SA1 18:15  Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was
 afraid of him.

SA1 18:16  But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came
 in before them.

SA1 18:17  And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I
 give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles.
 For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the
 Philistines be upon him.

SA1 18:18  And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
 father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?

SA1 18:19  But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should
 have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to
 wife.

SA1 18:20  And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the
 thing pleased him.

SA1 18:21  And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
 him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul
 said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.

SA1 18:22  And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
 secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his
 servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.

SA1 18:23  And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And
 David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing
 that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?

SA1 18:24  And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake
 David.

SA1 18:25  And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any
 dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the
 king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the
 Philistines.

SA1 18:26  And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well
 to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.

SA1 18:27  Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the
 Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave
 them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And
 Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.

SA1 18:28  And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal
 Saul's daughter loved him.

SA1 18:29  And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's
 enemy continually.

SA1 18:30  Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass,
 after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the
 servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.

SA1 19:1  And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that
 they should kill David.

SA1 19:2  But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told
 David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray
 thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret
 place, and hide thyself:

SA1 19:3  And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou
 art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will
 tell thee.

SA1 19:4  And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto
 him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath
 not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very
 good:

SA1 19:5  For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the
 LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst
 rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David
 without a cause?

SA1 19:6  And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the
 LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

SA1 19:7  And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things.
 And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times
 past.

SA1 19:8  And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the
 Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.

SA1 19:9  And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his
 house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.

SA1 19:10  And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin:
 but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the
 wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.

SA1 19:11  Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to
 slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou
 save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.

SA1 19:12  So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
 fled, and escaped.

SA1 19:13  And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow
 of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.

SA1 19:14  And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.

SA1 19:15  And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him
 up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

SA1 19:16  And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image
 in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.

SA1 19:17  And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent
 away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto
 me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?

SA1 19:18  So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told
 him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in
 Naioth.

SA1 19:19  And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.

SA1 19:20  And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
 company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over
 them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also
 prophesied.

SA1 19:21  And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
 prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they
 prophesied also.

SA1 19:22  Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in
 Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said,
 Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

SA1 19:23  And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was
 upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in
 Ramah.

SA1 19:24  And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel
 in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore
 they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

SA1 20:1  And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
 Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before
 thy father, that he seeketh my life?

SA1 20:2  And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my
 father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me:
 and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.

SA1 20:3  And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that
 I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this,
 lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
 liveth, there is but a step between me and death.

SA1 20:4  Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will
 even do it for thee.

SA1 20:5  And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and
 I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may
 hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.

SA1 20:6  If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave
 of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly
 sacrifice there for all the family.

SA1 20:7  If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he
 be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.

SA1 20:8  Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast
 brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding,
 if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me
 to thy father?

SA1 20:9  And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that
 evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it
 thee?

SA1 20:10  Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy
 father answer thee roughly?

SA1 20:11  And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the
 field. And they went out both of them into the field.

SA1 20:12  And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have
 sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if
 there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

SA1 20:13  The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father
 to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou
 mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my
 father.

SA1 20:14  And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the
 LORD, that I die not:

SA1 20:15  But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever:
 no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the
 face of the earth.

SA1 20:16  So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the
 LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.

SA1 20:17  And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for
 he loved him as he loved his own soul.

SA1 20:18  Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou
 shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

SA1 20:19  And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
 quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the
 business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.

SA1 20:20  And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot
 at a mark.

SA1 20:21  And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If
 I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee,
 take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the
 LORD liveth.

SA1 20:22  But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond
 thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.

SA1 20:23  And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
 behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.

SA1 20:24  So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
 come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

SA1 20:25  And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat
 by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's
 place was empty.

SA1 20:26  Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,
 Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.

SA1 20:27  And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the
 month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son,
 Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?

SA1 20:28  And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go
 to Bethlehem:

SA1 20:29  And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice
 in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I
 have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my
 brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.

SA1 20:30  Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto
 him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast
 chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy
 mother's nakedness?

SA1 20:31  For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt
 not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto
 me, for he shall surely die.

SA1 20:32  And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore
 shall he be slain? what hath he done?

SA1 20:33  And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew
 that it was determined of his father to slay David.

SA1 20:34  So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no
 meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his
 father had done him shame.

SA1 20:35  And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the
 field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.

SA1 20:36  And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
 shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

SA1 20:37  And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan
 had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond
 thee?

SA1 20:38  And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And
 Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.

SA1 20:39  But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the
 matter.

SA1 20:40  And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go,
 carry them to the city.

SA1 20:41  And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward
 the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times:
 and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.

SA1 20:42  And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn
 both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and
 thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed:
 and Jonathan went into the city.

SA1 21:1  Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was
 afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no
 man with thee?

SA1 21:2  And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me
 a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business
 whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed
 my servants to such and such a place.

SA1 21:3  Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread
 in mine hand, or what there is present.

SA1 21:4  And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread
 under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept
 themselves at least from women.

SA1 21:5  And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women
 have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the
 vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea,
 though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.

SA1 21:6  So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there
 but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread
 in the day when it was taken away.

SA1 21:7  Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
 detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest
 of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

SA1 21:8  And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand
 spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me,
 because the king's business required haste.

SA1 21:9  And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou
 slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind
 the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that
 here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.

SA1 21:10  And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to
 Achish the king of Gath.

SA1 21:11  And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king
 of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul
 hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

SA1 21:12  And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of
 Achish the king of Gath.

SA1 21:13  And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad
 in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle
 fall down upon his beard.

SA1 21:14  Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
 wherefore then have ye brought him to me?

SA1 21:15  Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the
 mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?

SA1 22:1  David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and
 when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither
 to him.

SA1 22:2  And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
 debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and
 he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred
 men.

SA1 22:3  And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of
 Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you,
 till I know what God will do for me.

SA1 22:4  And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him
 all the while that David was in the hold.

SA1 22:5  And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
 depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came
 into the forest of Hareth.

SA1 22:6  When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with
 him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his
 hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)

SA1 22:7  Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye
 Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards,
 and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;

SA1 22:8  That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that
 sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is
 none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred
 up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

SA1 22:9  Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of
 Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of
 Ahitub.

SA1 22:10  And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave
 him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

SA1 22:11  Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
 Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they
 came all of them to the king.

SA1 22:12  And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I
 am, my lord.

SA1 22:13  And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and
 the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast
 enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as
 at this day?

SA1 22:14  Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful
 among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at
 thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?

SA1 22:15  Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let
 not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my
 father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.

SA1 22:16  And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all
 thy father's house.

SA1 22:17  And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and
 slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and
 because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants
 of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the
 LORD.

SA1 22:18  And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And
 Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day
 fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.

SA1 22:19  And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the
 sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and
 sheep, with the edge of the sword.

SA1 22:20  And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar,
 escaped, and fled after David.

SA1 22:21  And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.

SA1 22:22  And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the
 Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the
 death of all the persons of thy father's house.

SA1 22:23  Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh
 thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

SA1 23:1  Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against
 Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

SA1 23:2  Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite
 these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the
 Philistines, and save Keilah.

SA1 23:3  And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah:
 how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the
 Philistines?

SA1 23:4  Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him
 and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into
 thine hand.

SA1 23:5  So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
 Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great
 slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

SA1 23:6  And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David
 to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.

SA1 23:7  And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said,
 God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a
 town that hath gates and bars.

SA1 23:8  And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah,
 to besiege David and his men.

SA1 23:9  And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and
 he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.

SA1 23:10  Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly
 heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.

SA1 23:11  Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come
 down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell
 thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.

SA1 23:12  Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into
 the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.

SA1 23:13  Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and
 departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told
 Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.

SA1 23:14  And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a
 mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God
 delivered him not into his hand.

SA1 23:15  And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was
 in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

SA1 23:16  And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and
 strengthened his hand in God.

SA1 23:17  And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall
 not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto
 thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

SA1 23:18  And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the
 wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

SA1 23:19  Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David
 hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah,
 which is on the south of Jeshimon?

SA1 23:20  Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy
 soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.

SA1 23:21  And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on
 me.

SA1 23:22  Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his
 haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very
 subtilly.

SA1 23:23  See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he
 hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go
 with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search
 him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.

SA1 23:24  And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men
 were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.

SA1 23:25  Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
 wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And
 when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.

SA1 23:26  And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on
 that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul;
 for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.

SA1 23:27  But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come;
 for the Philistines have invaded the land.

SA1 23:28  Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against
 the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.

SA1 23:29  And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.

SA1 24:1  And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
 Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness
 of Engedi.

SA1 24:2  Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went
 to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.

SA1 24:3  And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul
 went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the
 cave.

SA1 24:4  And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD
 said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou
 mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut
 off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.

SA1 24:5  And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because
 he had cut off Saul's skirt.

SA1 24:6  And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing
 unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him,
 seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.

SA1 24:7  So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not
 to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.

SA1 24:8  David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after
 Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David
 stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.

SA1 24:9  And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying,
 Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

SA1 24:10  Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had
 delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee:
 but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against
 my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.

SA1 24:11  Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand:
 for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou
 and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have
 not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.

SA1 24:12  The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee:
 but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

SA1 24:13  As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the
 wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

SA1 24:14  After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou
 pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

SA1 24:15  The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and
 see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

SA1 24:16  And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these
 words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul
 lifted up his voice, and wept.

SA1 24:17  And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast
 rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

SA1 24:18  And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me:
 forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me
 not.

SA1 24:19  For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore
 the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.

SA1 24:20  And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and
 that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.

SA1 24:21  Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off
 my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's
 house.

SA1 24:22  And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men
 gat them up unto the hold.

SA1 25:1  And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and
 lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went
 down to the wilderness of Paran.

SA1 25:2  And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and
 the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand
 goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

SA1 25:3  Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail:
 and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance:
 but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of
 Caleb.

SA1 25:4  And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.

SA1 25:5  And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men,
 Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:

SA1 25:6  And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both
 to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.

SA1 25:7  And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which
 were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them,
 all the while they were in Carmel.

SA1 25:8  Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young
 men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee,
 whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.

SA1 25:9  And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all
 those words in the name of David, and ceased.

SA1 25:10  And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who
 is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every
 man from his master.

SA1 25:11  Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have
 killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?

SA1 25:12  So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and
 told him all those sayings.

SA1 25:13  And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And
 they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and
 there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by
 the stuff.

SA1 25:14  But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold,
 David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he
 railed on them.

SA1 25:15  But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither
 missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were
 in the fields:

SA1 25:16  They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we
 were with them keeping the sheep.

SA1 25:17  Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
 determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such
 a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.

SA1 25:18  Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
 bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched
 corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and
 laid them on asses.

SA1 25:19  And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come
 after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

SA1 25:20  And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the
 covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and
 she met them.

SA1 25:21  Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow
 hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto
 him: and he hath requited me evil for good.

SA1 25:22  So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all
 that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

SA1 25:23  And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and
 fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,

SA1 25:24  And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this
 iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine
 audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

SA1 25:25  Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal:
 for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I
 thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.

SA1 25:26  Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth,
 seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from
 avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that
 seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.

SA1 25:27  And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my
 lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.

SA1 25:28  I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD
 will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the
 battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.

SA1 25:29  Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the
 soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God;
 and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle
 of a sling.

SA1 25:30  And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord
 according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have
 appointed thee ruler over Israel;

SA1 25:31  That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my
 lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath
 avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then
 remember thine handmaid.

SA1 25:32  And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which
 sent thee this day to meet me:

SA1 25:33  And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me
 this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own
 hand.

SA1 25:34  For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept
 me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me,
 surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that
 pisseth against the wall.

SA1 25:35  So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and
 said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy
 voice, and have accepted thy person.

SA1 25:36  And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
 house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for
 he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the
 morning light.

SA1 25:37  But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of
 Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within
 him, and he became as a stone.

SA1 25:38  And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal,
 that he died.

SA1 25:39  And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the
 LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and
 hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of
 Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take
 her to him to wife.

SA1 25:40  And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they
 spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.

SA1 25:41  And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said,
 Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of
 my lord.

SA1 25:42  And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
 damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of
 David, and became his wife.

SA1 25:43  David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them
 his wives.

SA1 25:44  But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the
 son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

SA1 26:1  And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David
 hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?

SA1 26:2  Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having
 three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness
 of Ziph.

SA1 26:3  And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon,
 by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came
 after him into the wilderness.

SA1 26:4  David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in
 very deed.

SA1 26:5  And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and
 David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain
 of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about
 him.

SA1 26:6  Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai
 the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul
 to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.

SA1 26:7  So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul
 lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his
 bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.

SA1 26:8  Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine
 hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear
 even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.

SA1 26:9  And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth
 his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?

SA1 26:10  David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite
 him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and
 perish.

SA1 26:11  The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the
 LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his
 bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

SA1 26:12  So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster;
 and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for
 they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon
 them.

SA1 26:13  Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an
 hill afar off; a great space being between them:

SA1 26:14  And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying,
 Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that
 criest to the king?

SA1 26:15  And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like
 to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for
 there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.

SA1 26:16  This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye
 are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed.
 And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his
 bolster.

SA1 26:17  And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son
 David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

SA1 26:18  And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?
 for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?

SA1 26:19  Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of
 his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an
 offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD;
 for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the
 LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.

SA1 26:20  Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face
 of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one
 doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

SA1 26:21  Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no
 more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day:
 behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.

SA1 26:22  And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one
 of the young men come over and fetch it.

SA1 26:23  The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness;
 for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch
 forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.

SA1 26:24  And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so
 let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me
 out of all tribulation.

SA1 26:25  Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt
 both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his
 way, and Saul returned to his place.

SA1 27:1  And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand
 of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape
 into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me
 any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.

SA1 27:2  And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that
 were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.

SA1 27:3  And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with
 his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and
 Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

SA1 27:4  And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no
 more again for him.

SA1 27:5  And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes,
 let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there:
 for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?

SA1 27:6  Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth
 unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

SA1 27:7  And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a
 full year and four months.

SA1 27:8  And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the
 Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants
 of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.

SA1 27:9  And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and
 took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the
 apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.

SA1 27:10  And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said,
 Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and
 against the south of the Kenites.

SA1 27:11  And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to
 Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will
 be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.

SA1 27:12  And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel
 utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.

SA1 28:1  And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered
 their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto
 David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou
 and thy men.

SA1 28:2  And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can
 do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head
 for ever.

SA1 28:3  Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him
 in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar
 spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.

SA1 28:4  And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
 pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in
 Gilboa.

SA1 28:5  And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his
 heart greatly trembled.

SA1 28:6  And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
 neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

SA1 28:7  Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
 familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants
 said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.

SA1 28:8  And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
 went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said,
 I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom
 I shall name unto thee.

SA1 28:9  And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath
 done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards,
 out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me
 to die?

SA1 28:10  And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there
 shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

SA1 28:11  Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said,
 Bring me up Samuel.

SA1 28:12  And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the
 woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.

SA1 28:13  And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And
 the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.

SA1 28:14  And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man
 cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was
 Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.

SA1 28:15  And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me
 up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war
 against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by
 prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make
 known unto me what I shall do.

SA1 28:16  Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the
 LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

SA1 28:17  And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath
 rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to
 David:

SA1 28:18  Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his
 fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee
 this day.

SA1 28:19  Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand
 of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the
 LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.

SA1 28:20  Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore
 afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for
 he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.

SA1 28:21  And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and
 said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put
 my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto
 me.

SA1 28:22  Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of
 thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that
 thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.

SA1 28:23  But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together
 with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose
 from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

SA1 28:24  And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
 killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread
 thereof:

SA1 28:25  And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they
 did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

SA1 29:1  Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and
 the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.

SA1 29:2  And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
 thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.

SA1 29:3  Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?
 And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the
 servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or
 these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this
 day?

SA1 29:4  And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the
 princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he
 may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go
 down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for
 wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with
 the heads of these men?

SA1 29:5  Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
 saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

SA1 29:6  Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD
 liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me
 in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the
 day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee
 not.

SA1 29:7  Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the
 lords of the Philistines.

SA1 29:8  And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou
 found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I
 may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?

SA1 29:9  And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in
 my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines
 have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.

SA1 29:10  Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's
 servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the
 morning, and have light, depart.

SA1 29:11  So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to
 return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to
 Jezreel.

SA1 30:1  And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on
 the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and
 smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;

SA1 30:2  And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not
 any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.

SA1 30:3  So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned
 with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken
 captives.

SA1 30:4  Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice
 and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

SA1 30:5  And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,
 and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

SA1 30:6  And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning
 him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons
 and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.

SA1 30:7  And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee,
 bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.

SA1 30:8  And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this
 troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt
 surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.

SA1 30:9  So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and
 came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.

SA1 30:10  But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode
 behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.

SA1 30:11  And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
 David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;

SA1 30:12  And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of
 raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had
 eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.

SA1 30:13  And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art
 thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my
 master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.

SA1 30:14  We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the
 coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned
 Ziklag with fire.

SA1 30:15  And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And
 he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me
 into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.

SA1 30:16  And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad
 upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the
 great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out
 of the land of Judah.

SA1 30:17  And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the
 next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men,
 which rode upon camels, and fled.

SA1 30:18  And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and
 David rescued his two wives.

SA1 30:19  And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
 neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken
 to them: David recovered all.

SA1 30:20  And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before
 those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

SA1 30:21  And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they
 could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor:
 and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him:
 and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.

SA1 30:22  Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that
 went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give
 them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife
 and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.

SA1 30:23  Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which
 the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that
 came against us into our hand.

SA1 30:24  For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is
 that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the
 stuff: they shall part alike.

SA1 30:25  And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and
 an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

SA1 30:26  And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders
 of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil
 of the enemies of the LORD;

SA1 30:27  To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south
 Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,

SA1 30:28  And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in
 Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,

SA1 30:29  And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the
 cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the
 Kenites,

SA1 30:30  And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
 Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,

SA1 30:31  And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David
 himself and his men were wont to haunt.

SA1 31:1  Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled
 from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

SA1 31:2  And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and
 the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.

SA1 31:3  And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and
 he was sore wounded of the archers.

SA1 31:4  Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me
 through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and
 abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore
 Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

SA1 31:5  And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise
 upon his sword, and died with him.

SA1 31:6  So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his
 men, that same day together.

SA1 31:7  And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
 valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of
 Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities,
 and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

SA1 31:8  And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip
 the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

SA1 31:9  And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into
 the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their
 idols, and among the people.

SA1 31:10  And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened
 his body to the wall of Bethshan.

SA1 31:11  And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the
 Philistines had done to Saul;

SA1 31:12  All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of
 Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to
 Jabesh, and burnt them there.

SA1 31:13  And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
 Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
