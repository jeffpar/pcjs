## Information about "HOME BUDGET WORK SHEETS"

    Pam's Home Budget Template for LOTUS 123 is well designed for managing
    personal and household finances.  This disk contains 12 monthly files,
    complete with expense management for tax purposes.  Because the files
    are standalone files, only 256k RAM is necessary.  Each file is macro-
    drive and easy to use.  Because of the size of the files, the disk is
    quite full.  Therefore, it is recommended that you copy half the files
    to a work disk for more efficient disk management.  The worksheets are
    well documented, but assumes a limited understanding of simple single
    entry accounting.
    
    System Requirements:  Two disk drives, LOTUS 1-2-3 v1A
    
    How to Start:  Access through LOTUS 1-2-3
