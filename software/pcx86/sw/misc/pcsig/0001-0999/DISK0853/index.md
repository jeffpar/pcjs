## Information about "SPORTS LOG TRACKING SYSTEM"

    If you read the sports page every day avidly, you'll find that you'll
    never be able to figure out how you were unable to live without this
    PC-SIG disk!
    
    SPORTS LOG allows you to track games from the NFL, NBA, and many other
    sport leagues.  You enter the names of the teams in the game and the
    point spread, then your bet on the games.  Once this is done, you can
    enter the results of the games, and the program will figure out your
    accounts automatically and tell you whether you made or lost money in
    each account.
    
    SPORTS LOG also prints a profit-and-loss statement, and lets you entrust
    your gambling urges to a warning system that flags unsettling
    imbalances.  This version of the program is limited to one entry, or
    game, but is fully functional in that aspect.
    
    Special Requirements:  None.
    
    How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration:  $25.00
