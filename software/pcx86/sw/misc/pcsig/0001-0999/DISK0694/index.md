## Information about "SLEUTH"

    This is an interactive text game you can populate with your friends,
    relatives and neighbors.  As you begin a game of SLEUTH, a murder has
    just been committed!
    
    You must explore the house, question the houseguests for alibis and
    locate both the weapon and the scene of the murder. The challenge is to
    solve the crime, gather all of the suspects together and accuse the
    guilty party -- before the killer becomes suspicious and eliminates
    YOU!
    
    This fascinating crime-solving game works on a monochrome monitor, and
    needs only the keyboard for input.
    
    And the killer is . . .
