## Information about "HDP ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES"

    HDP ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES manages your customer accounts and
    transactions for your business. It not only stores, organizes, and
    retrieves customer information, but also lets you edit all data or
    transaction information kept on file for each customer. With HDP
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES you have full control over your transactions and
    invoices.
    
    The reports option lets you print and compute finance charges, print
    mailing labels, and process data at the end of the month. The system
    utilities of the program let you check data files and rebuild the
    various indexes, clear all transactions off accounts, selectively delete
    transactions on one account, and add new customer files.
    
    This version of the program is limited to about 250 customers but does
    not require you to pay a registration fee to use it. If you like it and
    want to upgrade up to the commercial version, you then need to purchase
    the program.
