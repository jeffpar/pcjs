## Information about "PROWRITER UTILITIES"

    This disk contains a copy of the SOFT and EASY UTILITIES for the
    PROWRITER I and II. In addition to the three main program procedures,
    there are ASCII files which contain copies of both the user's manual
    and the appendicies for that manual (together totaling 100+ pages!)
    Each of these ASCII files will produce a formatted manual, (or
    appendix), on your PROWRITER I or II dot matrix printer.  DO NOT
    ATTEMPT TO PRINT THESE FILES ON ANY OTHER PRINTERS.  IT JUST WON'T
    WORK...
    
    System Requirements: Some programs require BASIC
    
    How to Start: Consult the MANUAL.DOC and APPENDIX.DOC files for
    directions.  To run a program with the suffix .COM, .EXE, or .BAT,
    just type its name, i.e., for PRNT-SCN.COM, type PRNTSCN and hit
    <ENTER>.  To run the BASIC programs, consult the directions in GETTING
    STARTED for your configuration.
