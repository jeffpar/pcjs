## Information about "THE BIBLE 1OF7 (767,768,769,770,771,772)"

    This disk is part of a seven-disk set with the entire King James version
    of the Bible.  It is in text file format, making it easy to locate
    verses, add passages into documents, or prepare manuscript studies.
    
    Since it is all ASCII text files, each book is a separate file.  When
    you get the disks, the files are archived, or ``squeezed'', so you must
    first unsqueeze them onto either 19 other 360K floppies or onto your
    hard drive.  Be advised that some books of the Bible are too long to fit
    into some wordprocessors that limit the size of documents to the amount
    of available RAM.
    
    To view or search these files, you need to use a wordprocessor or some
    kind of viewing shell.  No such program is provided on this disk.
