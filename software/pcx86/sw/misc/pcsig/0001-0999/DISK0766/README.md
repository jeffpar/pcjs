## Information about "THE BIBLE 1OF7 (767,768,769,770,771,772)"

    This disk is part of a seven-disk set with the entire King James version
    of the Bible.  It is in text file format, making it easy to locate
    verses, add passages into documents, or prepare manuscript studies.
    
    Since it is all ASCII text files, each book is a separate file.  When
    you get the disks, the files are archived, or ``squeezed'', so you must
    first unsqueeze them onto either 19 other 360K floppies or onto your
    hard drive.  Be advised that some books of the Bible are too long to fit
    into some wordprocessors that limit the size of documents to the amount
    of available RAM.
    
    To view or search these files, you need to use a wordprocessor or some
    kind of viewing shell.  No such program is provided on this disk.

EXO 1:1  Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
 Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

EXO 1:2  Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

EXO 1:3  Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

EXO 1:4  Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

EXO 1:5  And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
 souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

EXO 1:6  And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.

EXO 1:7  And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
 abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was
 filled with them.

EXO 1:8  Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.

EXO 1:9  And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of
 Israel are more and mightier than we:

EXO 1:10  Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it
 come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our
 enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.

EXO 1:11  Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
 their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and
 Raamses.

EXO 1:12  But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.
 And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

EXO 1:13  And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:

EXO 1:14  And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in
 brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein
 they made them serve, was with rigour.

EXO 1:15  And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name
 of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:

EXO 1:16  And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
 women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him:
 but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

EXO 1:17  But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
 commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

EXO 1:18  And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them,
 Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?

EXO 1:19  And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not
 as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the
 midwives come in unto them.

EXO 1:20  Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
 multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

EXO 1:21  And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made
 them houses.

EXO 1:22  And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye
 shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

EXO 2:1  And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter
 of Levi.

EXO 2:2  And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he
 was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

EXO 2:3  And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of
 bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child
 therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.

EXO 2:4  And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

EXO 2:5  And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river;
 and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark
 among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.

EXO 2:6  And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe
 wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews'
 children.

EXO 2:7  Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call
 to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?

EXO 2:8  And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called
 the child's mother.

EXO 2:9  And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse
 it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and
 nursed it.

EXO 2:10  And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and
 he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I
 drew him out of the water.

EXO 2:11  And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went
 out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian
 smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.

EXO 2:12  And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was
 no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

EXO 2:13  And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews
 strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest
 thou thy fellow?

EXO 2:14  And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest
 thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said,
 Surely this thing is known.

EXO 2:15  Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses
 fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat
 down by a well.

EXO 2:16  Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew
 water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

EXO 2:17  And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and
 helped them, and watered their flock.

EXO 2:18  And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye
 are come so soon to day?

EXO 2:19  And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
 shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.

EXO 2:20  And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye
 have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

EXO 2:21  And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
 Zipporah his daughter.

EXO 2:22  And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said,
 I have been a stranger in a strange land.

EXO 2:23  And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died:
 and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they
 cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

EXO 2:24  And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with
 Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

EXO 2:25  And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto
 them.

EXO 3:1  Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of
 Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the
 mountain of God, even to Horeb.

EXO 3:2  And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
 of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with
 fire, and the bush was not consumed.

EXO 3:3  And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why
 the bush is not burnt.

EXO 3:4  And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him
 out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.

EXO 3:5  And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy
 feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

EXO 3:6  Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the
 God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid
 to look upon God.

EXO 3:7  And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people
 which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters;
 for I know their sorrows;

EXO 3:8  And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
 and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a
 land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the
 Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
 Jebusites.

EXO 3:9  Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto
 me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.

EXO 3:10  Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
 mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

EXO 3:11  And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and
 that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

EXO 3:12  And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token
 unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out
 of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

EXO 3:13  And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
 Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto
 you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?

EXO 3:14  And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou
 say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

EXO 3:15  And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
 children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God
 of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for
 ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

EXO 3:16  Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The
 LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,
 appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is
 done to you in Egypt:

EXO 3:17  And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt
 unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
 Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk
 and honey.

EXO 3:18  And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and
 the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The
 LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee,
 three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD
 our God.

EXO 3:19  And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by
 a mighty hand.

EXO 3:20  And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders
 which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.

EXO 3:21  And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and
 it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.

EXO 3:22  But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
 sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
 and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall
 spoil the Egyptians.

EXO 4:1  And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me,
 nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto
 thee.

EXO 4:2  And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A
 rod.

EXO 4:3  And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and
 it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

EXO 4:4  And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the
 tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his
 hand:

EXO 4:5  That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of
 Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.

EXO 4:6  And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy
 bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold,
 his hand was leprous as snow.

EXO 4:7  And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand
 into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was
 turned again as his other flesh.

EXO 4:8  And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
 hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice
 of the latter sign.

EXO 4:9  And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two
 signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water
 of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest
 out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

EXO 4:10  And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither
 heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of
 speech, and of a slow tongue.

EXO 4:11  And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh
 the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?

EXO 4:12  Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what
 thou shalt say.

EXO 4:13  And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom
 thou wilt send.

EXO 4:14  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is
 not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also,
 behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad
 in his heart.

EXO 4:15  And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will
 be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.

EXO 4:16  And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even
 he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of
 God.

EXO 4:17  And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do
 signs.

EXO 4:18  And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said
 unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in
 Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in
 peace.

EXO 4:19  And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for
 all the men are dead which sought thy life.

EXO 4:20  And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and
 he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.

EXO 4:21  And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt,
 see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine
 hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.

EXO 4:22  And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my
 son, even my firstborn:

EXO 4:23  And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou
 refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.

EXO 4:24  And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and
 sought to kill him.

EXO 4:25  Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her
 son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to
 me.

EXO 4:26  So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because
 of the circumcision.

EXO 4:27  And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And
 he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

EXO 4:28  And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and
 all the signs which he had commanded him.

EXO 4:29  And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the
 children of Israel:

EXO 4:30  And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses,
 and did the signs in the sight of the people.

EXO 4:31  And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had
 visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their
 affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

EXO 5:1  And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith
 the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me
 in the wilderness.

EXO 5:2  And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let
 Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.

EXO 5:3  And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we
 pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD
 our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

EXO 5:4  And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
 Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.

EXO 5:5  And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye
 make them rest from their burdens.

EXO 5:6  And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and
 their officers, saying,

EXO 5:7  Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore:
 let them go and gather straw for themselves.

EXO 5:8  And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall
 lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle;
 therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

EXO 5:9  Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
 therein; and let them not regard vain words.

EXO 5:10  And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and
 they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you
 straw.

EXO 5:11  Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work
 shall be diminished.

EXO 5:12  So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt
 to gather stubble instead of straw.

EXO 5:13  And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your
 daily tasks, as when there was straw.

EXO 5:14  And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
 taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye
 not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as
 heretofore?

EXO 5:15  Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto
 Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?

EXO 5:16  There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make
 brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own
 people.

EXO 5:17  But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go
 and do sacrifice to the LORD.

EXO 5:18  Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you,
 yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

EXO 5:19  And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in
 evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of
 your daily task.

EXO 5:20  And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
 forth from Pharaoh:

EXO 5:21  And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because
 ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the
 eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

EXO 5:22  And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou
 so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?

EXO 5:23  For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil
 to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

EXO 6:1  Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to
 Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand
 shall he drive them out of his land.

EXO 6:2  And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:

EXO 6:3  And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name
 of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

EXO 6:4  And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the
 land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

EXO 6:5  And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the
 Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

EXO 6:6  Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will
 bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out
 of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with
 great judgments:

EXO 6:7  And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God:
 and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from
 under the burdens of the Egyptians.

EXO 6:8  And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did
 swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you
 for an heritage: I am the LORD.

EXO 6:9  And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not
 unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

EXO 6:10  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 6:11  Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of
 Israel go out of his land.

EXO 6:12  And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of
 Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of
 uncircumcised lips?

EXO 6:13  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge
 unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the
 children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

EXO 6:14  These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the
 firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the
 families of Reuben.

EXO 6:15  And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and
 Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of
 Simeon.

EXO 6:16  And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
 generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of
 Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

EXO 6:17  The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.

EXO 6:18  And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and
 the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.

EXO 6:19  And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of
 Levi according to their generations.

EXO 6:20  And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare
 him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and
 thirty and seven years.

EXO 6:21  And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

EXO 6:22  And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

EXO 6:23  And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
 Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

EXO 6:24  And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are
 the families of the Korhites.

EXO 6:25  And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to
 wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the
 Levites according to their families.

EXO 6:26  These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the
 children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.

EXO 6:27  These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the
 children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.

EXO 6:28  And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the
 land of Egypt,

EXO 6:29  That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou
 unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

EXO 6:30  And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips,
 and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

EXO 7:1  And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh:
 and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

EXO 7:2  Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall
 speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.

EXO 7:3  And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my
 wonders in the land of Egypt.

EXO 7:4  But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon
 Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out
 of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

EXO 7:5  And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth
 mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.

EXO 7:6  And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.

EXO 7:7  And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years
 old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

EXO 7:8  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

EXO 7:9  When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you:
 then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and
 it shall become a serpent.

EXO 7:10  And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD
 had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his
 servants, and it became a serpent.

EXO 7:11  Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
 magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.

EXO 7:12  For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but
 Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

EXO 7:13  And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as
 the LORD had said.

EXO 7:14  And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
 refuseth to let the people go.

EXO 7:15  Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the
 water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod
 which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.

EXO 7:16  And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me
 unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the
 wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.

EXO 7:17  Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:
 behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which
 are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

EXO 7:18  And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall
 stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.

EXO 7:19  And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
 stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon
 their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that
 they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of
 Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

EXO 7:20  And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up
 the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of
 Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were
 in the river were turned to blood.

EXO 7:21  And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the
 Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood
 throughout all the land of Egypt.

EXO 7:22  And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
 Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD
 had said.

EXO 7:23  And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his
 heart to this also.

EXO 7:24  And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to
 drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

EXO 7:25  And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the
 river.

EXO 8:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus
 saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

EXO 8:2  And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy
 borders with frogs:

EXO 8:3  And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up
 and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and
 into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens,
 and into thy kneadingtroughs:

EXO 8:4  And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and
 upon all thy servants.

EXO 8:5  And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine
 hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and
 cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

EXO 8:6  And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the
 frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

EXO 8:7  And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs
 upon the land of Egypt.

EXO 8:8  Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD,
 that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let
 the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.

EXO 8:9  And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for
 thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from
 thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?

EXO 8:10  And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word:
 that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.

EXO 8:11  And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from
 thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.

EXO 8:12  And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the
 LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

EXO 8:13  And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died
 out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

EXO 8:14  And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.

EXO 8:15  But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
 heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

EXO 8:16  And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
 rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all
 the land of Egypt.

EXO 8:17  And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and
 smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the
 dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

EXO 8:18  And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice,
 but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

EXO 8:19  Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and
 Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had
 said.

EXO 8:20  And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand
 before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus
 saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

EXO 8:21  Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms
 of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy
 houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and
 also the ground whereon they are.

EXO 8:22  And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people
 dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know
 that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.

EXO 8:23  And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow
 shall this sign be.

EXO 8:24  And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into
 the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of
 Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.

EXO 8:25  And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
 sacrifice to your God in the land.

EXO 8:26  And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the
 abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the
 abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

EXO 8:27  We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice
 to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.

EXO 8:28  And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the
 LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat
 for me.

EXO 8:29  And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the
 LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and
 from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in
 not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.

EXO 8:30  And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

EXO 8:31  And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the
 swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there
 remained not one.

EXO 8:32  And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he
 let the people go.

EXO 9:1  Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus
 saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

EXO 9:2  For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

EXO 9:3  Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,
 upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the
 sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.

EXO 9:4  And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle
 of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of
 Israel.

EXO 9:5  And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do
 this thing in the land.

EXO 9:6  And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt
 died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.

EXO 9:7  And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the
 Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let
 the people go.

EXO 9:8  And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of
 ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the
 sight of Pharaoh.

EXO 9:9  And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be
 a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all
 the land of Egypt.

EXO 9:10  And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and
 Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with
 blains upon man, and upon beast.

EXO 9:11  And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils;
 for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

EXO 9:12  And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto
 them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

EXO 9:13  And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand
 before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let
 my people go, that they may serve me.

EXO 9:14  For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and
 upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is
 none like me in all the earth.

EXO 9:15  For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
 people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.

EXO 9:16  And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew
 in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.

EXO 9:17  As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not
 let them go?

EXO 9:18  Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very
 grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof
 even until now.

EXO 9:19  Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast
 in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the
 field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and
 they shall die.

EXO 9:20  He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh
 made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

EXO 9:21  And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and
 his cattle in the field.

EXO 9:22  And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven,
 that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon
 beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.

EXO 9:23  And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent
 thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained
 hail upon the land of Egypt.

EXO 9:24  So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
 such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a
 nation.

EXO 9:25  And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was
 in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the
 field, and brake every tree of the field.

EXO 9:26  Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was
 there no hail.

EXO 9:27  And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them,
 I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are
 wicked.

EXO 9:28  Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty
 thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.

EXO 9:29  And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will
 spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither
 shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the
 LORD's.

EXO 9:30  But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear
 the LORD God.

EXO 9:31  And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the
 ear, and the flax was bolled.

EXO 9:32  But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown
 up.

EXO 9:33  And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his
 hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not
 poured upon the earth.

EXO 9:34  And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were
 ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

EXO 9:35  And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the
 children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

EXO 10:1  And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened
 his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs
 before him:

EXO 10:2  And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's
 son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done
 among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.

EXO 10:3  And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus
 saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble
 thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.

EXO 10:4  Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I
 bring the locusts into thy coast:

EXO 10:5  And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able
 to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped,
 which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which
 groweth for you out of the field:

EXO 10:6  And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy
 servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor
 thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth
 unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

EXO 10:7  And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a
 snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God:
 knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

EXO 10:8  And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto
 them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?

EXO 10:9  And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our
 sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;
 for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.

EXO 10:10  And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let
 you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.

EXO 10:11  Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did
 desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

EXO 10:12  And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land
 of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and
 eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.

EXO 10:13  And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the
 LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and
 when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

EXO 10:14  And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all
 the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such
 locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

EXO 10:15  For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was
 darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the
 trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the
 trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.

EXO 10:16  Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
 have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

EXO 10:17  Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
 intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.

EXO 10:18  And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

EXO 10:19  And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the
 locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all
 the coasts of Egypt.

EXO 10:20  But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the
 children of Israel go.

EXO 10:21  And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven,
 that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be
 felt.

EXO 10:22  And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a
 thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

EXO 10:23  They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three
 days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

EXO 10:24  And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only
 let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with
 you.

EXO 10:25  And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
 offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

EXO 10:26  Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left
 behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not
 with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.

EXO 10:27  But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.

EXO 10:28  And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself,
 see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.

EXO 10:29  And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no
 more.

EXO 11:1  And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon
 Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall
 let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.

EXO 11:2  Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his
 neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of
 gold.

EXO 11:3  And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians.
 Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of
 Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

EXO 11:4  And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out
 into the midst of Egypt:

EXO 11:5  And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first
 born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the
 maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.

EXO 11:6  And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such
 as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

EXO 11:7  But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his
 tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a
 difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

EXO 11:8  And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
 themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow
 thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great
 anger.

EXO 11:9  And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;
 that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

EXO 11:10  And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the
 LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of
 Israel go out of his land.

EXO 12:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,

EXO 12:2  This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the
 first month of the year to you.

EXO 12:3  Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth
 day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the
 house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:

EXO 12:4  And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his
 neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;
 every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.

EXO 12:5  Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye
 shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

EXO 12:6  And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month:
 and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the
 evening.

EXO 12:7  And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts
 and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.

EXO 12:8  And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and
 unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

EXO 12:9  Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire;
 his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

EXO 12:10  And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that
 which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

EXO 12:11  And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your
 feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the
 LORD's passover.

EXO 12:12  For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite
 all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all
 the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.

EXO 12:13  And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye
 are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not
 be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

EXO 12:14  And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it
 a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by
 an ordinance for ever.

EXO 12:15  Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye
 shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread
 from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from
 Israel.

EXO 12:16  And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the
 seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work
 shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be
 done of you.

EXO 12:17  And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this
 selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore
 shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.

EXO 12:18  In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye
 shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at
 even.

EXO 12:19  Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
 whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from
 the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.

EXO 12:20  Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat
 unleavened bread.

EXO 12:21  Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them,
 Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the
 passover.

EXO 12:22  And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is
 in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood
 that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house
 until the morning.

EXO 12:23  For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he
 seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will
 pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your
 houses to smite you.

EXO 12:24  And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy
 sons for ever.

EXO 12:25  And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the
 LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this
 service.

EXO 12:26  And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you,
 What mean ye by this service?

EXO 12:27  That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who
 passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the
 Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and
 worshipped.

EXO 12:28  And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had
 commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

EXO 12:29  And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
 firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his
 throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the
 firstborn of cattle.

EXO 12:30  And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all
 the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house
 where there was not one dead.

EXO 12:31  And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and
 get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and
 go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.

EXO 12:32  Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone;
 and bless me also.

EXO 12:33  And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send
 them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.

EXO 12:34  And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
 kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

EXO 12:35  And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and
 they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
 raiment:

EXO 12:36  And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians,
 so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled
 the Egyptians.

EXO 12:37  And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about
 six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.

EXO 12:38  And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds,
 even very much cattle.

EXO 12:39  And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
 forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of
 Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any
 victual.

EXO 12:40  Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,
 was four hundred and thirty years.

EXO 12:41  And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years,
 even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went
 out from the land of Egypt.

EXO 12:42  It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them
 out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of
 all the children of Israel in their generations.

EXO 12:43  And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the
 passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

EXO 12:44  But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast
 circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

EXO 12:45  A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

EXO 12:46  In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought
 of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.

EXO 12:47  All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

EXO 12:48  And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
 passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come
 near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no
 uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

EXO 12:49  One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that
 sojourneth among you.

EXO 12:50  Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and
 Aaron, so did they.

EXO 12:51  And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the
 children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

EXO 13:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 13:2  Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among
 the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

EXO 13:3  And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came
 out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD
 brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.

EXO 13:4  This day came ye out in the month Abib.

EXO 13:5  And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the
 Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the
 Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with
 milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.

EXO 13:6  Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day
 shall be a feast to the LORD.

EXO 13:7  Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
 leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with
 thee in all thy quarters.

EXO 13:8  And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because
 of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.

EXO 13:9  And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a
 memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for
 with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.

EXO 13:10  Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to
 year.

EXO 13:11  And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the
 Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,

EXO 13:12  That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the
 matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males
 shall be the LORD's.

EXO 13:13  And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if
 thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the
 firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.

EXO 13:14  And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying,
 What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD
 brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:

EXO 13:15  And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the
 LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of
 man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that
 openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I
 redeem.

EXO 13:16  And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
 between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of
 Egypt.

EXO 13:17  And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God
 led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that
 was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see
 war, and they return to Egypt:

EXO 13:18  But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness
 of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land
 of Egypt.

EXO 13:19  And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly
 sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall
 carry up my bones away hence with you.

EXO 13:20  And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,
 in the edge of the wilderness.

EXO 13:21  And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead
 them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by
 day and night:

EXO 13:22  He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of
 fire by night, from before the people.

EXO 14:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 14:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before
 Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it
 shall ye encamp by the sea.

EXO 14:3  For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled
 in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

EXO 14:4  And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them;
 and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the
 Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.

EXO 14:5  And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart
 of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said,
 Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?

EXO 14:6  And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

EXO 14:7  And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of
 Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

EXO 14:8  And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he
 pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out
 with an high hand.

EXO 14:9  But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of
 Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the
 sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.

EXO 14:10  And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their
 eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore
 afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.

EXO 14:11  And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,
 hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt
 thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?

EXO 14:12  Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us
 alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to
 serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

EXO 14:13  And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see
 the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the
 Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.

EXO 14:14  The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

EXO 14:15  And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak
 unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

EXO 14:16  But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the
 sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through
 the midst of the sea.

EXO 14:17  And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they
 shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his
 host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

EXO 14:18  And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten
 me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

EXO 14:19  And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed
 and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their
 face, and stood behind them:

EXO 14:20  And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of
 Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night
 to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.

EXO 14:21  And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused
 the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry
 land, and the waters were divided.

EXO 14:22  And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the
 dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on
 their left.

EXO 14:23  And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
 of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

EXO 14:24  And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto
 the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and
 troubled the host of the Egyptians,

EXO 14:25  And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so
 that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD
 fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

EXO 14:26  And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea,
 that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and
 upon their horsemen.

EXO 14:27  And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
 returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled
 against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

EXO 14:28  And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
 horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them;
 there remained not so much as one of them.

EXO 14:29  But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the
 sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their
 left.

EXO 14:30  Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
 Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.

EXO 14:31  And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
 Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his
 servant Moses.

EXO 15:1  Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
 LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed
 gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

EXO 15:2  The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he
 is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will
 exalt him.

EXO 15:3  The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.

EXO 15:4  Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen
 captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

EXO 15:5  The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.

EXO 15:6  Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand,
 O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

EXO 15:7  And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them
 that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them
 as stubble.

EXO 15:8  And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
 together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed
 in the heart of the sea.

EXO 15:9  The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
 spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand
 shall destroy them.

EXO 15:10  Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as
 lead in the mighty waters.

EXO 15:11  Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,
 glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

EXO 15:12  Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

EXO 15:13  Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
 redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.

EXO 15:14  The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the
 inhabitants of Palestina.

EXO 15:15  Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
 trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt
 away.

EXO 15:16  Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm
 they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till
 the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

EXO 15:17  Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine
 inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in,
 in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established.

EXO 15:18  The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

EXO 15:19  For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
 horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon
 them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.

EXO 15:20  And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in
 her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

EXO 15:21  And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed
 gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

EXO 15:22  So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the
 wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no
 water.

EXO 15:23  And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of
 Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

EXO 15:24  And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

EXO 15:25  And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which
 when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made
 for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,

EXO 15:26  And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD
 thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to
 his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these
 diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the
 LORD that healeth thee.

EXO 15:27  And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
 threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

EXO 16:1  And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation
 of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between
 Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their
 departing out of the land of Egypt.

EXO 16:2  And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against
 Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

EXO 16:3  And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died
 by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots,
 and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this
 wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

EXO 16:4  Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven
 for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day,
 that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.

EXO 16:5  And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare
 that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.

EXO 16:6  And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
 even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of
 Egypt:

EXO 16:7  And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that
 he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur
 against us?

EXO 16:8  And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the
 evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD
 heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your
 murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.

EXO 16:9  And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the
 children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your
 murmurings.

EXO 16:10  And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation
 of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and,
 behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.

EXO 16:11  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 16:12  I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto
 them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be
 filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.

EXO 16:13  And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered
 the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

EXO 16:14  And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the
 wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the
 ground.

EXO 16:15  And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It
 is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is
 the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.

EXO 16:16  This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every
 man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number
 of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.

EXO 16:17  And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some
 less.

EXO 16:18  And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had
 nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every
 man according to his eating.

EXO 16:19  And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

EXO 16:20  Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left
 of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth
 with them.

EXO 16:21  And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
 eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

EXO 16:22  And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as
 much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation
 came and told Moses.

EXO 16:23  And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To
 morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will
 bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over
 lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

EXO 16:24  And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not
 stink, neither was there any worm therein.

EXO 16:25  And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the
 LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

EXO 16:26  Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the
 sabbath, in it there shall be none.

EXO 16:27  And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the
 seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

EXO 16:28  And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
 commandments and my laws?

EXO 16:29  See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he
 giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his
 place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

EXO 16:30  So the people rested on the seventh day.

EXO 16:31  And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was
 like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with
 honey.

EXO 16:32  And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an
 omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread
 wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the
 land of Egypt.

EXO 16:33  And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna
 therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.

EXO 16:34  As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
 Testimony, to be kept.

EXO 16:35  And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they
 came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the
 borders of the land of Canaan.

EXO 16:36  Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

EXO 17:1  And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the
 wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the
 LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to
 drink.

EXO 17:2  Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water
 that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore
 do ye tempt the LORD?

EXO 17:3  And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured
 against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out
 of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?

EXO 17:4  And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this
 people? they be almost ready to stone me.

EXO 17:5  And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with
 thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river,
 take in thine hand, and go.

EXO 17:6  Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and
 thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the
 people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

EXO 17:7  And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because
 of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD,
 saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?

EXO 17:8  Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

EXO 17:9  And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with
 Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in
 mine hand.

EXO 17:10  So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and
 Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

EXO 17:11  And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
 prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

EXO 17:12  But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under
 him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on
 the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady
 until the going down of the sun.

EXO 17:13  And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the
 sword.

EXO 17:14  And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
 book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the
 remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

EXO 17:15  And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:

EXO 17:16  For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war
 with Amalek from generation to generation.

EXO 18:1  When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all
 that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had
 brought Israel out of Egypt;

EXO 18:2  Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after
 he had sent her back,

EXO 18:3  And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he
 said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

EXO 18:4  And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said
 he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:

EXO 18:5  And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife
 unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:

EXO 18:6  And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto
 thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

EXO 18:7  And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and
 kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into
 the tent.

EXO 18:8  And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto
 Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had
 come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.

EXO 18:9  And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to
 Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

EXO 18:10  And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out
 of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath
 delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

EXO 18:11  Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing
 wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

EXO 18:12  And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
 sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat
 bread with Moses' father in law before God.

EXO 18:13  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
 people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.

EXO 18:14  And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he
 said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou
 thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?

EXO 18:15  And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto
 me to enquire of God:

EXO 18:16  When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one
 and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.

EXO 18:17  And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is
 not good.

EXO 18:18  Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with
 thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it
 thyself alone.

EXO 18:19  Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall
 be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the
 causes unto God:

EXO 18:20  And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them
 the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.

EXO 18:21  Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as
 fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be
 rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of
 tens:

EXO 18:22  And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that
 every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they
 shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the
 burden with thee.

EXO 18:23  If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou
 shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in
 peace.

EXO 18:24  So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all
 that he had said.

EXO 18:25  And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over
 the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and
 rulers of tens.

EXO 18:26  And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they
 brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

EXO 18:27  And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his
 own land.

EXO 19:1  In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out
 of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.

EXO 19:2  For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of
 Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the
 mount.

EXO 19:3  And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the
 mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the
 children of Israel;

EXO 19:4  Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on
 eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

EXO 19:5  Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
 covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for
 all the earth is mine:

EXO 19:6  And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.
 These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.

EXO 19:7  And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid
 before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.

EXO 19:8  And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD
 hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the
 LORD.

EXO 19:9  And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud,
 that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever.
 And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.

EXO 19:10  And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them
 to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

EXO 19:11  And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will
 come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.

EXO 19:12  And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take
 heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of
 it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:

EXO 19:13  There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or
 shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet
 soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.

EXO 19:14  And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified
 the people; and they washed their clothes.

EXO 19:15  And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come
 not at your wives.

EXO 19:16  And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were
 thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice
 of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp
 trembled.

EXO 19:17  And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God;
 and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

EXO 19:18  And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
 descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a
 furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

EXO 19:19  And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and
 louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.

EXO 19:20  And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount:
 and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.

EXO 19:21  And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they
 break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.

EXO 19:22  And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify
 themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

EXO 19:23  And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount
 Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and
 sanctify it.

EXO 19:24  And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come
 up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break
 through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.

EXO 19:25  So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

EXO 20:1  And God spake all these words, saying,

EXO 20:2  I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of
 Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

EXO 20:3  Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

EXO 20:4  Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
 any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that
 is in the water under the earth.

EXO 20:5  Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the
 LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
 children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

EXO 20:6  And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
 commandments.

EXO 20:7  Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the
 LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

EXO 20:8  Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

EXO 20:9  Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

EXO 20:10  But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou
 shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant,
 nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
 gates:

EXO 20:11  For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
 that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the
 sabbath day, and hallowed it.

EXO 20:12  Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the
 land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

EXO 20:13  Thou shalt not kill.

EXO 20:14  Thou shalt not commit adultery.

EXO 20:15  Thou shalt not steal.

EXO 20:16  Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

EXO 20:17  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy
 neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor
 his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

EXO 20:18  And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the
 noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw
 it, they removed, and stood afar off.

EXO 20:19  And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but
 let not God speak with us, lest we die.

EXO 20:20  And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove
 you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.

EXO 20:21  And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick
 darkness where God was.

EXO 20:22  And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children
 of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

EXO 20:23  Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto
 you gods of gold.

EXO 20:24  An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
 thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine
 oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will
 bless thee.

EXO 20:25  And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it
 of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.

EXO 20:26  Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
 nakedness be not discovered thereon.

EXO 21:1  Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

EXO 21:2  If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the
 seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

EXO 21:3  If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were
 married, then his wife shall go out with him.

EXO 21:4  If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or
 daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go
 out by himself.

EXO 21:5  And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and
 my children; I will not go out free:

EXO 21:6  Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring
 him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear
 through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.

EXO 21:7  And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go
 out as the menservants do.

EXO 21:8  If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then
 shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have
 no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

EXO 21:9  And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her
 after the manner of daughters.

EXO 21:10  If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of
 marriage, shall he not diminish.

EXO 21:11  And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free
 without money.

EXO 21:12  He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.

EXO 21:13  And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;
 then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

EXO 21:14  But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him
 with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.

EXO 21:15  And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put
 to death.

EXO 21:16  And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in
 his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

EXO 21:17  And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put
 to death.

EXO 21:18  And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or
 with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

EXO 21:19  If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that
 smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall
 cause him to be thoroughly healed.

EXO 21:20  And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die
 under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

EXO 21:21  Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be
 punished: for he is his money.

EXO 21:22  If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart
 from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according
 as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges
 determine.

EXO 21:23  And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,

EXO 21:24  Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

EXO 21:25  Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

EXO 21:26  And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid,
 that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.

EXO 21:27  And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's
 tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.

EXO 21:28  If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be
 surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox
 shall be quit.

EXO 21:29  But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it
 hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he
 hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also
 shall be put to death.

EXO 21:30  If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the
 ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

EXO 21:31  Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to
 this judgment shall it be done unto him.

EXO 21:32  If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give
 unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

EXO 21:33  And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not
 cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

EXO 21:34  The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the
 owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

EXO 21:35  And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall
 sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall
 divide.

EXO 21:36  Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and
 his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead
 shall be his own.

EXO 22:1  If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he
 shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

EXO 22:2  If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there
 shall no blood be shed for him.

EXO 22:3  If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for
 he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold
 for his theft.

EXO 22:4  If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox,
 or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

EXO 22:5  If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put
 in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own
 field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.

EXO 22:6  If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn,
 or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled
 the fire shall surely make restitution.

EXO 22:7  If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and
 it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay
 double.

EXO 22:8  If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be
 brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his
 neighbour's goods.

EXO 22:9  For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep,
 for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be
 his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the
 judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.

EXO 22:10  If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or
 any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:

EXO 22:11  Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath
 not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept
 thereof, and he shall not make it good.

EXO 22:12  And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the
 owner thereof.

EXO 22:13  If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he
 shall not make good that which was torn.

EXO 22:14  And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or
 die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.

EXO 22:15  But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if
 it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

EXO 22:16  And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her,
 he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

EXO 22:17  If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay
 money according to the dowry of virgins.

EXO 22:18  Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

EXO 22:19  Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

EXO 22:20  He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall
 be utterly destroyed.

EXO 22:21  Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were
 strangers in the land of Egypt.

EXO 22:22  Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

EXO 22:23  If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I
 will surely hear their cry;

EXO 22:24  And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and
 your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

EXO 22:25  If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou
 shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.

EXO 22:26  If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt
 deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

EXO 22:27  For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin:
 wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me,
 that I will hear; for I am gracious.

EXO 22:28  Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.

EXO 22:29  Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of
 thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

EXO 22:30  Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven
 days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

EXO 22:31  And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh
 that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.

EXO 23:1  Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the
 wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

EXO 23:2  Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou
 speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

EXO 23:3  Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

EXO 23:4  If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt
 surely bring it back to him again.

EXO 23:5  If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his
 burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.

EXO 23:6  Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

EXO 23:7  Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous
 slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

EXO 23:8  And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and
 perverteth the words of the righteous.

EXO 23:9  Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a
 stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

EXO 23:10  And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
 fruits thereof:

EXO 23:11  But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the
 poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall
 eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy
 oliveyard.

EXO 23:12  Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt
 rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and
 the stranger, may be refreshed.

EXO 23:13  And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make
 no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy
 mouth.

EXO 23:14  Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

EXO 23:15  Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat
 unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed
 of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall
 appear before me empty:)

EXO 23:16  And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou
 hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end
 of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.

EXO 23:17  Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the LORD
 God.

EXO 23:18  Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread;
 neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

EXO 23:19  The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the
 house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

EXO 23:20  Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to
 bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

EXO 23:21  Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not
 pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

EXO 23:22  But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak;
 then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine
 adversaries.

EXO 23:23  For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the
 Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the
 Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.

EXO 23:24  Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after
 their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down
 their images.

EXO 23:25  And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy
 bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.

EXO 23:26  There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land:
 the number of thy days I will fulfil.

EXO 23:27  I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to
 whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto
 thee.

EXO 23:28  And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
 Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

EXO 23:29  I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the
 land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.

EXO 23:30  By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until
 thou be increased, and inherit the land.

EXO 23:31  And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the
 Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the
 inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before
 thee.

EXO 23:32  Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

EXO 23:33  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against
 me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

EXO 24:1  And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron,
 Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar
 off.

EXO 24:2  And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come
 nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

EXO 24:3  And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all
 the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the
 words which the LORD hath said will we do.

EXO 24:4  And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the
 morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according
 to the twelve tribes of Israel.

EXO 24:5  And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt
 offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.

EXO 24:6  And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half
 of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

EXO 24:7  And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the
 people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be
 obedient.

EXO 24:8  And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said,
 Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you
 concerning all these words.

EXO 24:9  Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the
 elders of Israel:

EXO 24:10  And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it
 were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in
 his clearness.

EXO 24:11  And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand:
 also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

EXO 24:12  And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be
 there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments
 which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.

EXO 24:13  And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into
 the mount of God.

EXO 24:14  And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come
 again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any
 matters to do, let him come unto them.

EXO 24:15  And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.

EXO 24:16  And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud
 covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the
 midst of the cloud.

EXO 24:17  And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on
 the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

EXO 24:18  And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the
 mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

EXO 25:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 25:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of
 every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.

EXO 25:3  And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and
 silver, and brass,

EXO 25:4  And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

EXO 25:5  And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

EXO 25:6  Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,

 part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a
 drink offering.

EXO 29:41  And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto
 according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink
 offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

EXO 29:42  This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations
 at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I
 will meet you, to speak there unto thee.

EXO 29:43  And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
 tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

EXO 29:44  And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the
 altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the
 priest's office.

EXO 29:45  And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their
 God.

EXO 29:46  And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them
 forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD
 their God.

EXO 30:1  And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood
 shalt thou make it.

EXO 30:2  A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof;
 foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns
 thereof shall be of the same.

EXO 30:3  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the
 sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it
 a crown of gold round about.

EXO 30:4  And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by
 the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and
 they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.

EXO 30:5  And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with
 gold.

EXO 30:6  And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the
 testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will
 meet with thee.

EXO 30:7  And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he
 dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

EXO 30:8  And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon
 it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.

EXO 30:9  Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor
 meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.

EXO 30:10  And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a
 year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall
 he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto
 the LORD.

EXO 30:11  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 30:12  When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their
 number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD,
 when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou
 numberest them.

EXO 30:13  This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are
 numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is
 twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.

EXO 30:14  Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty
 years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.

EXO 30:15  The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than
 half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement
 for your souls.

EXO 30:16  And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
 Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the
 congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before
 the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

EXO 30:17  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 30:18  Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass,
 to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the
 congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.

EXO 30:19  For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
 thereat:

EXO 30:20  When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall
 wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to
 minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:

EXO 30:21  So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not:
 and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed
 throughout their generations.

EXO 30:22  Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 30:23  Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five
 hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and
 fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,

EXO 30:24  And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
 sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

EXO 30:25  And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound
 after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.

EXO 30:26  And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
 therewith, and the ark of the testimony,

EXO 30:27  And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his
 vessels, and the altar of incense,

EXO 30:28  And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver
 and his foot.

EXO 30:29  And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever
 toucheth them shall be holy.

EXO 30:30  And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that
 they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

EXO 30:31  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall
 be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.

EXO 30:32  Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any
 other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy
 unto you.

EXO 30:33  Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it
 upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

EXO 30:34  And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,
 stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense:
 of each shall there be a like weight:

EXO 30:35  And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the
 apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:

EXO 30:36  And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the
 testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee:
 it shall be unto you most holy.

EXO 30:37  And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to
 yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy
 for the LORD.

EXO 30:38  Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be
 cut off from his people.

EXO 31:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 31:2  See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur,
 of the tribe of Judah:

EXO 31:3  And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in
 understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,

EXO 31:4  To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in
 brass,

EXO 31:5  And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to
 work in all manner of workmanship.

EXO 31:6  And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach,
 of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have
 put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;

EXO 31:7  The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and
 the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,

EXO 31:8  And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all
 his furniture, and the altar of incense,

EXO 31:9  And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver
 and his foot,

EXO 31:10  And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the
 priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,

EXO 31:11  And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place:
 according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

EXO 31:12  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 31:13  Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my
 sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your
 generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.

EXO 31:14  Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every
 one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any
 work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

EXO 31:15  Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of
 rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall
 surely be put to death.

EXO 31:16  Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe
 the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.

EXO 31:17  It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in
 six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he
 rested, and was refreshed.

EXO 31:18  And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with
 him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with
 the finger of God.

EXO 32:1  And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the
 mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him,
 Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man
 that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of
 him.

EXO 32:2  And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are
 in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring
 them unto me.

EXO 32:3  And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their
 ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

EXO 32:4  And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving
 tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O
 Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

EXO 32:5  And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made
 proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.

EXO 32:6  And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings,
 and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and
 rose up to play.

EXO 32:7  And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,
 which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:

EXO 32:8  They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them:
 they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have
 sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have
 brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

EXO 32:9  And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold,
 it is a stiffnecked people:

EXO 32:10  Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against
 them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.

EXO 32:11  And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy
 wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the
 land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?

EXO 32:12  Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he
 bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the
 face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil
 against thy people.

EXO 32:13  Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou
 swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as
 the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto
 your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.

EXO 32:14  And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his
 people.

EXO 32:15  And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables
 of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their
 sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.

EXO 32:16  And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing
 of God, graven upon the tables.

EXO 32:17  And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he
 said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

EXO 32:18  And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,
 neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise
 of them that sing do I hear.

EXO 32:19  And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he
 saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the
 tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.

EXO 32:20  And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
 fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the
 children of Israel drink of it.

EXO 32:21  And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou
 hast brought so great a sin upon them?

EXO 32:22  And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest
 the people, that they are set on mischief.

EXO 32:23  For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for
 as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we
 wot not what is become of him.

EXO 32:24  And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it
 off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out
 this calf.

EXO 32:25  And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made
 them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

EXO 32:26  Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the
 LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered
 themselves together unto him.

EXO 32:27  And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every
 man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the
 camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every
 man his neighbour.

EXO 32:28  And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and
 there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

EXO 32:29  For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even
 every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a
 blessing this day.

EXO 32:30  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people,
 Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure
 I shall make an atonement for your sin.

EXO 32:31  And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have
 sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

EXO 32:32  Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I
 pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

EXO 32:33  And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him
 will I blot out of my book.

EXO 32:34  Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have
 spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless
 in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.

EXO 32:35  And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which
 Aaron made.

EXO 33:1  And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the
 people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land
 which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed
 will I give it:

EXO 33:2  And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the
 Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and
 the Jebusite:

EXO 33:3  Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the
 midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the
 way.

EXO 33:4  And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no
 man did put on him his ornaments.

EXO 33:5  For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye
 are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a
 moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that
 I may know what to do unto thee.

EXO 33:6  And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by
 the mount Horeb.

EXO 33:7  And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar
 off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it
 came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the
 tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.

EXO 33:8  And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that
 all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked
 after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.

EXO 33:9  And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy
 pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord
 talked with Moses.

EXO 33:10  And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
 door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.

EXO 33:11  And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto
 his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the
 son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

EXO 33:12  And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up
 this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet
 thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my
 sight.

EXO 33:13  Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew
 me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and
 consider that this nation is thy people.

EXO 33:14  And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee
 rest.

EXO 33:15  And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not
 up hence.

EXO 33:16  For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found
 grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be
 separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face
 of the earth.

EXO 33:17  And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou
 hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.

EXO 33:18  And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

EXO 33:19  And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I
 will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom
 I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.

EXO 33:20  And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see
 me, and live.

EXO 33:21  And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt
 stand upon a rock:

EXO 33:22  And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will
 put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I
 pass by:

EXO 33:23  And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts:
 but my face shall not be seen.

EXO 34:1  And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto
 the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the
 first tables, which thou brakest.

EXO 34:2  And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount
 Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.

EXO 34:3  And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen
 throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that
 mount.

EXO 34:4  And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose
 up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had
 commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

EXO 34:5  And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and
 proclaimed the name of the LORD.

EXO 34:6  And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD
 God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and
 truth,

EXO 34:7  Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and
 sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the
 fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third
 and to the fourth generation.

EXO 34:8  And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
 worshipped.

EXO 34:9  And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my
 LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon
 our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.

EXO 34:10  And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will
 do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation:
 and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for
 it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.

EXO 34:11  Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out
 before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the
 Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

EXO 34:12  Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants
 of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:

EXO 34:13  But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down
 their groves:

EXO 34:14  For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is
 Jealous, is a jealous God:

EXO 34:15  Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they
 go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call
 thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

EXO 34:16  And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters
 go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their
 gods.

EXO 34:17  Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

EXO 34:18  The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt
 eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for
 in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.

EXO 34:19  All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy
 cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

EXO 34:20  But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if
 thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy
 sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.

EXO 34:21  Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in
 earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

EXO 34:22  And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of
 wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.

EXO 34:23  Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD
 God, the God of Israel.

EXO 34:24  For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
 borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to
 appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.

EXO 34:25  Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither
 shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.

EXO 34:26  The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the
 house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

EXO 34:27  And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the
 tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.

EXO 34:28  And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did
 neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words
 of the covenant, the ten commandments.

EXO 34:29  And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the
 two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount,
 that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.

EXO 34:30  And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the
 skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.

EXO 34:31  And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the
 congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.

EXO 34:32  And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them
 in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.

EXO 34:33  And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his
 face.

EXO 34:34  But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took
 the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children
 of Israel that which he was commanded.

EXO 34:35  And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of
 Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went
 in to speak with him.

EXO 35:1  And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel
 together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath
 commanded, that ye should do them.

EXO 35:2  Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to
 you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein
 shall be put to death.

EXO 35:3  Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath
 day.

EXO 35:4  And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
 saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,

EXO 35:5  Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a
 willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and
 silver, and brass,

EXO 35:6  And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

EXO 35:7  And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

EXO 35:8  And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the
 sweet incense,

EXO 35:9  And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the
 breastplate.

EXO 35:10  And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the
 LORD hath commanded;

EXO 35:11  The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his
 boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,

EXO 35:12  The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail
 of the covering,

EXO 35:13  The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,

EXO 35:14  The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his
 lamps, with the oil for the light,

EXO 35:15  And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and
 the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the
 tabernacle,

EXO 35:16  The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and
 all his vessels, the laver and his foot,

EXO 35:17  The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the
 hanging for the door of the court,

EXO 35:18  The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their
 cords,

EXO 35:19  The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy
 garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister
 in the priest's office.

EXO 35:20  And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the
 presence of Moses.

EXO 35:21  And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one
 whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the
 work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for
 the holy garments.

EXO 35:22  And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing
 hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all
 jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto
 the LORD.

EXO 35:23  And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
 scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers'
 skins, brought them.

EXO 35:24  Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the
 LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work
 of the service, brought it.

EXO 35:25  And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands,
 and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of
 scarlet, and of fine linen.

EXO 35:26  And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats'
 hair.

EXO 35:27  And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the
 ephod, and for the breastplate;

EXO 35:28  And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for
 the sweet incense.

EXO 35:29  The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD,
 every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of
 work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.

EXO 35:30  And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath
 called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
 Judah;

EXO 35:31  And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
 understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;

EXO 35:32  And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in
 brass,

EXO 35:33  And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood,
 to make any manner of cunning work.

EXO 35:34  And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and
 Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

EXO 35:35  Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of
 work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in
 blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even
 of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.

EXO 36:1  Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in
 whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of
 work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had
 commanded.

EXO 36:2  And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in
 whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him
 up to come unto the work to do it:

EXO 36:3  And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of
 Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it
 withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.

EXO 36:4  And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,
 came every man from his work which they made;

EXO 36:5  And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than
 enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.

EXO 36:6  And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed
 throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for
 the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.

EXO 36:7  For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
 it, and too much.

EXO 36:8  And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the
 tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
 scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.

EXO 36:9  The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
 breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.

EXO 36:10  And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other
 five curtains he coupled one unto another.

EXO 36:11  And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
 selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another
 curtain, in the coupling of the second.

EXO 36:12  Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the
 edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held
 one curtain to another.

EXO 36:13  And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto
 another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

EXO 36:14  And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the
 tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

EXO 36:15  The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the
 breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.

EXO 36:16  And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by
 themselves.

EXO 36:17  And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
 in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which
 coupleth the second.

EXO 36:18  And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that
 it might be one.

EXO 36:19  And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a
 covering of badgers' skins above that.

EXO 36:20  And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.

EXO 36:21  The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one
 cubit and a half.

EXO 36:22  One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did
 he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

EXO 36:23  And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south
 side southward:

EXO 36:24  And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two
 sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another
 board for his two tenons.

EXO 36:25  And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north
 corner, he made twenty boards,

EXO 36:26  And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and
 two sockets under another board.

EXO 36:27  And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.

EXO 36:28  And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two
 sides.

EXO 36:29  And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head
 thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.

EXO 36:30  And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets
 of silver, under every board two sockets.

EXO 36:31  And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one
 side of the tabernacle,

EXO 36:32  And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
 tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides
 westward.

EXO 36:33  And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one
 end to the other.

EXO 36:34  And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold
 to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

EXO 36:35  And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined
 linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

EXO 36:36  And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid
 them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets
 of silver.

EXO 36:37  And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and
 purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

EXO 36:38  And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their
 chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.

EXO 37:1  And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was
 the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a
 half the height of it:

EXO 37:2  And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a
 crown of gold to it round about.

EXO 37:3  And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners
 of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other
 side of it.

EXO 37:4  And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

EXO 37:5  And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear
 the ark.

EXO 37:6  And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was
 the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

EXO 37:7  And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he
 them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;

EXO 37:8  One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other
 end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends
 thereof.

EXO 37:9  And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with
 their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the
 mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.

EXO 37:10  And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length
 thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height
 thereof:

 gold round about.

EXO 37:12  Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and
 made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

EXO 37:13  And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the
 four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

EXO 37:14  Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to
 bear the table.

EXO 37:15  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold,
 to bear the table.

EXO 37:16  And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and
 his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold.

EXO 37:17  And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the
 candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his
 flowers, were of the same:

EXO 37:18  And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches
 of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the
 candlestick out of the other side thereof:

EXO 37:19  Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop
 and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and
 a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.

EXO 37:20  And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops,
 and his flowers:

EXO 37:21  And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two
 branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according
 to the six branches going out of it.

EXO 37:22  Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one
 beaten work of pure gold.

EXO 37:23  And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes,
 of pure gold.

EXO 37:24  Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.

EXO 37:25  And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was
 a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was
 the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.

EXO 37:26  And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides
 thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of
 gold round about.

EXO 37:27  And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the
 two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to
 bear it withal.

EXO 37:28  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

EXO 37:29  And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet
 spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

EXO 38:1  And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits
 was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was
 foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.

EXO 38:2  And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns
 thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

 and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof
 made he of brass.

EXO 38:4  And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass
 thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

EXO 38:5  And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be
 places for the staves.

EXO 38:6  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass.

EXO 38:7  And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to
 bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.

EXO 38:8  And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the
 lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation.

EXO 38:9  And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings
 of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:

EXO 38:10  Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the

EXO 38:19  And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their
 hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of
 silver.

EXO 38:20  And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about,
 were of brass.

EXO 38:21  This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
 testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the
 service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.

EXO 38:22  And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
 made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 38:23  And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an
 engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in
 purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

EXO 38:24  All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the
 holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and
 seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

EXO 38:25  And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an
 hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen
 shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

EXO 38:26  A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel
 of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years
 old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred
 and fifty men.

EXO 38:27  And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the
 sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred
 talents, a talent for a socket.

EXO 38:28  And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made
 hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them.

EXO 38:29  And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand
 and four hundred shekels.

EXO 38:30  And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle
 of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and
 all the vessels of the altar,

EXO 38:31  And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the
 court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court
 round about.

EXO 39:1  And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
 service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for
 Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 39:2  And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
 fine twined linen.

EXO 39:3  And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires,
 to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the
 fine linen, with cunning work.

EXO 39:4  They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two
 edges was it coupled together.

EXO 39:5  And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the
 same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and
 scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 39:6  And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as
 signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.

EXO 39:7  And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be
 stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 39:8  And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the
 ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

EXO 39:9  It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the
 length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.

EXO 39:10  And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius,
 a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

EXO 39:11  And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

EXO 39:12  And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

EXO 39:13  And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were
 inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

EXO 39:14  And the stones were according to the names of the children of
 Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet,
 every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.

EXO 39:15  And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen
 work of pure gold.

EXO 39:16  And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the
 two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

EXO 39:17  And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the
 ends of the breastplate.

EXO 39:18  And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two
 ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.

EXO 39:19  And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the
 breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod
 inward.

EXO 39:20  And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides
 of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other
 coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

EXO 39:21  And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the
 ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the
 ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the
 LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 39:22  And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

EXO 39:23  And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an
 habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.

EXO 39:24  And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and
 purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

EXO 39:25  And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the
 pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;

EXO 39:26  A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the
 hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 39:27  And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for
 his sons,

EXO 39:28  And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and
 linen breeches of fine twined linen,

EXO 39:29  And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
 scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 39:30  And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote
 upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

EXO 39:31  And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the
 mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 39:32  Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
 congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that
 the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

EXO 39:33  And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his
 furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his
 sockets,

EXO 39:34  And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of
 badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,

EXO 39:35  The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy
 seat,

EXO 39:36  The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,

EXO 39:37  The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to
 be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,

EXO 39:38  And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
 incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

EXO 39:39  The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his
 vessels, the laver and his foot,

EXO 39:40  The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the
 hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels
 of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,

EXO 39:41  The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy
 garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the
 priest's office.

EXO 39:42  According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of
 Israel made all the work.

EXO 39:43  And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it
 as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.

EXO 40:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

EXO 40:2  On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle
 of the tent of the congregation.

EXO 40:3  And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the
 ark with the vail.

EXO 40:4  And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that
 are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and
 light the lamps thereof.

EXO 40:5  And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark
 of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.

EXO 40:6  And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door
 of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

EXO 40:7  And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
 the altar, and shalt put water therein.

EXO 40:8  And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging
 at the court gate.

EXO 40:9  And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and
 all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it
 shall be holy.

EXO 40:10  And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his
 vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.

EXO 40:11  And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

EXO 40:12  And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

EXO 40:13  And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and
 sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

EXO 40:14  And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

EXO 40:15  And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that
 they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall
 surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.

EXO 40:16  Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did
 he.

EXO 40:17  And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the
 first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

EXO 40:18  And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and
 set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his
 pillars.

EXO 40:19  And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
 covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 40:20  And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves
 on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

EXO 40:21  And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail
 of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded
 Moses.

EXO 40:22  And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side
 of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

EXO 40:23  And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD
 had commanded Moses.

EXO 40:24  And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over
 against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

EXO 40:25  And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded
 Moses.

EXO 40:26  And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before
 the vail:

EXO 40:27  And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 40:28  And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

EXO 40:29  And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle
 of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and
 the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 40:30  And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the
 altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

EXO 40:31  And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet
 thereat:

EXO 40:32  When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came
 near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.

EXO 40:33  And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
 altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.

EXO 40:34  Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory
 of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

EXO 40:35  And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation,
 because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the
 tabernacle.

EXO 40:36  And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
 children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

EXO 40:37  But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the
 day that it was taken up.

EXO 40:38  For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire
 was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all
 their journeys.

GEN 1:1  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

GEN 1:2  And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the
 face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

GEN 1:3  And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

GEN 1:4  And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
 from the darkness.

GEN 1:5  And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And
 the evening and the morning were the first day.

GEN 1:6  And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and
 let it divide the waters from the waters.

GEN 1:7  And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under
 the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

GEN 1:8  And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning
 were the second day.

GEN 1:9  And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
 unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

GEN 1:10  And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the
 waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

GEN 1:11  And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
 seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
 itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

GEN 1:12  And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his
 kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind:
 and God saw that it was good.

GEN 1:13  And the evening and the morning were the third day.

GEN 1:14  And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to
 divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons,
 and for days, and years:

GEN 1:15  And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give
 light upon the earth: and it was so.

GEN 1:16  And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and
 the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

GEN 1:17  And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon
 the earth,

GEN 1:18  And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light
 from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

GEN 1:19  And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

GEN 1:20  And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
 creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open
 firmament of heaven.

GEN 1:21  And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,
 which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged
 fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

GEN 1:22  And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the
 waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

GEN 1:23  And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

GEN 1:24  And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his
 kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and
 it was so.

GEN 1:25  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after
 their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and
 God saw that it was good.

GEN 1:26  And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and
 let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
 air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping
 thing that creepeth upon the earth.

GEN 1:27  So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
 him; male and female created he them.

GEN 1:28  And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
 multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the
 fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing
 that moveth upon the earth.

GEN 1:29  And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which
 is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit
 of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

GEN 1:30  And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to
 every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given
 every green herb for meat: and it was so.

GEN 1:31  And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very
 good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

GEN 2:1  Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
 of them.

GEN 2:2  And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he
 rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

GEN 2:3  And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it
 he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

GEN 2:4  These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they
 were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,

GEN 2:5  And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every
 herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain
 upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.

GEN 2:6  But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face
 of the ground.

GEN 2:7  And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
 into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

GEN 2:8  And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put
 the man whom he had formed.

GEN 2:9  And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is
 pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst
 of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

GEN 2:10  And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it
 was parted, and became into four heads.

GEN 2:11  The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole
 land of Havilah, where there is gold;

GEN 2:12  And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx
 stone.

GEN 2:13  And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
 compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

GEN 2:14  And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth
 toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

GEN 2:15  And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to
 dress it and to keep it.

GEN 2:16  And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
 garden thou mayest freely eat:

GEN 2:17  But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat
 of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

GEN 2:18  And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I
 will make him an help meet for him.

GEN 2:19  And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
 field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he
 would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was
 the name thereof.

GEN 2:20  And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to
 every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for
 him.

GEN 2:21  And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept:
 and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;

GEN 2:22  And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
 woman, and brought her unto the man.

GEN 2:23  And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:
 she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

GEN 2:24  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
 cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

GEN 2:25  And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

GEN 3:1  Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the
 LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall
 not eat of every tree of the garden?

GEN 3:2  And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the
 trees of the garden:

GEN 3:3  But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God
 hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

GEN 3:4  And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

GEN 3:5  For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall
 be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

GEN 3:6  And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
 was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took
 of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her;
 and he did eat.

GEN 3:7  And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
 naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

GEN 3:8  And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the
 cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence
 of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.

GEN 3:9  And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?

GEN 3:10  And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
 because I was naked; and I hid myself.

GEN 3:11  And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten
 of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

GEN 3:12  And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave
 me of the tree, and I did eat.

GEN 3:13  And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast
 done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

GEN 3:14  And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this,
 thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon
 thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

GEN 3:15  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
 seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

GEN 3:16  Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
 conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall
 be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

GEN 3:17  And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of
 thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou
 shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou
 eat of it all the days of thy life;

GEN 3:18  Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt
 eat the herb of the field;

GEN 3:19  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto
 the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust
 shalt thou return.

GEN 3:20  And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of
 all living.

GEN 3:21  Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins,
 and clothed them.

GEN 3:22  And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to
 know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the
 tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

GEN 3:23  Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to
 till the ground from whence he was taken.

GEN 3:24  So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of
 Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way
 of the tree of life.

GEN 4:1  And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
 said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

GEN 4:2  And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep,
 but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

GEN 4:3  And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit
 of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

GEN 4:4  And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the
 fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:

GEN 4:5  But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was
 very wroth, and his countenance fell.

GEN 4:6  And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
 countenance fallen?

GEN 4:7  If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not
 well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou
 shalt rule over him.

GEN 4:8  And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they
 were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.

GEN 4:9  And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I
 know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

GEN 4:10  And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood
 crieth unto me from the ground.

GEN 4:11  And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth
 to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

GEN 4:12  When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee
 her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

GEN 4:13  And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can
 bear.

GEN 4:14  Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth;
 and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
 in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall
 slay me.

GEN 4:15  And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
 vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain,
 lest any finding him should kill him.

GEN 4:16  And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the
 land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

GEN 4:17  And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he
 builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son,
 Enoch.

GEN 4:18  And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael
 begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

GEN 4:19  And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and
 the name of the other Zillah.

GEN 4:20  And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and
 of such as have cattle.

GEN 4:21  And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as
 handle the harp and organ.

GEN 4:22  And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer
 in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.

GEN 4:23  And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye
 wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my
 wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

GEN 4:24  If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
 sevenfold.

GEN 4:25  And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name
 Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom
 Cain slew.

GEN 4:26  And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name
 Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

GEN 5:1  This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God
 created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

GEN 5:2  Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their
 name Adam, in the day when they were created.

GEN 5:3  And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own
 likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:

GEN 5:4  And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred
 years: and he begat sons and daughters:

GEN 5:5  And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years:
 and he died.

GEN 5:6  And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:

GEN 5:7  And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and
 begat sons and daughters:

GEN 5:8  And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he
 died.

GEN 5:9  And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:

GEN 5:10  And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years,
 and begat sons and daughters:

GEN 5:11  And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he
 died.

GEN 5:12  And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:

GEN 5:13  And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty
 years, and begat sons and daughters:

GEN 5:14  And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he
 died.

GEN 5:15  And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:

GEN 5:16  And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty
 years, and begat sons and daughters:

GEN 5:17  And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five
 years: and he died.

GEN 5:18  And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:

GEN 5:19  And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat
 sons and daughters:

GEN 5:20  And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and
 he died.

GEN 5:21  And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:

GEN 5:22  And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred
 years, and begat sons and daughters:

GEN 5:23  And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:

GEN 5:24  And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

GEN 5:25  And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat
 Lamech.

GEN 5:26  And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and
 two years, and begat sons and daughters:

GEN 5:27  And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine
 years: and he died.

GEN 5:28  And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:

GEN 5:29  And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us
 concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the
 LORD hath cursed.

GEN 5:30  And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five
 years, and begat sons and daughters:

GEN 5:31  And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven
 years: and he died.

GEN 5:32  And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and
 Japheth.

GEN 6:1  And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
 earth, and daughters were born unto them,

GEN 6:2  That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and
 they took them wives of all which they chose.

GEN 6:3  And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for
 that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

GEN 6:4  There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
 when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
 children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of
 renown.

GEN 6:5  And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
 that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
 continually.

GEN 6:6  And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it
 grieved him at his heart.

GEN 6:7  And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
 face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls
 of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

GEN 6:8  But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

GEN 6:9  These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in
 his generations, and Noah walked with God.

GEN 6:10  And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

GEN 6:11  The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with
 violence.

GEN 6:12  And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all
 flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

GEN 6:13  And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for
 the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy
 them with the earth.

GEN 6:14  Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
 ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

GEN 6:15  And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length
 of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and
 the height of it thirty cubits.

GEN 6:16  A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish
 it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with
 lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

GEN 6:17  And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to
 destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and
 every thing that is in the earth shall die.

GEN 6:18  But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into
 the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.

GEN 6:19  And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou
 bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and
 female.

GEN 6:20  Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every
 creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto
 thee, to keep them alive.

GEN 6:21  And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt
 gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

GEN 6:22  Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.

GEN 7:1  And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark;
 for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

GEN 7:2  Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and
 his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.

GEN 7:3  Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep
 seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

GEN 7:4  For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty
 days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I
 destroy from off the face of the earth.

GEN 7:5  And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

GEN 7:6  And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon
 the earth.

GEN 7:7  And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with
 him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

GEN 7:8  Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and
 of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

GEN 7:9  There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the
 female, as God had commanded Noah.

GEN 7:10  And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood
 were upon the earth.

GEN 7:11  In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
 seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the
 great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

GEN 7:12  And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

GEN 7:13  In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the
 sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them,
 into the ark;

GEN 7:14  They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their
 kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
 kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.

GEN 7:15  And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh,
 wherein is the breath of life.

GEN 7:16  And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God
 had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

GEN 7:17  And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
 increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.

GEN 7:18  And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth;
 and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

GEN 7:19  And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high
 hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.

GEN 7:20  Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were
 covered.

GEN 7:21  And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of
 cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
 earth, and every man:

GEN 7:22  All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the
 dry land, died.

GEN 7:23  And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
 of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl
 of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained
 alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

GEN 7:24  And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.

GEN 8:1  And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle
 that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and
 the waters asswaged;

GEN 8:2  The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
 stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

GEN 8:3  And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the
 end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.

GEN 8:4  And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the
 month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

GEN 8:5  And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the
 tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains
 seen.

GEN 8:6  And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
 window of the ark which he had made:

GEN 8:7  And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the
 waters were dried up from off the earth.

GEN 8:8  Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated
 from off the face of the ground;

GEN 8:9  But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned
 unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth:
 then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the
 ark.

GEN 8:10  And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove
 out of the ark;

GEN 8:11  And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was
 an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off
 the earth.

GEN 8:12  And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which
 returned not again unto him any more.

GEN 8:13  And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first
 month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the
 earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the
 face of the ground was dry.

GEN 8:14  And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month,
 was the earth dried.

GEN 8:15  And God spake unto Noah, saying,

GEN 8:16  Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons'
 wives with thee.

GEN 8:17  Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all
 flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth
 upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be
 fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

GEN 8:18  And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
 with him:

GEN 8:19  Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever
 creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.

GEN 8:20  And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean
 beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

GEN 8:21  And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart,
 I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the
 imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite
 any more every thing living, as I have done.

GEN 8:22  While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
 heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

GEN 9:1  And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
 fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

GEN 9:2  And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
 of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the
 earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.

GEN 9:3  Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
 green herb have I given you all things.

GEN 9:4  But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye
 not eat.

GEN 9:5  And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of
 every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every
 man's brother will I require the life of man.

GEN 9:6  Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the
 image of God made he man.

GEN 9:7  And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the
 earth, and multiply therein.

GEN 9:8  And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

GEN 9:9  And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed
 after you;

GEN 9:10  And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the
 cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the
 ark, to every beast of the earth.

GEN 9:11  And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be
 cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a
 flood to destroy the earth.

GEN 9:12  And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between
 me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual
 generations:

GEN 9:13  I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
 covenant between me and the earth.

GEN 9:14  And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that
 the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

GEN 9:15  And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and
 every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a
 flood to destroy all flesh.

GEN 9:16  And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I
 may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature
 of all flesh that is upon the earth.

GEN 9:17  And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I
 have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

GEN 9:18  And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and
 Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

GEN 9:19  These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth
 overspread.

GEN 9:20  And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

GEN 9:21  And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
 within his tent.

GEN 9:22  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and
 told his two brethren without.

GEN 9:23  And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their
 shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and
 their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.

GEN 9:24  And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done
 unto him.

GEN 9:25  And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto
 his brethren.

GEN 9:26  And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his
 servant.

GEN 9:27  God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
 and Canaan shall be his servant.

GEN 9:28  And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

GEN 9:29  And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he
 died.

GEN 10:1  Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
 Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

GEN 10:2  The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
 Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

GEN 10:3  And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

GEN 10:4  And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

GEN 10:5  By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every
 one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

GEN 10:6  And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

GEN 10:7  And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and
 Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

GEN 10:8  And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

GEN 10:9  He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as
 Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

GEN 10:10  And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
 Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

GEN 10:11  Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
 city Rehoboth, and Calah,

GEN 10:12  And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

GEN 10:13  And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

GEN 10:14  And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
 Caphtorim.

GEN 10:15  And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,

GEN 10:16  And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

GEN 10:17  And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

GEN 10:18  And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward
 were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

GEN 10:19  And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to
 Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and
 Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

GEN 10:20  These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
 tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

GEN 10:21  Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother
 of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

GEN 10:22  The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and
 Aram.

GEN 10:23  And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

GEN 10:24  And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

GEN 10:25  And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in
 his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.

GEN 10:26  And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

GEN 10:27  And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

GEN 10:28  And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

GEN 10:29  And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
 Joktan.

GEN 10:30  And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount
 of the east.

GEN 10:31  These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
 tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

GEN 10:32  These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,
 in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after
 the flood.

GEN 11:1  And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

GEN 11:2  And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found
 a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

GEN 11:3  And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them
 thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

GEN 11:4  And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top
 may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad
 upon the face of the whole earth.

GEN 11:5  And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the
 children of men builded.

GEN 11:6  And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one
 language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from
 them, which they have imagined to do.

GEN 11:7  Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they
 may not understand one another's speech.

GEN 11:8  So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all
 the earth: and they left off to build the city.

GEN 11:9  Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there
 confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter
 them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

GEN 11:10  These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
 old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

GEN 11:11  And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat
 sons and daughters.

GEN 11:12  And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

GEN 11:13  And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
 years, and begat sons and daughters.

GEN 11:14  And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

GEN 11:15  And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years,
 and begat sons and daughters.

GEN 11:16  And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

GEN 11:17  And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years,
 and begat sons and daughters.

GEN 11:18  And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

GEN 11:19  And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and
 begat sons and daughters.

GEN 11:20  And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

GEN 11:21  And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and
 begat sons and daughters.

GEN 11:22  And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

GEN 11:23  And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat
 sons and daughters.

GEN 11:24  And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

GEN 11:25  And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,
 and begat sons and daughters.

GEN 11:26  And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

GEN 11:27  Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
 Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

GEN 11:28  And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity,
 in Ur of the Chaldees.

GEN 11:29  And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was
 Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the
 father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

GEN 11:30  But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

GEN 11:31  And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's
 son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth
 with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they
 came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

GEN 11:32  And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah
 died in Haran.

GEN 12:1  Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and
 from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew
 thee:

GEN 12:2  And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and
 make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

GEN 12:3  And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth
 thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

GEN 12:4  So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with
 him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.

GEN 12:5  And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all
 their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in
 Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land
 of Canaan they came.

GEN 12:6  And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the
 plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.

GEN 12:7  And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give
 this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto
 him.

GEN 12:8  And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and
 pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there
 he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.

GEN 12:9  And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

GEN 12:10  And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt
 to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.

GEN 12:11  And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that
 he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to
 look upon:

GEN 12:12  Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee,
 that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will
 save thee alive.

GEN 12:13  Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me
 for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

GEN 12:14  And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
 Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

GEN 12:15  The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
 Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

GEN 12:16  And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
 oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and
 camels.

GEN 12:17  And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
 because of Sarai Abram's wife.

GEN 12:18  And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done
 unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?

GEN 12:19  Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me
 to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.

GEN 12:20  And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him
 away, and his wife, and all that he had.

GEN 13:1  And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he
 had, and Lot with him, into the south.

GEN 13:2  And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

GEN 13:3  And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the
 place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;

GEN 13:4  Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first:
 and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

GEN 13:5  And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
 tents.

GEN 13:6  And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
 together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell
 together.

GEN 13:7  And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the
 herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then
 in the land.

GEN 13:8  And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between
 me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.

GEN 13:9  Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
 from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if
 thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

GEN 13:10  And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that
 it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and
 Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou
 comest unto Zoar.

GEN 13:11  Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east:
 and they separated themselves the one from the other.

GEN 13:12  Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities
 of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

GEN 13:13  But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
 exceedingly.

GEN 13:14  And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him,
 Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and
 southward, and eastward, and westward:

GEN 13:15  For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to
 thy seed for ever.

GEN 13:16  And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man
 can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.

GEN 13:17  Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth
 of it; for I will give it unto thee.

GEN 13:18  Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
 Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.

GEN 14:1  And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch
 king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;

GEN 14:2  That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of
 Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of
 Bela, which is Zoar.

GEN 14:3  All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the
 salt sea.

GEN 14:4  Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
 they rebelled.

GEN 14:5  And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were
 with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in
 Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

GEN 14:6  And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the
 wilderness.

GEN 14:7  And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote
 all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in
 Hazezontamar.

GEN 14:8  And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and
 the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is
 Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;

GEN 14:9  With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations,
 and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with
 five.

GEN 14:10  And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom
 and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the
 mountain.

GEN 14:11  And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
 victuals, and went their way.

GEN 14:12  And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and
 his goods, and departed.

GEN 14:13  And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for
 he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of
 Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.

GEN 14:14  And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed
 his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and
 pursued them unto Dan.

GEN 14:15  And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
 night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand
 of Damascus.

GEN 14:16  And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
 brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

GEN 14:17  And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the
 slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley
 of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

GEN 14:18  And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he
 was the priest of the most high God.

GEN 14:19  And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God,
 possessor of heaven and earth:

GEN 14:20  And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies
 into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

GEN 14:21  And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take
 the goods to thyself.

GEN 14:22  And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto
 the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,

GEN 14:23  That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I
 will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made
 Abram rich:

GEN 14:24  Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion
 of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their
 portion.

GEN 15:1  After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision,
 saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.

GEN 15:2  And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
 childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?

GEN 15:3  And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one
 born in my house is mine heir.

GEN 15:4  And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall
 not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall
 be thine heir.

GEN 15:5  And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
 heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto
 him, So shall thy seed be.

GEN 15:6  And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
 righteousness.

GEN 15:7  And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur
 of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

GEN 15:8  And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

GEN 15:9  And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she
 goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and
 a young pigeon.

GEN 15:10  And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and
 laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.

GEN 15:11  And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them
 away.

GEN 15:12  And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and,
 lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

GEN 15:13  And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a
 stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and they shall
 afflict them four hundred years;

GEN 15:14  And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
 afterward shall they come out with great substance.

GEN 15:15  And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a
 good old age.

GEN 15:16  But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the
 iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

GEN 15:17  And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark,
 behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those
 pieces.

GEN 15:18  In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto
 thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great
 river, the river Euphrates:

GEN 15:19  The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

GEN 15:20  And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

GEN 15:21  And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the
 Jebusites.

GEN 16:1  Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid,
 an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

GEN 16:2  And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me
 from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain
 children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

GEN 16:3  And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram
 had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram
 to be his wife.

GEN 16:4  And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that
 she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

GEN 16:5  And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my
 maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised
 in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.

GEN 16:6  But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to
 her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from
 her face.

GEN 16:7  And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the
 wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

GEN 16:8  And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither
 wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

GEN 16:9  And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and
 submit thyself under her hands.

GEN 16:10  And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed
 exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

GEN 16:11  And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child
 and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath
 heard thy affliction.

GEN 16:12  And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and
 every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his
 brethren.

GEN 16:13  And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God
 seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?

GEN 16:14  Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between
 Kadesh and Bered.

GEN 16:15  And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which
 Hagar bare, Ishmael.

GEN 16:16  And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael
 to Abram.

GEN 17:1  And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to
 Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou
 perfect.

GEN 17:2  And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply
 thee exceedingly.

GEN 17:3  And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

GEN 17:4  As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a
 father of many nations.

GEN 17:5  Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall
 be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.

GEN 17:6  And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations
 of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

GEN 17:7  And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
 after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto
 thee, and to thy seed after thee.

GEN 17:8  And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land
 wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
 possession; and I will be their God.

GEN 17:9  And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,
 thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

GEN 17:10  This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy
 seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

GEN 17:11  And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be
 a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

GEN 17:12  And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every
 man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with
 money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.

GEN 17:13  He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money,
 must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an
 everlasting covenant.

GEN 17:14  And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not
 circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my
 covenant.

GEN 17:15  And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not
 call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

GEN 17:16  And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will
 bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of
 her.

GEN 17:17  Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart,
 Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah,
 that is ninety years old, bear?

GEN 17:18  And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!

GEN 17:19  And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou
 shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an
 everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.

GEN 17:20  And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
 him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve
 princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

GEN 17:21  But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear
 unto thee at this set time in the next year.

GEN 17:22  And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

GEN 17:23  And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his
 house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of
 Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame
 day, as God had said unto him.

GEN 17:24  And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised
 in the flesh of his foreskin.

GEN 17:25  And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised
 in the flesh of his foreskin.

GEN 17:26  In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.

GEN 17:27  And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with
 money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

GEN 18:1  And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat
 in the tent door in the heat of the day;

GEN 18:2  And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him:
 and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed
 himself toward the ground,

GEN 18:3  And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not
 away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

GEN 18:4  Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and
 rest yourselves under the tree:

GEN 18:5  And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after
 that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they
 said, So do, as thou hast said.

GEN 18:6  And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready
 quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the
 hearth.

GEN 18:7  And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and
 gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

GEN 18:8  And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and
 set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.

GEN 18:9  And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold,
 in the tent.

GEN 18:10  And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time
 of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the
 tent door, which was behind him.

GEN 18:11  Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it
 ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

GEN 18:12  Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old
 shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

GEN 18:13  And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,
 Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

GEN 18:14  Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will
 return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.

GEN 18:15  Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he
 said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

GEN 18:16  And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
 Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

GEN 18:17  And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;

GEN 18:18  Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
 nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

GEN 18:19  For I know him, that he will command his children and his household
 after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and
 judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of
 him.

GEN 18:20  And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
 great, and because their sin is very grievous;

GEN 18:21  I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
 according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.

GEN 18:22  And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom:
 but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

GEN 18:23  And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
 righteous with the wicked?

GEN 18:24  Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou
 also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are
 therein?

GEN 18:25  That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous
 with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far
 from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

GEN 18:26  And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the
 city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

GEN 18:27  And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to
 speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:

GEN 18:28  Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou
 destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and
 five, I will not destroy it.

GEN 18:29  And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall
 be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.

GEN 18:30  And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
 speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will
 not do it, if I find thirty there.

GEN 18:31  And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
 LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not
 destroy it for twenty's sake.

GEN 18:32  And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but
 this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not
 destroy it for ten's sake.

GEN 18:33  And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with
 Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

GEN 19:1  And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate
 of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with
 his face toward the ground;

GEN 19:2  And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your
 servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise
 up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the
 street all night.

GEN 19:3  And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and
 entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened
 bread, and they did eat.

GEN 19:4  But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom,
 compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every
 quarter:

GEN 19:5  And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which
 came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.

GEN 19:6  And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,

GEN 19:7  And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

GEN 19:8  Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I
 pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes:
 only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of
 my roof.

GEN 19:9  And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came
 in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with
 thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came
 near to break the door.

GEN 19:10  But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house
 to them, and shut to the door.

GEN 19:11  And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
 blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the
 door.

GEN 19:12  And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
 law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city,
 bring them out of this place:

GEN 19:13  For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen
 great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.

GEN 19:14  And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his
 daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy
 this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.

GEN 19:15  And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying,
 Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be
 consumed in the iniquity of the city.

GEN 19:16  And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the
 hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being
 merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.

GEN 19:17  And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that
 he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all
 the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

GEN 19:18  And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:

GEN 19:19  Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast
 magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I
 cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:

GEN 19:20  Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:
 Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.

GEN 19:21  And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this
 thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast
 spoken.

GEN 19:22  Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be
 come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

GEN 19:23  The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

GEN 19:24  Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
 from the LORD out of heaven;

GEN 19:25  And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
 inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

GEN 19:26  But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of
 salt.

GEN 19:27  And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood
 before the LORD:

GEN 19:28  And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land
 of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the
 smoke of a furnace.

GEN 19:29  And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
 that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow,
 when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

GEN 19:30  And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two
 daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave,
 he and his two daughters.

GEN 19:31  And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and
 there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all
 the earth:

GEN 19:32  Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,
 that we may preserve seed of our father.

GEN 19:33  And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn
 went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor
 when she arose.

GEN 19:34  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the
 younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine
 this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed
 of our father.

GEN 19:35  And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
 younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor
 when she arose.

GEN 19:36  Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

GEN 19:37  And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is
 the father of the Moabites unto this day.

GEN 19:38  And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi:
 the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

GEN 20:1  And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and
 dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

GEN 20:2  And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech
 king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

GEN 20:3  But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,
 Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she
 is a man's wife.

GEN 20:4  But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou
 slay also a righteous nation?

GEN 20:5  Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself
 said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my
 hands have I done this.

GEN 20:6  And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this
 in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against
 me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.

GEN 20:7  Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he
 shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know
 thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.

GEN 20:8  Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his
 servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore
 afraid.

GEN 20:9  Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done
 unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on
 my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be
 done.

GEN 20:10  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast
 done this thing?

GEN 20:11  And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not
 in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

GEN 20:12  And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father,
 but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

GEN 20:13  And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's
 house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto
 me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.

GEN 20:14  And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
 womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.

GEN 20:15  And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it
 pleaseth thee.

GEN 20:16  And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand
 pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that
 are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.

GEN 20:17  So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
 wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.

GEN 20:18  For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
 Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

GEN 21:1  And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto
 Sarah as he had spoken.

GEN 21:2  For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the
 set time of which God had spoken to him.

GEN 21:3  And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom
 Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

GEN 21:4  And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God
 had commanded him.

GEN 21:5  And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born
 unto him.

GEN 21:6  And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will
 laugh with me.

GEN 21:7  And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should
 have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.

GEN 21:8  And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast
 the same day that Isaac was weaned.

GEN 21:9  And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto
 Abraham, mocking.

GEN 21:10  Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her
 son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with
 Isaac.

GEN 21:11  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his
 son.

GEN 21:12  And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
 because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said
 unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

GEN 21:13  And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because
 he is thy seed.

GEN 21:14  And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a
 bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the
 child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of
 Beersheba.

GEN 21:15  And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under
 one of the shrubs.

GEN 21:16  And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as
 it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And
 she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.

GEN 21:17  And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to
 Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not;
 for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.

GEN 21:18  Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make
 him a great nation.

GEN 21:19  And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
 went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

GEN 21:20  And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
 wilderness, and became an archer.

GEN 21:21  And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a
 wife out of the land of Egypt.

GEN 21:22  And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the
 chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all
 that thou doest:

GEN 21:23  Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal
 falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the
 kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land
 wherein thou hast sojourned.

GEN 21:24  And Abraham said, I will swear.

GEN 21:25  And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which
 Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

GEN 21:26  And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither
 didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.

GEN 21:27  And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and
 both of them made a covenant.

GEN 21:28  And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

GEN 21:29  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs
 which thou hast set by themselves?

GEN 21:30  And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand,
 that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.

GEN 21:31  Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware
 both of them.

GEN 21:32  Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and
 Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the
 Philistines.

GEN 21:33  And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the
 name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

GEN 21:34  And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

GEN 22:1  And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
 Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.

GEN 22:2  And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
 lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt
 offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

GEN 22:3  And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
 took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for
 the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had
 told him.

GEN 22:4  Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place
 afar off.

GEN 22:5  And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and
 I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.

GEN 22:6  And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon
 Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went
 both of them together.

GEN 22:7  And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he
 said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where
 is the lamb for a burnt offering?

GEN 22:8  And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
 offering: so they went both of them together.

GEN 22:9  And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
 built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
 son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

GEN 22:10  And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his
 son.

GEN 22:11  And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said,
 Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

GEN 22:12  And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any
 thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not
 withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

GEN 22:13  And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a
 ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and
 offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.

GEN 22:14  And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is
 said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.

GEN 22:15  And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the
 second time,

GEN 22:16  And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou
 hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:

GEN 22:17  That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
 multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon
 the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;

GEN 22:18  And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
 because thou hast obeyed my voice.

GEN 22:19  So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went
 together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

GEN 22:20  And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham,
 saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;

GEN 22:21  Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of
 Aram,

GEN 22:22  And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

GEN 22:23  And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,
 Abraham's brother.

GEN 22:24  And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and
 Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

GEN 23:1  And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were
 the years of the life of Sarah.

GEN 23:2  And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of
 Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

GEN 23:3  And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of
 Heth, saying,

GEN 23:4  I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a
 buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

GEN 23:5  And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

GEN 23:6  Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of
 our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his
 sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.

GEN 23:7  And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,
 even to the children of Heth.

GEN 23:8  And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should
 bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son
 of Zohar,

GEN 23:9  That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is
 in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me
 for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.

GEN 23:10  And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite
 answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that
 went in at the gate of his city, saying,

GEN 23:11  Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is
 therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it
 thee: bury thy dead.

GEN 23:12  And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

GEN 23:13  And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land,
 saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee
 money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.

GEN 23:14  And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

GEN 23:15  My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of
 silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.

GEN 23:16  And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the
 silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred
 shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.

GEN 23:17  And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before
 Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were
 in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure

GEN 23:18  Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of
 Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

GEN 23:19  And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the
 field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.

GEN 23:20  And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto
 Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.

GEN 24:1  And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had
 blessed Abraham in all things.

GEN 24:2  And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
 over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:

GEN 24:3  And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the
 God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the
 daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

GEN 24:4  But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife
 unto my son Isaac.

GEN 24:5  And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
 willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto
 the land from whence thou camest?

GEN 24:6  And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son
 thither again.

GEN 24:7  The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and
 from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me,
 saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before
 thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.

GEN 24:8  And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt
 be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.

GEN 24:9  And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
 master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

GEN 24:10  And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
 departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and
 went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.

GEN 24:11  And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of
 water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw
 water.

GEN 24:12  And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me
 good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.

GEN 24:13  Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the
 men of the city come out to draw water:

GEN 24:14  And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let
 down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say,
 Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou
 hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast
 shewed kindness unto my master.

GEN 24:15  And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
 Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor,
 Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

GEN 24:16  And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any
 man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and
 came up.

GEN 24:17  And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
 drink a little water of thy pitcher.

GEN 24:18  And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
 pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

GEN 24:19  And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water
 for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

GEN 24:20  And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
 again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.

GEN 24:21  And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD
 had made his journey prosperous or not.

GEN 24:22  And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man
 took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her
 hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

GEN 24:23  And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there
 room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

GEN 24:24  And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
 Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

GEN 24:25  She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
 enough, and room to lodge in.

GEN 24:26  And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

GEN 24:27  And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath
 not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the
 way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.

GEN 24:28  And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
 things.

GEN 24:29  And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out
 unto the man, unto the well.

GEN 24:30  And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his
 sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying,
 Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood
 by the camels at the well.

GEN 24:31  And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest
 thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.

GEN 24:32  And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and
 gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the
 men's feet that were with him.

GEN 24:33  And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not
 eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

GEN 24:34  And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

GEN 24:35  And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great:
 and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and
 menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.

GEN 24:36  And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old:
 and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

GEN 24:37  And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to
 my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:

GEN 24:38  But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and
 take a wife unto my son.

GEN 24:39  And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow
 me.

GEN 24:40  And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his
 angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son
 of my kindred, and of my father's house:

GEN 24:41  Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my
 kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.

GEN 24:42  And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master
 Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

GEN 24:43  Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass,
 that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I
 pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;

GEN 24:44  And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy
 camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my
 master's son.

GEN 24:45  And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came
 forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and
 drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.

GEN 24:46  And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and
 said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made
 the camels drink also.

GEN 24:47  And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
 said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I
 put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.

GEN 24:48  And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the
 LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my
 master's brother's daughter unto his son.

GEN 24:49  And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me:
 and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.

GEN 24:50  Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from
 the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

GEN 24:51  Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy
 master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.

GEN 24:52  And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words,
 he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.

GEN 24:53  And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
 gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and
 to her mother precious things.

GEN 24:54  And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and
 tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away
 unto my master.

GEN 24:55  And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a
 few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

GEN 24:56  And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered
 my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

GEN 24:57  And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.

GEN 24:58  And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this
 man? And she said, I will go.

GEN 24:59  And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
 Abraham's servant, and his men.

GEN 24:60  And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be
 thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate
 of those which hate them.

GEN 24:61  And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels,
 and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.

GEN 24:62  And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
 in the south country.

GEN 24:63  And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he
 lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.

GEN 24:64  And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted
 off the camel.

GEN 24:65  For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh
 in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore
 she took a vail, and covered herself.

GEN 24:66  And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

GEN 24:67  And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
 Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted
 after his mother's death.

GEN 25:1  Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

GEN 25:2  And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and
 Ishbak, and Shuah.

GEN 25:3  And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
 Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

GEN 25:4  And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and
 Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

GEN 25:5  And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

GEN 25:6  But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave
 gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward,
 unto the east country.

GEN 25:7  And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived,
 an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

GEN 25:8  Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old
 man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

GEN 25:9  And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,
 in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;

GEN 25:10  The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was
 Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

GEN 25:11  And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his
 son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

GEN 25:12  Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar
 the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

GEN 25:13  And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,
 according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and
 Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

GEN 25:14  And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

GEN 25:15  Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

GEN 25:16  These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their
 towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

GEN 25:17  And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
 thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered
 unto his people.

GEN 25:18  And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou
 goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.

GEN 25:19  And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat
 Isaac:

GEN 25:20  And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the
 daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.

GEN 25:21  And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren:
 and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

GEN 25:22  And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it
 be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.

GEN 25:23  And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two
 manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall
 be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.

GEN 25:24  And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were
 twins in her womb.

GEN 25:25  And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they
 called his name Esau.

GEN 25:26  And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
 Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years
 old when she bare them.

GEN 25:27  And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
 field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

GEN 25:28  And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah
 loved Jacob.

GEN 25:29  And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was
 faint:

GEN 25:30  And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
 pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.

GEN 25:31  And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

GEN 25:32  And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit
 shall this birthright do to me?

GEN 25:33  And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he
 sold his birthright unto Jacob.

GEN 25:34  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat
 and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.

GEN 26:1  And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was
 in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines
 unto Gerar.

GEN 26:2  And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;
 dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

GEN 26:3  Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee;
 for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will
 perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;

GEN 26:4  And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will
 give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations
 of the earth be blessed;

GEN 26:5  Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
 commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

GEN 26:6  And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

GEN 26:7  And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is
 my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men
 of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.

GEN 26:8  And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
 Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and,
 behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

GEN 26:9  And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy
 wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because
 I said, Lest I die for her.

GEN 26:10  And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the
 people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought
 guiltiness upon us.

GEN 26:11  And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this
 man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

GEN 26:12  Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an
 hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.

GEN 26:13  And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became
 very great:

GEN 26:14  For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great
 store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

GEN 26:15  For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days
 of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with
 earth.

GEN 26:16  And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
 mightier than we.

GEN 26:17  And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of
 Gerar, and dwelt there.

GEN 26:18  And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged
 in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after
 the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his
 father had called them.

GEN 26:19  And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of
 springing water.

GEN 26:20  And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying,
 The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they
 strove with him.

GEN 26:21  And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
 called the name of it Sitnah.

GEN 26:22  And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that
 they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now
 the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.

GEN 26:23  And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

GEN 26:24  And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the
 God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless
 thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.

GEN 26:25  And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
 LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.

GEN 26:26  Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
 friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

GEN 26:27  And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate
 me, and have sent me away from you?

GEN 26:28  And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we
 said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let
 us make a covenant with thee;

GEN 26:29  That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we
 have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou
 art now the blessed of the LORD.

GEN 26:30  And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

GEN 26:31  And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another:
 and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

GEN 26:32  And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and
 told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We
 have found water.

GEN 26:33  And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba
 unto this day.

GEN 26:34  And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
 daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the
 Hittite:

GEN 26:35  Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

GEN 27:1  And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,
 so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him,
 My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.

GEN 27:2  And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:

GEN 27:3  Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy
 bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

GEN 27:4  And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I
 may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

GEN 27:5  And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went
 to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

GEN 27:6  And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy
 father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

GEN 27:7  Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless
 thee before the LORD before my death.

GEN 27:8  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
 command thee.

GEN 27:9  Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the
 goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:

GEN 27:10  And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he
 may bless thee before his death.

GEN 27:11  And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a
 hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

GEN 27:12  My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a
 deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.

GEN 27:13  And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only
 obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

GEN 27:14  And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his
 mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

GEN 27:15  And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were
 with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:

GEN 27:16  And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and
 upon the smooth of his neck:

GEN 27:17  And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared,
 into the hand of her son Jacob.

GEN 27:18  And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here
 am I; who art thou, my son?

GEN 27:19  And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have
 done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my
 venison, that thy soul may bless me.

GEN 27:20  And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so
 quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.

GEN 27:21  And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel
 thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

GEN 27:22  And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and
 said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.

GEN 27:23  And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
 brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

GEN 27:24  And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

GEN 27:25  And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
 venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he
 did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.

GEN 27:26  And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my
 son.

GEN 27:27  And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his
 raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell
 of a field which the LORD hath blessed:

GEN 27:28  Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the
 earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

GEN 27:29  Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over
 thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one
 that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.

GEN 27:30  And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing
 Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his
 father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

GEN 27:31  And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
 father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's
 venison, that thy soul may bless me.

GEN 27:32  And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am
 thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

GEN 27:33  And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that
 hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou
 camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.

GEN 27:34  And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great
 and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O
 my father.

GEN 27:35  And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy
 blessing.

GEN 27:36  And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted
 me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath
 taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for
 me?

GEN 27:37  And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy
 lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn
 and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

GEN 27:38  And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my
 father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his
 voice, and wept.

GEN 27:39  And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
 dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from
 above;

GEN 27:40  And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and
 it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt
 break his yoke from off thy neck.

GEN 27:41  And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father
 blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father
 are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.

GEN 27:42  And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she
 sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother
 Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.

GEN 27:43  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my
 brother to Haran;

GEN 27:44  And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;

GEN 27:45  Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that
 which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence:
 why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?

GEN 27:46  And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the
 daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as
 these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?

GEN 28:1  And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said
 unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

GEN 28:2  Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father;
 and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother's
 brother.

GEN 28:3  And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply
 thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

GEN 28:4  And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with
 thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which
 God gave unto Abraham.

GEN 28:5  And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son
 of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.

GEN 28:6  When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to
 Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave
 him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan;

GEN 28:7  And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to
 Padanaram;

GEN 28:8  And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his
 father;

GEN 28:9  Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had
 Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be
 his wife.

GEN 28:10  And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

GEN 28:11  And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night,
 because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put
 them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.

GEN 28:12  And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top
 of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and
 descending on it.

GEN 28:13  And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of
 Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest,
 to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

GEN 28:14  And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt
 spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the
 south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be
 blessed.

GEN 28:15  And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
 whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not
 leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.

GEN 28:16  And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is
 in this place; and I knew it not.

GEN 28:17  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is
 none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

GEN 28:18  And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he
 had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the
 top of it.

GEN 28:19  And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that
 city was called Luz at the first.

GEN 28:20  And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep
 me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put
 on,

GEN 28:21  So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the
 LORD be my God:

GEN 28:22  And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house:
 and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

GEN 29:1  Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people
 of the east.

GEN 29:2  And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were
 three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the
 flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.

GEN 29:3  And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone
 from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon
 the well's mouth in his place.

GEN 29:4  And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said,
 Of Haran are we.

GEN 29:5  And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said,
 We know him.

GEN 29:6  And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and,
 behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

GEN 29:7  And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
 cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.

GEN 29:8  And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
 together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water
 the sheep.

GEN 29:9  And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's
 sheep; for she kept them.

GEN 29:10  And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his
 mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob
 went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock
 of Laban his mother's brother.

GEN 29:11  And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

GEN 29:12  And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he
 was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.

GEN 29:13  And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
 sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and
 brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.

GEN 29:14  And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he
 abode with him the space of a month.

GEN 29:15  And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest
 thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?

GEN 29:16  And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the
 name of the younger was Rachel.

GEN 29:17  Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.

GEN 29:18  And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for
 Rachel thy younger daughter.

GEN 29:19  And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I
 should give her to another man: abide with me.

GEN 29:20  And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him
 but a few days, for the love he had to her.

GEN 29:21  And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
 fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

GEN 29:22  And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a
 feast.

GEN 29:23  And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
 daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

GEN 29:24  And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
 handmaid.

GEN 29:25  And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and
 he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with
 thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?

GEN 29:26  And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the
 younger before the firstborn.

GEN 29:27  Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
 which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

GEN 29:28  And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his
 daughter to wife also.

GEN 29:29  And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her
 maid.

GEN 29:30  And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than
 Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

GEN 29:31  And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but
 Rachel was barren.

GEN 29:32  And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben:
 for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore
 my husband will love me.

GEN 29:33  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD
 hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she
 called his name Simeon.

GEN 29:34  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time
 will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:
 therefore was his name called Levi.

GEN 29:35  And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I
 praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.

GEN 30:1  And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied
 her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.

GEN 30:2  And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in
 God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

GEN 30:3  And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall
 bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.

GEN 30:4  And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto
 her.

GEN 30:5  And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

GEN 30:6  And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
 voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.

GEN 30:7  And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second
 son.

GEN 30:8  And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
 sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.

GEN 30:9  When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
 maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.

GEN 30:10  And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

GEN 30:11  And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.

GEN 30:12  And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

GEN 30:13  And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed:
 and she called his name Asher.

GEN 30:14  And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes
 in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to
 Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.

GEN 30:15  And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my
 husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel
 said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.

GEN 30:16  And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to
 meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee
 with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.

GEN 30:17  And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the
 fifth son.

GEN 30:18  And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my
 maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

GEN 30:19  And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

GEN 30:20  And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my
 husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his
 name Zebulun.

GEN 30:21  And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

GEN 30:22  And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her
 womb.

GEN 30:23  And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my
 reproach:

GEN 30:24  And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me
 another son.

GEN 30:25  And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said
 unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my
 country.

GEN 30:26  Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and
 let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

GEN 30:27  And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in
 thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath
 blessed me for thy sake.

GEN 30:28  And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

GEN 30:29  And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how
 thy cattle was with me.

GEN 30:30  For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now
 increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming:
 and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?

GEN 30:31  And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not
 give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and
 keep thy flock.

GEN 30:32  I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all
 the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the
 sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my
 hire.

GEN 30:33  So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it
 shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and
 spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted
 stolen with me.

GEN 30:34  And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.

GEN 30:35  And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
 spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one
 that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them
 into the hand of his sons.

GEN 30:36  And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob
 fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

GEN 30:37  And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
 chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear
 which was in the rods.

GEN 30:38  And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the
 gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they
 should conceive when they came to drink.

GEN 30:39  And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle
 ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

GEN 30:40  And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks
 toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put
 his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.

GEN 30:41  And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive,
 that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that
 they might conceive among the rods.

GEN 30:42  But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler
 were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

GEN 30:43  And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
 maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

GEN 31:1  And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away
 all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten
 all this glory.

GEN 31:2  And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not
 toward him as before.

GEN 31:3  And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers,
 and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

GEN 31:4  And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
 flock,

GEN 31:5  And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not
 toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.

GEN 31:6  And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

GEN 31:7  And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but
 God suffered him not to hurt me.

GEN 31:8  If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle
 bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then
 bare all the cattle ringstraked.

GEN 31:9  Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to
 me.

GEN 31:10  And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I
 lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped
 upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.

GEN 31:11  And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I
 said, Here am I.

GEN 31:12  And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which
 leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen
 all that Laban doeth unto thee.

GEN 31:13  I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where
 thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and
 return unto the land of thy kindred.

GEN 31:14  And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any
 portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

GEN 31:15  Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath
 quite devoured also our money.

GEN 31:16  For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is
 ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.

GEN 31:17  Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;

GEN 31:18  And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had
 gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to
 go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

GEN 31:19  And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images
 that were her father's.

GEN 31:20  And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told
 him not that he fled.

GEN 31:21  So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the
 river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

GEN 31:22  And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

GEN 31:23  And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days'
 journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

GEN 31:24  And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto
 him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

GEN 31:25  Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the
 mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.

GEN 31:26  And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen
 away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with
 the sword?

GEN 31:27  Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and
 didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with
 songs, with tabret, and with harp?

GEN 31:28  And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast
 now done foolishly in so doing.

GEN 31:29  It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your
 father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not
 to Jacob either good or bad.

GEN 31:30  And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
 longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?

GEN 31:31  And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I
 said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.

GEN 31:32  With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our
 brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob
 knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

GEN 31:33  And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the
 two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's
 tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

GEN 31:34  Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
 furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them
 not.

GEN 31:35  And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I
 cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he
 searched but found not the images.

GEN 31:36  And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and
 said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly
 pursued after me?

GEN 31:37  Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all
 thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that
 they may judge betwixt us both.

GEN 31:38  This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats
 have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.

GEN 31:39  That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the
 loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or
 stolen by night.

GEN 31:40  Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by
 night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

GEN 31:41  Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen
 years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast
 changed my wages ten times.

GEN 31:42  Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of
 Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath
 seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee
 yesternight.

GEN 31:43  And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
 daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my
 cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto
 these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?

GEN 31:44  Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let
 it be for a witness between me and thee.

GEN 31:45  And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

GEN 31:46  And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
 stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.

GEN 31:47  And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.

GEN 31:48  And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day.
 Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

GEN 31:49  And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we
 are absent one from another.

GEN 31:50  If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other
 wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me
 and thee.

GEN 31:51  And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar,
 which I have cast betwixt me and thee:

GEN 31:52  This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not
 pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and
 this pillar unto me, for harm.

GEN 31:53  The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father,
 judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.

GEN 31:54  Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren
 to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.

GEN 31:55  And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his
 daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.

GEN 32:1  And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

GEN 32:2  And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called
 the name of that place Mahanaim.

GEN 32:3  And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the
 land of Seir, the country of Edom.

GEN 32:4  And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau;
 Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there
 until now:

GEN 32:5  And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
 womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy
 sight.

GEN 32:6  And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother
 Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.

GEN 32:7  Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the
 people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two
 bands;

GEN 32:8  And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the
 other company which is left shall escape.

GEN 32:9  And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father
 Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy
 kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

GEN 32:10  I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the
 truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed
 over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.

GEN 32:11  Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand
 of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with
 the children.

GEN 32:12  And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as
 the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

GEN 32:13  And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to
 his hand a present for Esau his brother;

GEN 32:14  Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and
 twenty rams,

GEN 32:15  Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,
 twenty she asses, and ten foals.

GEN 32:16  And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by
 themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space
 betwixt drove and drove.

GEN 32:17  And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth
 thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and
 whose are these before thee?

GEN 32:18  Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present
 sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.

GEN 32:19  And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed
 the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find
 him.

GEN 32:20  And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he
 said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward
 I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

GEN 32:21  So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night
 in the company.

GEN 32:22  And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
 womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

GEN 32:23  And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that
 he had.

GEN 32:24  And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until
 the breaking of the day.

GEN 32:25  And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the
 hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he
 wrestled with him.

GEN 32:26  And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will
 not let thee go, except thou bless me.

GEN 32:27  And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

GEN 32:28  And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for
 as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

GEN 32:29  And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And
 he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him
 there.

GEN 32:30  And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God
 face to face, and my life is preserved.

GEN 32:31  And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted
 upon his thigh.

GEN 32:32  Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank,
 which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the
 hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.

GEN 33:1  And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and
 with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto
 Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.

GEN 33:2  And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and
 her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

GEN 33:3  And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven
 times, until he came near to his brother.

GEN 33:4  And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and
 kissed him: and they wept.

GEN 33:5  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and
 said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath
 graciously given thy servant.

GEN 33:6  Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they
 bowed themselves.

GEN 33:7  And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and
 after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.

GEN 33:8  And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he
 said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

GEN 33:9  And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto
 thyself.

GEN 33:10  And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy
 sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy
 face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.

GEN 33:11  Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God
 hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged
 him, and he took it.

GEN 33:12  And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go
 before thee.

GEN 33:13  And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
 tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should
 overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

GEN 33:14  Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will
 lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children
 be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.

GEN 33:15  And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are
 with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my
 lord.

GEN 33:16  So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

GEN 33:17  And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made
 booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

GEN 33:18  And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of
 Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.

GEN 33:19  And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at
 the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of
 money.

GEN 33:20  And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.

GEN 34:1  And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out
 to see the daughters of the land.

GEN 34:2  And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country,
 saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.

GEN 34:3  And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the
 damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

GEN 34:4  And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel
 to wife.

GEN 34:5  And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons
 were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were
 come.

GEN 34:6  And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with
 him.

GEN 34:7  And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and
 the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly
 in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.

GEN 34:8  And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem
 longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.

GEN 34:9  And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and
 take our daughters unto you.

GEN 34:10  And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell
 and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

GEN 34:11  And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find
 grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.

GEN 34:12  Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye
 shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

GEN 34:13  And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
 deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:

GEN 34:14  And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister
 to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:

GEN 34:15  But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that
 every male of you be circumcised;

GEN 34:16  Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your
 daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.

GEN 34:17  But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we
 take our daughter, and we will be gone.

GEN 34:18  And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

GEN 34:19  And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
 delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of
 his father.

GEN 34:20  And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and
 communed with the men of their city, saying,

GEN 34:21  These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the
 land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them;
 let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our
 daughters.

GEN 34:22  Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be
 one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.

GEN 34:23  Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast
 of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with
 us.

GEN 34:24  And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out
 of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out
 of the gate of his city.

GEN 34:25  And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two
 of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his
 sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.

GEN 34:26  And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
 sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

GEN 34:27  The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because
 they had defiled their sister.

GEN 34:28  They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that
 which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

GEN 34:29  And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives
 took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.

GEN 34:30  And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to
 stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the
 Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together
 against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

GEN 34:31  And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?

GEN 35:1  And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and
 make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from
 the face of Esau thy brother.

GEN 35:2  Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him,
 Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your
 garments:

GEN 35:3  And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar
 unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the
 way which I went.

GEN 35:4  And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their
 hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them
 under the oak which was by Shechem.

GEN 35:5  And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that
 were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

GEN 35:6  So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
 Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

GEN 35:7  And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because
 there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

GEN 35:8  But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel
 under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.

GEN 35:9  And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and
 blessed him.

GEN 35:10  And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be
 called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name
 Israel.

GEN 35:11  And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply;
 a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out
 of thy loins;

GEN 35:12  And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give
 it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

GEN 35:13  And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.

GEN 35:14  And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,
 even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured
 oil thereon.

GEN 35:15  And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,
 Bethel.

GEN 35:16  And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to
 come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

GEN 35:17  And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife
 said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.

GEN 35:18  And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died)
 that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.

GEN 35:19  And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is
 Bethlehem.

GEN 35:20  And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
 Rachel's grave unto this day.

GEN 35:21  And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.

GEN 35:22  And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben
 went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the
 sons of Jacob were twelve:

GEN 35:23  The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and
 Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

GEN 35:24  The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

GEN 35:25  And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

GEN 35:26  And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are
 the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

GEN 35:27  And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of
 Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

GEN 35:28  And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

GEN 35:29  And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his
 people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

GEN 36:1  Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

GEN 36:2  Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of
 Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon
 the Hivite;

GEN 36:3  And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

GEN 36:4  And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

GEN 36:5  And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons
 of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

GEN 36:6  And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the
 persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his
 substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country
 from the face of his brother Jacob.

GEN 36:7  For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and
 the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their
 cattle.

GEN 36:8  Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

GEN 36:9  And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in
 mount Seir:

GEN 36:10  These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife
 of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

GEN 36:11  And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and
 Kenaz.

GEN 36:12  And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to
 Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

GEN 36:13  And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and
 Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

GEN 36:14  And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the
 daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and
 Korah.

GEN 36:15  These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
 firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,

GEN 36:16  Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that
 came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.

GEN 36:17  And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah,
 duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land
 of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

GEN 36:18  And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke
 Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter
 of Anah, Esau's wife.

GEN 36:19  These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.

GEN 36:20  These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
 Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

GEN 36:21  And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the
 Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

GEN 36:22  And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister
 was Timna.

GEN 36:23  And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and
 Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

GEN 36:24  And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was
 that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of
 Zibeon his father.

GEN 36:25  And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the
 daughter of Anah.

GEN 36:26  And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
 Ithran, and Cheran.

GEN 36:27  The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

GEN 36:28  The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

GEN 36:29  These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
 Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,

GEN 36:30  Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came
 of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

GEN 36:31  And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before
 there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

GEN 36:32  And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city
 was Dinhabah.

GEN 36:33  And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his
 stead.

GEN 36:34  And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his
 stead.

GEN 36:35  And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the
 field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.

GEN 36:36  And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

GEN 36:37  And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his
 stead.

GEN 36:38  And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.

GEN 36:39  And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
 stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was
 Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.

GEN 36:40  And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according
 to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke
 Alvah, duke Jetheth,

GEN 36:41  Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

GEN 36:42  Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

GEN 36:43  Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according
 to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father
 of the Edomites.

GEN 37:1  And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the
 land of Canaan.

GEN 37:2  These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years
 old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons
 of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph
 brought unto his father their evil report.

GEN 37:3  Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was
 the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.

GEN 37:4  And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all
 his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.

GEN 37:5  And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they
 hated him yet the more.

GEN 37:6  And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
 dreamed:

GEN 37:7  For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf
 arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round
 about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

GEN 37:8  And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or
 shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for
 his dreams, and for his words.

GEN 37:9  And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said,
 Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and
 the eleven stars made obeisance to me.

GEN 37:10  And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father
 rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed?
 Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves
 to thee to the earth?

GEN 37:11  And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.

GEN 37:12  And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

GEN 37:13  And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in
 Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.

GEN 37:14  And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy
 brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him
 out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

GEN 37:15  And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the
 field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

GEN 37:16  And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they
 feed their flocks.

GEN 37:17  And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let
 us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in
 Dothan.

GEN 37:18  And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
 them, they conspired against him to slay him.

GEN 37:19  And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

GEN 37:20  Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some
 pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see
 what will become of his dreams.

GEN 37:21  And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and
 said, Let us not kill him.

GEN 37:22  And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit
 that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him
 out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.

GEN 37:23  And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that
 they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;

GEN 37:24  And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was
 empty, there was no water in it.

GEN 37:25  And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and
 looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their
 camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.

GEN 37:26  And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our
 brother, and conceal his blood?

GEN 37:27  Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand
 be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were
 content.

GEN 37:28  Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
 lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for
 twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.

GEN 37:29  And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the
 pit; and he rent his clothes.

GEN 37:30  And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and
 I, whither shall I go?

GEN 37:31  And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and
 dipped the coat in the blood;

GEN 37:32  And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their
 father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat
 or no.

GEN 37:33  And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath
 devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

GEN 37:34  And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and
 mourned for his son many days.

GEN 37:35  And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but
 he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave
 unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.

GEN 37:36  And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of
 Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

GEN 38:1  And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his
 brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

GEN 38:2  And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was
 Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

GEN 38:3  And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

GEN 38:4  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name
 Onan.

GEN 38:5  And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name
 Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

GEN 38:6  And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.

GEN 38:7  And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and
 the LORD slew him.

GEN 38:8  And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry
 her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

GEN 38:9  And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass,
 when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground,
 lest that he should give seed to his brother.

GEN 38:10  And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew
 him also.

GEN 38:11  Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy
 father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure
 he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's
 house.

GEN 38:12  And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and
 Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and
 his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

GEN 38:13  And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to
 Timnath to shear his sheep.

GEN 38:14  And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with
 a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to
 Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to
 wife.

GEN 38:15  When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had
 covered her face.

GEN 38:16  And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let
 me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And
 she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?

GEN 38:17  And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said,
 Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

GEN 38:18  And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
 signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave
 it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

GEN 38:19  And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put
 on the garments of her widowhood.

GEN 38:20  And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to
 receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.

GEN 38:21  Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot,
 that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this
 place.

GEN 38:22  And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the
 men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.

GEN 38:23  And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I
 sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

GEN 38:24  And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
 Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also,
 behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and
 let her be burnt.

GEN 38:25  When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying,
 By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray
 thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.

GEN 38:26  And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous
 than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again
 no more.

GEN 38:27  And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins
 were in her womb.

GEN 38:28  And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his
 hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying,
 This came out first.

GEN 38:29  And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his
 brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be
 upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.

GEN 38:30  And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon
 his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

GEN 39:1  And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of
 Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the
 Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.

GEN 39:2  And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was
 in the house of his master the Egyptian.

GEN 39:3  And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made
 all that he did to prosper in his hand.

GEN 39:4  And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made
 him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.

GEN 39:5  And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in
 his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's
 house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he
 had in the house, and in the field.

GEN 39:6  And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought
 he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and
 well favoured.

GEN 39:7  And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast
 her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

GEN 39:8  But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master
 wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he
 hath to my hand;

GEN 39:9  There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back
 any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this
 great wickedness, and sin against God?

GEN 39:10  And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he
 hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

GEN 39:11  And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house
 to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.

GEN 39:12  And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left
 his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

GEN 39:13  And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in
 her hand, and was fled forth,

GEN 39:14  That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them,
 saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto
 me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:

GEN 39:15  And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and
 cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.

GEN 39:16  And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

GEN 39:17  And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew
 servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:

GEN 39:18  And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left
 his garment with me, and fled out.

GEN 39:19  And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife,
 which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me;
 that his wrath was kindled.

GEN 39:20  And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place
 where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.

GEN 39:21  But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him
 favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

GEN 39:22  And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the
 prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the
 doer of it.

GEN 39:23  The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his
 hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it
 to prosper.

GEN 40:1  And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king
 of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.

GEN 40:2  And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief
 of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

GEN 40:3  And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,
 into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

GEN 40:4  And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served
 them: and they continued a season in ward.

GEN 40:5  And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one
 night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and
 the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.

GEN 40:6  And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
 them, and, behold, they were sad.

GEN 40:7  And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his
 lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?

GEN 40:8  And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no
 interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong
 to God? tell me them, I pray you.

GEN 40:9  And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my
 dream, behold, a vine was before me;

GEN 40:10  And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it
 budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth
 ripe grapes:

GEN 40:11  And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed
 them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

GEN 40:12  And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The
 three branches are three days:

GEN 40:13  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore
 thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand,
 after the former manner when thou wast his butler.

GEN 40:14  But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness,
 I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out
 of this house:

GEN 40:15  For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and
 here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

GEN 40:16  When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said
 unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets
 on my head:

GEN 40:17  And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for
 Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.

GEN 40:18  And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof:
 The three baskets are three days:

GEN 40:19  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off
 thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from
 off thee.

GEN 40:20  And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,
 that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the
 chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.

GEN 40:21  And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he
 gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

GEN 40:22  But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

GEN 40:23  Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

GEN 41:1  And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
 dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

GEN 41:2  And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine
 and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

GEN 41:3  And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river,
 ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink
 of the river.

GEN 41:4  And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well
 favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

GEN 41:5  And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of
 corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

GEN 41:6  And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up
 after them.

GEN 41:7  And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And
 Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

GEN 41:8  And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and
 he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
 thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could
 interpret them unto Pharaoh.

GEN 41:9  Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my
 faults this day:

GEN 41:10  Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
 captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

GEN 41:11  And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man
 according to the interpretation of his dream.

GEN 41:12  And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the
 captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams;
 to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

GEN 41:13  And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
 restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

GEN 41:14  Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily
 out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came
 in unto Pharaoh.

GEN 41:15  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is
 none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst
 understand a dream to interpret it.

GEN 41:16  And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give
 Pharaoh an answer of peace.

GEN 41:17  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the
 bank of the river:

GEN 41:18  And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed
 and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

GEN 41:19  And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill
 favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for
 badness:

GEN 41:20  And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven
 fat kine:

GEN 41:21  And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had
 eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I
 awoke.

GEN 41:22  And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk,
 full and good:

GEN 41:23  And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east
 wind, sprung up after them:

GEN 41:24  And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto
 the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.

GEN 41:25  And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath
 shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

GEN 41:26  The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are
 seven years: the dream is one.

GEN 41:27  And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are
 seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be
 seven years of famine.

GEN 41:28  This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is
 about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

GEN 41:29  Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the
 land of Egypt:

GEN 41:30  And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the
 plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume
 the land;

GEN 41:31  And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that
 famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

GEN 41:32  And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because
 the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

GEN 41:33  Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set
 him over the land of Egypt.

GEN 41:34  Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and
 take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.

GEN 41:35  And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and
 lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.

GEN 41:36  And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years
 of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not
 through the famine.

GEN 41:37  And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of
 all his servants.

GEN 41:38  And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this
 is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

GEN 41:39  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all
 this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

GEN 41:40  Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all
 my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

GEN 41:41  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land
 of Egypt.

GEN 41:42  And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
 Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold
 chain about his neck;

GEN 41:43  And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they
 cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of
 Egypt.

GEN 41:44  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall
 no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

GEN 41:45  And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to
 wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out
 over all the land of Egypt.

GEN 41:46  And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of
 Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout
 all the land of Egypt.

GEN 41:47  And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
 handfuls.

GEN 41:48  And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
 in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the
 field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.

GEN 41:49  And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he
 left numbering; for it was without number.

GEN 41:50  And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came,
 which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.

GEN 41:51  And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said
 he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.

GEN 41:52  And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me
 to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

GEN 41:53  And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt,
 were ended.

GEN 41:54  And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had
 said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was
 bread.

GEN 41:55  And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to
 Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph;
 what he saith to you, do.

GEN 41:56  And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened
 all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore
 in the land of Egypt.

GEN 41:57  And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because
 that the famine was so sore in all lands.

GEN 42:1  Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his
 sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

GEN 42:2  And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get
 you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.

GEN 42:3  And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

GEN 42:4  But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for
 he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

GEN 42:5  And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for
 the famine was in the land of Canaan.

GEN 42:6  And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to
 all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down
 themselves before him with their faces to the earth.

GEN 42:7  And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself
 strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence
 come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

GEN 42:8  And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

GEN 42:9  And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said
 unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

GEN 42:10  And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
 servants come.

GEN 42:11  We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no
 spies.

GEN 42:12  And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye
 are come.

GEN 42:13  And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man
 in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our
 father, and one is not.

GEN 42:14  And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying,
 Ye are spies:

GEN 42:15  Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go
 forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

GEN 42:16  Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be
 kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in
 you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

GEN 42:17  And he put them all together into ward three days.

GEN 42:18  And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I
 fear God:

GEN 42:19  If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of
 your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:

GEN 42:20  But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be
 verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

GEN 42:21  And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our
 brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we
 would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

GEN 42:22  And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do
 not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his
 blood is required.

GEN 42:23  And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto
 them by an interpreter.

GEN 42:24  And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned
 to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound
 him before their eyes.

GEN 42:25  Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore
 every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and
 thus did he unto them.

GEN 42:26  And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

GEN 42:27  And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the
 inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.

GEN 42:28  And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is
 even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying
 one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?

GEN 42:29  And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and
 told him all that befell unto them; saying,

GEN 42:30  The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took
 us for spies of the country.

GEN 42:31  And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

GEN 42:32  We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
 youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

GEN 42:33  And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I
 know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take
 food for the famine of your households, and be gone:

GEN 42:34  And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye
 are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your
 brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

GEN 42:35  And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every
 man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father
 saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

GEN 42:36  And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my
 children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away:
 all these things are against me.

GEN 42:37  And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I
 bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee
 again.

GEN 42:38  And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is
 dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye
 go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

GEN 43:1  And the famine was sore in the land.

GEN 43:2  And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had
 brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little
 food.

GEN 43:3  And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto
 us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

GEN 43:4  If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee
 food:

GEN 43:5  But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said
 unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

GEN 43:6  And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the
 man whether ye had yet a brother?

GEN 43:7  And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our
 kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we
 told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that
 he would say, Bring your brother down?

GEN 43:8  And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we
 will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also
 our little ones.

GEN 43:9  I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I
 bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame
 for ever:

GEN 43:10  For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second
 time.

GEN 43:11  And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do
 this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the
 man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts,
 and almonds:

GEN 43:12  And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought
 again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure
 it was an oversight:

GEN 43:13  Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

GEN 43:14  And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send
 away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am
 bereaved.

GEN 43:15  And the men took that present, and they took double money in their
 hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before
 Joseph.

GEN 43:16  And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his
 house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall
 dine with me at noon.

GEN 43:17  And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into
 Joseph's house.

GEN 43:18  And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's
 house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at
 the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and
 fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

GEN 43:19  And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
 communed with him at the door of the house,

GEN 43:20  And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:

GEN 43:21  And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our
 sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money
 in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.

GEN 43:22  And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we
 cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

GEN 43:23  And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of
 your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he
 brought Simeon out unto them.

GEN 43:24  And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
 water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.

GEN 43:25  And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for
 they heard that they should eat bread there.

GEN 43:26  And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was
 in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.

GEN 43:27  And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
 well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

GEN 43:28  And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is
 yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.

GEN 43:29  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
 mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto
 me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

GEN 43:30  And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother:
 and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.

GEN 43:31  And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and
 said, Set on bread.

GEN 43:32  And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and
 for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the
 Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination
 unto the Egyptians.

GEN 43:33  And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
 birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled
 one at another.

GEN 43:34  And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
 Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and
 were merry with him.

GEN 44:1  And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's
 sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his
 sack's mouth.

GEN 44:2  And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the
 youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph
 had spoken.

GEN 44:3  As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and
 their asses.

GEN 44:4  And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph
 said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake
 them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?

GEN 44:5  Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he
 divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

GEN 44:6  And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

GEN 44:7  And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God
 forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:

GEN 44:8  Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought
 again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of
 thy lord's house silver or gold?

GEN 44:9  With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we
 also will be my lord's bondmen.

GEN 44:10  And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with
 whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.

GEN 44:11  Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and
 opened every man his sack.

GEN 44:12  And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest:
 and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

GEN 44:13  Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
 returned to the city.

GEN 44:14  And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet
 there: and they fell before him on the ground.

GEN 44:15  And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot
 ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

GEN 44:16  And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?
 or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy
 servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom
 the cup is found.

GEN 44:17  And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose
 hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in
 peace unto your father.

GEN 44:18  Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
 servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger
 burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.

GEN 44:19  My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

GEN 44:20  And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child
 of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left
 of his mother, and his father loveth him.

GEN 44:21  And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I
 may set mine eyes upon him.

GEN 44:22  And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he
 should leave his father, his father would die.

GEN 44:23  And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come
 down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

GEN 44:24  And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we
 told him the words of my lord.

GEN 44:25  And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

GEN 44:26  And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us,
 then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest
 brother be with us.

GEN 44:27  And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me
 two sons:

GEN 44:28  And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
 pieces; and I saw him not since:

GEN 44:29  And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall
 bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

GEN 44:30  Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be
 not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;

GEN 44:31  It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us,
 that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy
 servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

GEN 44:32  For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If
 I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.

GEN 44:33  Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad
 a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.

GEN 44:34  For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest
 peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.

GEN 45:1  Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by
 him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man
 with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.

GEN 45:2  And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.

GEN 45:3  And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet
 live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his
 presence.

GEN 45:4  And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And
 they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into
 Egypt.

GEN 45:5  Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold
 me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.

GEN 45:6  For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there
 are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.

GEN 45:7  And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
 earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

GEN 45:8  So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made
 me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all
 the land of Egypt.

GEN 45:9  Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy
 son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:

GEN 45:10  And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near
 unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks,
 and thy herds, and all that thou hast:

GEN 45:11  And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of
 famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to
 poverty.

GEN 45:12  And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,
 that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

GEN 45:13  And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all
 that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.

GEN 45:14  And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin
 wept upon his neck.

GEN 45:15  Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after
 that his brethren talked with him.

GEN 45:16  And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's
 brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.

GEN 45:17  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;
 lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

GEN 45:18  And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I
 will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the
 land.

GEN 45:19  Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land
 of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and
 come.

GEN 45:20  Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is
 your's.

GEN 45:21  And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
 according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.

GEN 45:22  To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin
 he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.

GEN 45:23  And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with
 the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and
 meat for his father by the way.

GEN 45:24  So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto
 them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

GEN 45:25  And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto
 Jacob their father,

GEN 45:26  And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over
 all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.

GEN 45:27  And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto
 them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the
 spirit of Jacob their father revived:

GEN 45:28  And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go
 and see him before I die.

GEN 46:1  And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
 Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

GEN 46:2  And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,
 Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

GEN 46:3  And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down
 into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

GEN 46:4  I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring
 thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

GEN 46:5  And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried
 Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons
 which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

GEN 46:6  And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten
 in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:

GEN 46:7  His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons'
 daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.

GEN 46:8  And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
 Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

GEN 46:9  And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

GEN 46:10  And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and
 Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

GEN 46:11  And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

GEN 46:12  And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and
 Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez
 were Hezron and Hamul.

GEN 46:13  And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.

GEN 46:14  And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

GEN 46:15  These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram,
 with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were
 thirty and three.

GEN 46:16  And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and
 Arodi, and Areli.

GEN 46:17  And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and
 Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.

GEN 46:18  These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his
 daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

GEN 46:19  The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

GEN 46:20  And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim,
 which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.

GEN 46:21  And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
 Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

GEN 46:22  These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the
 souls were fourteen.

GEN 46:23  And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

GEN 46:24  And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.

GEN 46:25  These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
 daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.

GEN 46:26  All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his
 loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;

GEN 46:27  And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two
 souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were
 threescore and ten.

GEN 46:28  And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto
 Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

GEN 46:29  And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his
 father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his
 neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

GEN 46:30  And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy
 face, because thou art yet alive.

GEN 46:31  And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I
 will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's
 house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;

GEN 46:32  And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle;
 and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.

GEN 46:33  And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall
 say, What is your occupation?

GEN 46:34  That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from
 our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell
 in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the
 Egyptians.

GEN 47:1  Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
 brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come
 out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.

GEN 47:2  And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them
 unto Pharaoh.

GEN 47:3  And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they
 said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.

GEN 47:4  They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we
 come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is
 sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants
 dwell in the land of Goshen.

GEN 47:5  And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren
 are come unto thee:

GEN 47:6  The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy
 father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if
 thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my
 cattle.

GEN 47:7  And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh:
 and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

GEN 47:8  And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

GEN 47:9  And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage
 are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of
 my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of
 my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

GEN 47:10  And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

GEN 47:11  And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
 possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of
 Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

GEN 47:12  And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
 father's household, with bread, according to their families.

GEN 47:13  And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very
 sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason
 of the famine.

GEN 47:14  And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of
 Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph
 brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

GEN 47:15  And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
 Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why
 should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.

GEN 47:16  And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your
 cattle, if money fail.

GEN 47:17  And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them
 bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the
 herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for
 that year.

GEN 47:18  When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and
 said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent;
 my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight
 of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:

GEN 47:19  Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy
 us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh:
 and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not
 desolate.

GEN 47:20  And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
 Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them:
 so the land became Pharaoh's.

GEN 47:21  And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the
 borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

GEN 47:22  Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a
 portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh
 gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.

GEN 47:23  Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day
 and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the
 land.

GEN 47:24  And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the
 fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the
 field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for
 your little ones.

GEN 47:25  And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the
 sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

GEN 47:26  And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that
 Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only,
 which became not Pharaoh's.

GEN 47:27  And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and
 they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.

GEN 47:28  And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole
 age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

GEN 47:29  And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son
 Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I
 pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury
 me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

GEN 47:30  But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
 Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast
 said.

GEN 47:31  And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed
 himself upon the bed's head.

GEN 48:1  And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold,
 thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

GEN 48:2  And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
 thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.

GEN 48:3  And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz
 in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

GEN 48:4  And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply
 thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land
 to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.

GEN 48:5  And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee
 in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben
 and Simeon, they shall be mine.

GEN 48:6  And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and
 shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.

GEN 48:7  And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land
 of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto
 Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.

GEN 48:8  And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

GEN 48:9  And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath
 given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I
 will bless them.

GEN 48:10  Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see.
 And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.

GEN 48:11  And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and,
 lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

GEN 48:12  And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed
 himself with his face to the earth.

GEN 48:13  And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's
 left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and
 brought them near unto him.

GEN 48:14  And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's
 head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding
 his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.

GEN 48:15  And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham
 and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,

GEN 48:16  The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let
 my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and
 let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

GEN 48:17  And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the
 head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to
 remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

GEN 48:18  And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the
 firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

GEN 48:19  And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he
 also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger
 brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of
 nations.

GEN 48:20  And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless,
 saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before
 Manasseh.

GEN 48:21  And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with
 you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

GEN 48:22  Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which
 I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

GEN 49:1  And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together,
 that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.

GEN 49:2  Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken
 unto Israel your father.

GEN 49:3  Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my
 strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

GEN 49:4  Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to
 thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.

GEN 49:5  Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their
 habitations.

GEN 49:6  O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine
 honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their
 selfwill they digged down a wall.

GEN 49:7  Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was
 cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

GEN 49:8  Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be
 in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before
 thee.

GEN 49:9  Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he
 stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him
 up?

GEN 49:10  The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
 his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people
 be.

GEN 49:11  Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice
 vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:

GEN 49:12  His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

GEN 49:13  Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an
 haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

GEN 49:14  Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

GEN 49:15  And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant;
 and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.

GEN 49:16  Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

GEN 49:17  Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth
 the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

GEN 49:18  I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

GEN 49:19  Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.

GEN 49:20  Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
 dainties.

GEN 49:21  Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

GEN 49:22  Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose
 branches run over the wall:

GEN 49:23  The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:

GEN 49:24  But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made
 strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the
 shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

GEN 49:25  Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the
 Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings
 of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:

GEN 49:26  The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my
 progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on
 the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate
 from his brethren.

GEN 49:27  Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the
 prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

GEN 49:28  All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their
 father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing
 he blessed them.

GEN 49:29  And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my
 people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron
 the Hittite,

GEN 49:30  In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
 Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron
 the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.

GEN 49:31  There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried
 Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

GEN 49:32  The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from
 the children of Heth.

GEN 49:33  And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered
 up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his
 people.

GEN 50:1  And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed
 him.

GEN 50:2  And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
 father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

GEN 50:3  And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days
 of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and
 ten days.

GEN 50:4  And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the
 house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I
 pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

GEN 50:5  My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have
 digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore
 let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.

GEN 50:6  And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made
 thee swear.

GEN 50:7  And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the
 servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land
 of Egypt,

GEN 50:8  And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's
 house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left
 in the land of Goshen.

GEN 50:9  And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a
 very great company.

GEN 50:10  And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
 Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he
 made a mourning for his father seven days.

GEN 50:11  And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
 mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the
 Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond
 Jordan.

GEN 50:12  And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

GEN 50:13  For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him
 in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field
 for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

GEN 50:14  And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that
 went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

GEN 50:15  And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they
 said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the
 evil which we did unto him.

GEN 50:16  And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
 command before he died, saying,

GEN 50:17  So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass
 of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray
 thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And
 Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

GEN 50:18  And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they
 said, Behold, we be thy servants.

GEN 50:19  And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?

GEN 50:20  But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto
 good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.

GEN 50:21  Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.
 And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

GEN 50:22  And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph
 lived an hundred and ten years.

GEN 50:23  And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the
 children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's
 knees.

GEN 50:24  And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit
 you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham,
 to Isaac, and to Jacob.

GEN 50:25  And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will
 surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

GEN 50:26  So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
 embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

LEV 1:1  And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
 tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

LEV 1:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of
 you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the
 cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.

LEV 1:3  If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male
 without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door
 of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.

LEV 1:4  And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it
 shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

LEV 1:5  And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,
 Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon
 the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

LEV 1:6  And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.

LEV 1:7  And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and
 lay the wood in order upon the fire:

LEV 1:8  And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the
 fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:

LEV 1:9  But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest
 shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by
 fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

LEV 1:10  And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the
 goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.

LEV 1:11  And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the
 LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about
 upon the altar.

LEV 1:12  And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and
 the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is
 upon the altar:

LEV 1:13  But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest
 shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an
 offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

LEV 1:14  And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls,
 then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.

LEV 1:15  And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his
 head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at
 the side of the altar:

LEV 1:16  And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it
 beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:

LEV 1:17  And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide
 it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that
 is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a
 sweet savour unto the LORD.

LEV 2:1  And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering
 shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense
 thereon:

LEV 2:2  And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take
 thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all
 the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon
 the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:

LEV 2:3  And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons':
 it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.

LEV 2:4  And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it
 shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened
 wafers anointed with oil.

LEV 2:5  And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of
 fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

LEV 2:6  Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat
 offering.

LEV 2:7  And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it
 shall be made of fine flour with oil.

LEV 2:8  And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things
 unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it
 unto the altar.

LEV 2:9  And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
 thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of
 a sweet savour unto the LORD.

LEV 2:10  And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his
 sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.

LEV 2:11  No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made
 with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering
 of the LORD made by fire.

LEV 2:12  As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the
 LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.

LEV 2:13  And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt;
 neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking
 from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.

LEV 2:14  And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD,
 thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn
 dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.

LEV 2:15  And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a
 meat offering.

LEV 2:16  And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn
 thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it
 is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

LEV 3:1  And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it
 of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without
 blemish before the LORD.

LEV 3:2  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it
 at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the
 priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

LEV 3:3  And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering
 made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the
 fat that is upon the inwards,

LEV 3:4  And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the
 flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take
 away.

LEV 3:5  And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice,
 which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire,
 of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

LEV 3:6  And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be
 of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.

LEV 3:7  If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the
 LORD.

LEV 3:8  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it
 before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle
 the blood thereof round about upon the altar.

LEV 3:9  And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering
 made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he
 take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all
 the fat that is upon the inwards,

LEV 3:10  And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
 flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take
 away.

LEV 3:11  And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the
 offering made by fire unto the LORD.

LEV 3:12  And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the
 LORD.

LEV 3:13  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the
 tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the
 blood thereof upon the altar round about.

LEV 3:14  And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by
 fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that
 is upon the inwards,

LEV 3:15  And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
 flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take
 away.

LEV 3:16  And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the
 offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the LORD's.

LEV 3:17  It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all
 your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.

LEV 4:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 4:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through
 ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which
 ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:

LEV 4:3  If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the
 people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock
 without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.

LEV 4:4  And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's
 head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

LEV 4:5  And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and
 bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

LEV 4:6  And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the
 blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.

LEV 4:7  And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
 of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the
 congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom
 of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle
 of the congregation.

LEV 4:8  And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin
 offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the
 inwards,

LEV 4:9  And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
 flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take
 away,

LEV 4:10  As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace
 offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt
 offering.

LEV 4:11  And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and
 with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

LEV 4:12  Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a
 clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with
 fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.

LEV 4:13  And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and
 the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat
 against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should
 not be done, and are guilty;

LEV 4:14  When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the
 congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before
 the tabernacle of the congregation.

LEV 4:15  And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the
 head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before
 the LORD.

LEV 4:16  And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood
 to the tabernacle of the congregation:

LEV 4:17  And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and
 sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

LEV 4:18  And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which
 is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall
 pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering,
 which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

LEV 4:19  And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.

LEV 4:20  And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin
 offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement
 for them, and it shall be forgiven them.

LEV 4:21  And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him
 as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.

LEV 4:22  When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against
 any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should
 not be done, and is guilty;

LEV 4:23  Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he
 shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:

LEV 4:24  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it
 in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin
 offering.

LEV 4:25  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his
 finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall
 pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.

LEV 4:26  And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the
 sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him
 as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

LEV 4:27  And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he
 doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things
 which ought not to be done, and be guilty;

LEV 4:28  Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he
 shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for
 his sin which he hath sinned.

LEV 4:29  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay
 the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

LEV 4:30  And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and
 put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all
 the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.

LEV 4:31  And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away
 from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon
 the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an
 atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.

LEV 4:32  And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female
 without blemish.

LEV 4:33  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay
 it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.

LEV 4:34  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his
 finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall
 pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:

LEV 4:35  And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is
 taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall
 burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the
 LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath
 committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

LEV 5:1  And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness,
 whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall
 bear his iniquity.

LEV 5:2  Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an
 unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean
 creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and
 guilty.

LEV 5:3  Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be
 that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth
 of it, then he shall be guilty.

LEV 5:4  Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do
 good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid
 from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.

LEV 5:5  And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that
 he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:

LEV 5:6  And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin
 which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,
 for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning
 his sin.

LEV 5:7  And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his
 trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,
 unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.

LEV 5:8  And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is
 for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall
 not divide it asunder:

LEV 5:9  And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side
 of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom
 of the altar: it is a sin offering.

LEV 5:10  And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the
 manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he
 hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.

LEV 5:11  But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,
 then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah
 of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall
 he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.

LEV 5:12  Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his
 handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according
 to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin offering.

LEV 5:13  And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin
 that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the
 remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.

LEV 5:14  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 5:15  If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy
 things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram
 without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,
 after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

LEV 5:16  And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy
 thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and
 the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass
 offering, and it shall be forgiven him.

LEV 5:17  And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden
 to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he
 guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

LEV 5:18  And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy
 estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall
 make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist
 it not, and it shall be forgiven him.

LEV 5:19  It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the
 LORD.

LEV 6:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 6:2  If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto
 his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or
 in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;

LEV 6:3  Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and
 sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:

LEV 6:4  Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall
 restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath
 deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost
 thing which he found,

LEV 6:5  Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore
 it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it
 unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering.

LEV 6:6  And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without
 blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto
 the priest:

LEV 6:7  And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it
 shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing
 therein.

LEV 6:8  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 6:9  Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt
 offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all
 night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

LEV 6:10  And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches
 shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath
 consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside
 the altar.

LEV 6:11  And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and
 carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

LEV 6:12  And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be
 put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the
 burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the
 peace offerings.

LEV 6:13  The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.

LEV 6:14  And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall
 offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

LEV 6:15  And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
 offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the
 meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the
 memorial of it, unto the LORD.

LEV 6:16  And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
 unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the
 tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

LEV 6:17  It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for
 their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin
 offering, and as the trespass offering.

LEV 6:18  All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall
 be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the
 LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.

LEV 6:19  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 6:20  This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer
 unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of
 fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half
 thereof at night.

LEV 6:21  In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt
 bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a
 sweet savour unto the LORD.

LEV 6:22  And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer
 it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.

LEV 6:23  For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it
 shall not be eaten.

LEV 6:24  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 6:25  Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin
 offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin
 offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.

LEV 6:26  The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place
 shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.

LEV 6:27  Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when
 there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash
 that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.

LEV 6:28  But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if
 it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.

LEV 6:29  All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.

LEV 6:30  And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the
 tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall
 be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

LEV 7:1  Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.

LEV 7:2  In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the
 trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon
 the altar.

LEV 7:3  And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat
 that covereth the inwards,

LEV 7:4  And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the
 flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
 take away:

LEV 7:5  And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by
 fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.

LEV 7:6  Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten
 in the holy place: it is most holy.

LEV 7:7  As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law
 for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.

LEV 7:8  And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest
 shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.

LEV 7:9  And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is
 dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth
 it.

LEV 7:10  And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the
 sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

LEV 7:11  And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
 shall offer unto the LORD.

LEV 7:12  If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
 sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened
 wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

LEV 7:13  Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread
 with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.

LEV 7:14  And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave
 offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the
 blood of the peace offerings.

LEV 7:15  And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
 thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not
 leave any of it until the morning.

LEV 7:16  But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
 offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and
 on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:

LEV 7:17  But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
 shall be burnt with fire.

LEV 7:18  And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be
 eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be
 imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul
 that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.

LEV 7:19  And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it
 shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat
 thereof.

LEV 7:20  But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
 offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even
 that soul shall be cut off from his people.

LEV 7:21  Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
 uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean
 thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
 pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

LEV 7:22  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 7:23  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of
 fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

LEV 7:24  And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that
 which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no
 wise eat of it.

LEV 7:25  For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
 offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be
 cut off from his people.

LEV 7:26  Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of
 beast, in any of your dwellings.

LEV 7:27  Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul
 shall be cut off from his people.

LEV 7:28  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 7:29  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the
 sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto
 the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.

LEV 7:30  His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the
 fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a
 wave offering before the LORD.

LEV 7:31  And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast
 shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

LEV 7:32  And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave
 offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

LEV 7:33  He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace
 offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.

LEV 7:34  For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
 children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have
 given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from
 among the children of Israel.

LEV 7:35  This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing
 of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when
 he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office;

LEV 7:36  Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel,
 in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their
 generations.

LEV 7:37  This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and
 of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations,
 and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;

LEV 7:38  Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he
 commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD,
 in the wilderness of Sinai.

LEV 8:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 8:2  Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing
 oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of
 unleavened bread;

LEV 8:3  And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation.

LEV 8:4  And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered
 together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

LEV 8:5  And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD
 commanded to be done.

LEV 8:6  And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.

LEV 8:7  And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and
 clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with
 the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.

LEV 8:8  And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate
 the Urim and the Thummim.

LEV 8:9  And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his
 forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded
 Moses.

LEV 8:10  And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all
 that was therein, and sanctified them.

LEV 8:11  And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the
 altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.

LEV 8:12  And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed
 him, to sanctify him.

LEV 8:13  And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded
 them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.

LEV 8:14  And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his
 sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.

LEV 8:15  And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns
 of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured
 the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make
 reconciliation upon it.

LEV 8:16  And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above
 the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the
 altar.

LEV 8:17  But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with
 fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

LEV 8:18  And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons
 laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

LEV 8:19  And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round
 about.

LEV 8:20  And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the
 pieces, and the fat.

LEV 8:21  And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the
 whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an
 offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

LEV 8:22  And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and
 his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

LEV 8:23  And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon
 the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon
 the great toe of his right foot.

LEV 8:24  And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip
 of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the
 great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
 round about.

LEV 8:25  And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the
 inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their
 fat, and the right shoulder:

LEV 8:26  And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD,
 he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and
 put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:

LEV 8:27  And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and
 waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.

LEV 8:28  And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar
 upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an
 offering made by fire unto the LORD.

LEV 8:29  And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before
 the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD
 commanded Moses.

LEV 8:30  And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon
 the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his
 sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his
 garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.

LEV 8:31  And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door
 of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that
 is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons
 shall eat it.

LEV 8:32  And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn
 with fire.

LEV 8:33  And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end:
 for seven days shall he consecrate you.

LEV 8:34  As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make
 an atonement for you.

LEV 8:35  Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that
 ye die not: for so I am commanded.

LEV 8:36  So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the
 hand of Moses.

LEV 9:1  And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his
 sons, and the elders of Israel;

LEV 9:2  And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and
 a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.

LEV 9:3  And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a
 kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first
 year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;

LEV 9:4  Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the
 LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear
 unto you.

LEV 9:5  And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle
 of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the
 LORD.

LEV 9:6  And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye
 should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.

LEV 9:7  And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin
 offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for
 the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for
 them; as the LORD commanded.

LEV 9:8  Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin
 offering, which was for himself.

LEV 9:9  And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his
 finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out
 the blood at the bottom of the altar:

LEV 9:10  But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin
 offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.

LEV 9:11  And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.

LEV 9:12  And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him
 the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.

LEV 9:13  And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces
 thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.

LEV 9:14  And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the
 burnt offering on the altar.

LEV 9:15  And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was
 the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the
 first.

LEV 9:16  And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the
 manner.

LEV 9:17  And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and
 burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.

LEV 9:18  He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
 offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the
 blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,

LEV 9:19  And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which
 covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:

LEV 9:20  And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the
 altar:

LEV 9:21  And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave
 offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

LEV 9:22  And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and
 came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and
 peace offerings.

LEV 9:23  And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and
 came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all
 the people.

LEV 9:24  And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the
 altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they
 shouted, and fell on their faces.

LEV 10:1  And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his
 censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange
 fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.

LEV 10:2  And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they
 died before the LORD.

LEV 10:3  Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I
 will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I
 will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.

LEV 10:4  And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle
 of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the
 sanctuary out of the camp.

LEV 10:5  So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp;
 as Moses had said.

LEV 10:6  And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his
 sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and
 lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house
 of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.

LEV 10:7  And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And
 they did according to the word of Moses.

LEV 10:8  And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,

LEV 10:9  Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee,
 when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be
 a statute for ever throughout your generations:

LEV 10:10  And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between
 unclean and clean;

LEV 10:11  And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which
 the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

LEV 10:12  And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his
 sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings
 of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it
 is most holy:

LEV 10:13  And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and
 thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am
 commanded.

LEV 10:14  And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
 place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy
 due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace
 offerings of the children of Israel.

LEV 10:15  The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
 offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the
 LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever;
 as the LORD hath commanded.

LEV 10:16  And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
 behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of
 Aaron which were left alive, saying,

LEV 10:17  Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place,
 seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the
 congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?

LEV 10:18  Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye
 should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.

LEV 10:19  And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their
 sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have
 befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been
 accepted in the sight of the LORD?

LEV 10:20  And when Moses heard that, he was content.

LEV 11:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

LEV 11:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which
 ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.

LEV 11:3  Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the
 cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

LEV 11:4  Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or
 of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but
 divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

LEV 11:5  And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof;
 he is unclean unto you.

LEV 11:6  And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof;
 he is unclean unto you.

LEV 11:7  And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he
 cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

LEV 11:8  Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not
 touch; they are unclean to you.

LEV 11:9  These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath
 fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye
 eat.

LEV 11:10  And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
 rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is
 in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:

LEV 11:11  They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat
 of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.

LEV 11:12  Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an
 abomination unto you.

LEV 11:13  And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the
 fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the
 ossifrage, and the ospray,

LEV 11:14  And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

LEV 11:15  Every raven after his kind;

LEV 11:16  And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after
 his kind,

LEV 11:17  And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

LEV 11:18  And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

LEV 11:19  And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the
 bat.

LEV 11:20  All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination
 unto you.

LEV 11:21  Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon
 all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;

LEV 11:22  Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the
 bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the
 grasshopper after his kind.

LEV 11:23  But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be
 an abomination unto you.

LEV 11:24  And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase
 of them shall be unclean until the even.

LEV 11:25  And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his
 clothes, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 11:26  The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not
 clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that
 toucheth them shall be unclean.

LEV 11:27  And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that
 go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase
 shall be unclean until the even.

LEV 11:28  And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and
 be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.

LEV 11:29  These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that
 creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his
 kind,

LEV 11:30  And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the
 snail, and the mole.

LEV 11:31  These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch
 them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.

LEV 11:32  And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it
 shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or
 sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into
 water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

LEV 11:33  And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever
 is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

LEV 11:34  Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh
 shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall
 be unclean.

LEV 11:35  And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be
 unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down:
 for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.

LEV 11:36  Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water,
 shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.

LEV 11:37  And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is
 to be sown, it shall be clean.

LEV 11:38  But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase
 fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

LEV 11:39  And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the
 carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

LEV 11:40  And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and
 be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash
 his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 11:41  And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an
 abomination; it shall not be eaten.

LEV 11:42  Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four,
 or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the
 earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.

LEV 11:43  Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that
 creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should
 be defiled thereby.

LEV 11:44  For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves,
 and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with
 any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

LEV 11:45  For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to
 be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.

LEV 11:46  This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living
 creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon
 the earth:

LEV 11:47  To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between
 the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.

LEV 12:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 12:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived
 seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according
 to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

LEV 12:3  And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.

LEV 12:4  And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and
 thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary,
 until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

LEV 12:5  But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as
 in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying
 threescore and six days.

LEV 12:6  And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a
 daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and
 a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:

LEV 12:7  Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her;
 and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for
 her that hath born a male or a female.

LEV 12:8  And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two
 turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other
 for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she
 shall be clean.

LEV 13:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

LEV 13:2  When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or
 bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy;
 then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the
 priests:

LEV 13:3  And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and
 when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be
 deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest
 shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.

LEV 13:4  If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be
 not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the
 priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:

LEV 13:5  And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the
 plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then
 the priest shall shut him up seven days more:

LEV 13:6  And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold,
 if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the
 priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his
 clothes, and be clean.

LEV 13:7  But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath
 been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest
 again.

LEV 13:8  And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
 skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.

LEV 13:9  When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto
 the priest;

LEV 13:10  And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white
 in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh
 in the rising;

LEV 13:11  It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall
 pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.

LEV 13:12  And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover
 all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot,
 wheresoever the priest looketh;

LEV 13:13  Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have
 covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it
 is all turned white: he is clean.

LEV 13:14  But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

LEV 13:15  And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be
 unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

LEV 13:16  Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall
 come unto the priest;

LEV 13:17  And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned
 into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague:
 he is clean.

LEV 13:18  The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and
 is healed,

LEV 13:19  And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright
 spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;

LEV 13:20  And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than
 the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce
 him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.

LEV 13:21  But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs
 therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the
 priest shall shut him up seven days:

LEV 13:22  And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
 pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

LEV 13:23  But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a
 burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

LEV 13:24  Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
 burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat
 reddish, or white;

LEV 13:25  Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the
 bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a
 leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him
 unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

LEV 13:26  But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair
 in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat
 dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

LEV 13:27  And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be
 spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean:
 it is the plague of leprosy.

LEV 13:28  And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the
 skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest
 shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning.

LEV 13:29  If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

LEV 13:30  Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight
 deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest
 shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head
 or beard.

LEV 13:31  And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it
 be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it;
 then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven
 days:

LEV 13:32  And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and,
 behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the
 scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;

LEV 13:33  He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest
 shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:

LEV 13:34  And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,
 behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than
 the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his
 clothes, and be clean.

LEV 13:35  But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

LEV 13:36  Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be
 spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.

LEV 13:37  But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black
 hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall
 pronounce him clean.

LEV 13:38  If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright
 spots, even white bright spots;

LEV 13:39  Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the
 skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth
 in the skin; he is clean.

LEV 13:40  And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he
 clean.

LEV 13:41  And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
 toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

LEV 13:42  And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish
 sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.

LEV 13:43  Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising
 of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as
 the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

LEV 13:44  He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him
 utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

LEV 13:45  And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and
 his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry,
 Unclean, unclean.

LEV 13:46  All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled;
 he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation
 be.

LEV 13:47  The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a
 woollen garment, or a linen garment;

LEV 13:48  Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether
 in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

LEV 13:49  And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the
 skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a
 plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:

LEV 13:50  And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath
 the plague seven days:

LEV 13:51  And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be
 spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or
 in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is
 unclean.

LEV 13:52  He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
 woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a
 fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.

LEV 13:53  And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread
 in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;

LEV 13:54  Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the
 plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:

LEV 13:55  And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed:
 and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not
 spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward,
 whether it be bare within or without.

LEV 13:56  And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark
 after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out
 of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:

LEV 13:57  And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
 woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that
 wherein the plague is with fire.

LEV 13:58  And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin
 it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it
 shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

LEV 13:59  This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or
 linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it
 clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

LEV 14:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 14:2  This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He
 shall be brought unto the priest:

LEV 14:3  And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall
 look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;

LEV 14:4  Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed
 two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

LEV 14:5  And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an
 earthen vessel over running water:

LEV 14:6  As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the
 scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood
 of the bird that was killed over the running water:

LEV 14:7  And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the
 leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living
 bird loose into the open field.

LEV 14:8  And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off
 all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that
 he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven
 days.

LEV 14:9  But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair
 off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave
 off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in
 water, and he shall be clean.

LEV 14:10  And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without
 blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth
 deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of
 oil.

LEV 14:11  And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is
 to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation:

LEV 14:12  And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass
 offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the
 LORD:

LEV 14:13  And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin
 offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering
 is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:

LEV 14:14  And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
 offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him
 that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
 great toe of his right foot:

LEV 14:15  And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into
 the palm of his own left hand:

LEV 14:16  And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his
 left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before
 the LORD:

LEV 14:17  And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put
 upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the
 thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the
 blood of the trespass offering:

LEV 14:18  And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall
 pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make
 an atonement for him before the LORD.

LEV 14:19  And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement
 for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall
 kill the burnt offering:

LEV 14:20  And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering
 upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall
 be clean.

LEV 14:21  And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one
 lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and
 one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log
 of oil;

LEV 14:22  And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to
 get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.

LEV 14:23  And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the
 priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD.

LEV 14:24  And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the
 log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the
 LORD:

LEV 14:25  And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest
 shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the
 tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his
 right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

LEV 14:26  And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left
 hand:

LEV 14:27  And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil
 that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:

LEV 14:28  And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip
 of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his
 right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the
 blood of the trespass offering:

LEV 14:29  And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put
 upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him
 before the LORD.

LEV 14:30  And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
 pigeons, such as he can get;

LEV 14:31  Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the
 other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make
 an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.

LEV 14:32  This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand
 is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.

LEV 14:33  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

LEV 14:34  When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a
 possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your
 possession;

LEV 14:35  And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying,
 It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:

LEV 14:36  Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the
 priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not
 made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:

LEV 14:37  And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be
 in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in
 sight are lower than the wall;

LEV 14:38  Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
 house, and shut up the house seven days:

LEV 14:39  And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look:
 and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;

LEV 14:40  Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in
 which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without
 the city:

LEV 14:41  And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and
 they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an
 unclean place:

LEV 14:42  And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those
 stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.

LEV 14:43  And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that
 he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after
 it is plaistered;

LEV 14:44  Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be
 spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.

LEV 14:45  And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber
 thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out
 of the city into an unclean place.

LEV 14:46  Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut
 up shall be unclean until the even.

LEV 14:47  And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that
 eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

LEV 14:48  And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the
 plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the
 priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.

LEV 14:49  And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar
 wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

LEV 14:50  And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over
 running water:

LEV 14:51  And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the
 scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain
 bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:

LEV 14:52  And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with
 the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and
 with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

LEV 14:53  But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open
 fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.

LEV 14:54  This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,

LEV 14:55  And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

LEV 14:56  And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

LEV 14:57  To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law
 of leprosy.

LEV 15:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

LEV 15:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man
 hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.

LEV 15:3  And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run
 with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his
 uncleanness.

LEV 15:4  Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and
 every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

LEV 15:5  And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
 himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:6  And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue
 shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
 even.

LEV 15:7  And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash
 his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:8  And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he
 shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
 even.

LEV 15:9  And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be
 unclean.

LEV 15:10  And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean
 until the even: and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his
 clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:11  And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed
 his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in
 water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:12  And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue,
 shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.

LEV 15:13  And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he
 shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his
 clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

LEV 15:14  And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two
 young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle
 of the congregation, and give them unto the priest:

LEV 15:15  And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the
 other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him
 before the LORD for his issue.

LEV 15:16  And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall
 wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:17  And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
 copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:18  The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they
 shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:19  And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood,
 she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be
 unclean until the even.

LEV 15:20  And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
 unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.

LEV 15:21  And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
 himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:22  And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his
 clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:23  And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when
 he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:24  And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he
 shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be
 unclean.

LEV 15:25  And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time
 of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the
 days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation:
 she shall be unclean.

LEV 15:26  Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto
 her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be
 unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.

LEV 15:27  And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash
 his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

LEV 15:28  But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
 herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

LEV 15:29  And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two
 young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle
 of the congregation.

LEV 15:30  And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other
 for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before
 the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.

LEV 15:31  Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
 uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my
 tabernacle that is among them.

LEV 15:32  This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed
 goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

LEV 15:33  And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an
 issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is
 unclean.

LEV 16:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of
 Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;

LEV 16:2  And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he
 come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy
 seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud
 upon the mercy seat.

LEV 16:3  Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a
 sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

LEV 16:4  He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen
 breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with
 the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall
 he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.

LEV 16:5  And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two
 kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.

LEV 16:6  And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for
 himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.

LEV 16:7  And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at
 the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

LEV 16:8  And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
 LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

LEV 16:9  And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, and
 offer him for a sin offering.

LEV 16:10  But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be
 presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let
 him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

LEV 16:11  And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for
 himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and
 shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:

LEV 16:12  And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off
 the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten
 small, and bring it within the vail:

LEV 16:13  And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the
 cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony,
 that he die not:

LEV 16:14  And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with
 his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he
 sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.

LEV 16:15  Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the
 people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did
 with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and
 before the mercy seat:

LEV 16:16  And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the
 uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in
 all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation,
 that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

LEV 16:17  And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when
 he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and
 have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the
 congregation of Israel.

LEV 16:18  And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make
 an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the
 blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.

LEV 16:19  And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven
 times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of
 Israel.

LEV 16:20  And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the
 tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:

LEV 16:21  And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
 goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and
 all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the
 goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:

LEV 16:22  And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land
 not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.

LEV 16:23  And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and
 shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy
 place, and shall leave them there:

LEV 16:24  And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on
 his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt
 offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the
 people.

LEV 16:25  And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

LEV 16:26  And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
 clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.

LEV 16:27  And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
 offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place,
 shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their
 skins, and their flesh, and their dung.

LEV 16:28  And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh
 in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

LEV 16:29  And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh
 month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no
 work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that
 sojourneth among you:

LEV 16:30  For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
 cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.

LEV 16:31  It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your
 souls, by a statute for ever.

LEV 16:32  And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate
 to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the
 atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:

LEV 16:33  And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall
 make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the
 altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people
 of the congregation.

LEV 16:34  And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
 atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he
 did as the LORD commanded Moses.

LEV 17:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 17:2  Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of
 Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded,
 saying,

LEV 17:3  What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox,
 or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,

LEV 17:4  And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the
 LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man
 shall be cut off from among his people:

LEV 17:5  To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices,
 which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the
 LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the
 priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD.

LEV 17:6  And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at
 the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet
 savour unto the LORD.

LEV 17:7  And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom
 they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them
 throughout their generations.

LEV 17:8  And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of
 Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt
 offering or sacrifice,

LEV 17:9  And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from
 among his people.

LEV 17:10  And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
 strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will
 even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off
 from among his people.

LEV 17:11  For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to
 you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood
 that maketh an atonement for the soul.

LEV 17:12  Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall
 eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.

LEV 17:13  And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the
 strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or
 fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover
 it with dust.

LEV 17:14  For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life
 thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood
 of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof:
 whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.

LEV 17:15  And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which
 was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger,
 he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean
 until the even: then shall he be clean.

LEV 17:16  But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his
 iniquity.

LEV 18:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 18:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD
 your God.

LEV 18:3  After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not
 do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye
 not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.

LEV 18:4  Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein:
 I am the LORD your God.

LEV 18:5  Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man
 do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.

LEV 18:6  None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to
 uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

LEV 18:7  The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt
 thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

LEV 18:8  The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy
 father's nakedness.

LEV 18:9  The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter
 of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their
 nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

LEV 18:10  The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter,
 even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own
 nakedness.

LEV 18:11  The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy
 father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

LEV 18:12  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is
 thy father's near kinswoman.

LEV 18:13  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she
 is thy mother's near kinswoman.

LEV 18:14  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou
 shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

LEV 18:15  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is
 thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

LEV 18:16  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is
 thy brother's nakedness.

LEV 18:17  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter,
 neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to
 uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.

LEV 18:18  Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover
 her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

LEV 18:19  Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness,
 as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

LEV 18:20  Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to
 defile thyself with her.

LEV 18:21  And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to
 Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

LEV 18:22  Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
 abomination.

LEV 18:23  Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith:
 neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is
 confusion.

LEV 18:24  Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these
 the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

LEV 18:25  And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof
 upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.

LEV 18:26  Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not
 commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any
 stranger that sojourneth among you:

LEV 18:27  (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which
 were before you, and the land is defiled;)

LEV 18:28  That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued
 out the nations that were before you.

LEV 18:29  For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls
 that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.

LEV 18:30  Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one
 of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye
 defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.

LEV 19:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 19:2  Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say
 unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.

LEV 19:3  Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my
 sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.

LEV 19:4  Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the
 LORD your God.

LEV 19:5  And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye
 shall offer it at your own will.

LEV 19:6  It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if
 ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.

LEV 19:7  And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it
 shall not be accepted.

LEV 19:8  Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because
 he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut
 off from among his people.

LEV 19:9  And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap
 the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy
 harvest.

LEV 19:10  And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather
 every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger:
 I am the LORD your God.

LEV 19:11  Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
 another.

LEV 19:12  And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
 profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

LEV 19:13  Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of
 him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.

LEV 19:14  Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the
 blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.

LEV 19:15  Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect
 the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in
 righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

LEV 19:16  Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people:
 neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am the LORD.

LEV 19:17  Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any
 wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

LEV 19:18  Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of
 thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.

LEV 19:19  Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with
 a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall
 a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.

LEV 19:20  And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
 betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she
 shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.

LEV 19:21  And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the
 door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass
 offering.

LEV 19:22  And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the
 trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin
 which he hath done shall be forgiven him.

LEV 19:23  And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all
 manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as
 uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall
 not be eaten of.

LEV 19:24  But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise
 the LORD withal.

LEV 19:25  And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may
 yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.

LEV 19:26  Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use
 enchantment, nor observe times.

LEV 19:27  Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar
 the corners of thy beard.

LEV 19:28  Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print
 any marks upon you: I am the LORD.

LEV 19:29  Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the
 land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.

LEV 19:30  Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the
 LORD.

LEV 19:31  Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
 wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.

LEV 19:32  Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the
 old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.

LEV 19:33  And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex
 him.

LEV 19:34  But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one
 born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers
 in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

LEV 19:35  Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight,
 or in measure.

LEV 19:36  Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye
 have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.

LEV 19:37  Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments,
 and do them: I am the LORD.

LEV 20:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 20:2  Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be
 of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that
 giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the
 people of the land shall stone him with stones.

LEV 20:3  And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from
 among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my
 sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

LEV 20:4  And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the
 man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:

LEV 20:5  Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and
 will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom
 with Molech, from among their people.

LEV 20:6  And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and
 after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against
 that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

LEV 20:7  Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your
 God.

LEV 20:8  And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which
 sanctify you.

LEV 20:9  For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely
 put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be
 upon him.

LEV 20:10  And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even
 he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the
 adulteress shall surely be put to death.

LEV 20:11  And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his
 father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood
 shall be upon them.

LEV 20:12  And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely
 be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.

LEV 20:13  If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
 of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death;
 their blood shall be upon them.

LEV 20:14  And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they
 shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among
 you.

LEV 20:15  And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and
 ye shall slay the beast.

LEV 20:16  And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou
 shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their
 blood shall be upon them.

LEV 20:17  And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his
 mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a
 wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath
 uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

LEV 20:18  And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall
 uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath
 uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from
 among their people.

LEV 20:19  And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor
 of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their
 iniquity.

LEV 20:20  And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his
 uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.

LEV 20:21  And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing:
 he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.

LEV 20:22  Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and
 do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not
 out.

LEV 20:23  And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out
 before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred
 them.

LEV 20:24  But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will
 give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am
 the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.

LEV 20:25  Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
 unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your
 souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that
 creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.

LEV 20:26  And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
 severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

LEV 20:27  A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
 wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones:
 their blood shall be upon them.

LEV 21:1  And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of
 Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his
 people:

LEV 21:2  But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and
 for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.

LEV 21:3  And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no
 husband; for her may he be defiled.

LEV 21:4  But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people,
 to profane himself.

LEV 21:5  They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they
 shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.

LEV 21:6  They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their
 God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their
 God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.

LEV 21:7  They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall
 they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.

LEV 21:8  Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy
 God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.

LEV 21:9  And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the
 whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.

LEV 21:10  And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head
 the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments,
 shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;

LEV 21:11  Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his
 father, or for his mother;

LEV 21:12  Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary
 of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am
 the LORD.

LEV 21:13  And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

LEV 21:14  A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall
 he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.

LEV 21:15  Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD
 do sanctify him.

LEV 21:16  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 21:17  Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
 generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of
 his God.

LEV 21:18  For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach:
 a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing
 superfluous,

LEV 21:19  Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

LEV 21:20  Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be
 scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

LEV 21:21  No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall
 come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish;
 he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.

LEV 21:22  He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the
 holy.

LEV 21:23  Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar,
 because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD
 do sanctify them.

LEV 21:24  And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the
 children of Israel.

LEV 22:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 22:2  Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from
 the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy
 name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.

LEV 22:3  Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
 generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel
 hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut
 off from my presence: I am the LORD.

LEV 22:4  What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running
 issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso
 toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth
 from him;

LEV 22:5  Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made
 unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he
 hath;

LEV 22:6  The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and
 shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.

LEV 22:7  And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat
 of the holy things; because it is his food.

LEV 22:8  That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat
 to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.

LEV 22:9  They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for
 it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.

LEV 22:10  There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the
 priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.

LEV 22:11  But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
 it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.

LEV 22:12  If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may
 not eat of an offering of the holy things.

LEV 22:13  But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no
 child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall
 eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eat thereof.

LEV 22:14  And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put
 the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the
 holy thing.

LEV 22:15  And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
 Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

LEV 22:16  Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their
 holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

LEV 22:17  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 22:18  Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of
 Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the
 strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for
 all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt
 offering;

LEV 22:19  Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the
 beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

LEV 22:20  But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall
 not be acceptable for you.

LEV 22:21  And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD
 to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be
 perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.

LEV 22:22  Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed,
 ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them
 upon the altar unto the LORD.

LEV 22:23  Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
 lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for
 a vow it shall not be accepted.

LEV 22:24  Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed,
 or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.

LEV 22:25  Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God
 of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be
 in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

LEV 22:26  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 22:27  When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it
 shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it
 shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

LEV 22:28  And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young
 both in one day.

LEV 22:29  And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD,
 offer it at your own will.

LEV 22:30  On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it
 until the morrow: I am the LORD.

LEV 22:31  Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.

LEV 22:32  Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among
 the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,

LEV 22:33  That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the
 LORD.

LEV 23:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 23:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the
 feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even
 these are my feasts.

LEV 23:3  Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of
 rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath
 of the LORD in all your dwellings.

LEV 23:4  These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye
 shall proclaim in their seasons.

LEV 23:5  In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's
 passover.

LEV 23:6  And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened
 bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.

LEV 23:7  In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no
 servile work therein.

LEV 23:8  But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days:
 in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work
 therein.

LEV 23:9  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 23:10  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be
 come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest
 thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto
 the priest:

LEV 23:11  And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you:
 on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.

LEV 23:12  And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
 without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.

LEV 23:13  And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour
 mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour:
 and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.

LEV 23:14  And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears,
 until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it
 shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your
 dwellings.

LEV 23:15  And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from
 the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall
 be complete:

LEV 23:16  Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty
 days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.

LEV 23:17  Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth
 deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are
 the firstfruits unto the LORD.

LEV 23:18  And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the
 first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt
 offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings,
 even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.

LEV 23:19  Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and
 two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.

LEV 23:20  And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for
 a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy
 to the LORD for the priest.

LEV 23:21  And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy
 convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a
 statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.

LEV 23:22  And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean
 riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou
 gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and
 to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.

LEV 23:23  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 23:24  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month,
 in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing
 of trumpets, an holy convocation.

LEV 23:25  Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering
 made by fire unto the LORD.

LEV 23:26  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 23:27  Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of
 atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict
 your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

LEV 23:28  And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
 atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.

LEV 23:29  For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same
 day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

LEV 23:30  And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the
 same soul will I destroy from among his people.

LEV 23:31  Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
 throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

LEV 23:32  It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your
 souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye
 celebrate your sabbath.

LEV 23:33  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 23:34  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this
 seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.

LEV 23:35  On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
 servile work therein.

LEV 23:36  Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on
 the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an
 offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do
 no servile work therein.

LEV 23:37  These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy
 convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt
 offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing
 upon his day:

LEV 23:38  Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside
 all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the
 LORD.

LEV 23:39  Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
 gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven
 days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a
 sabbath.

LEV 23:40  And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees,
 branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the
 brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.

LEV 23:41  And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year.
 It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it
 in the seventh month.

LEV 23:42  Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born
 shall dwell in booths:

LEV 23:43  That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to
 dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD
 your God.

LEV 23:44  And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the
 LORD.

LEV 24:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 24:2  Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil
 olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.

LEV 24:3  Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
 congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before
 the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.

LEV 24:4  He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD
 continually.

LEV 24:5  And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two
 tenth deals shall be in one cake.

LEV 24:6  And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure
 table before the LORD.

LEV 24:7  And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on
 the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

LEV 24:8  Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually,
 being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.

LEV 24:9  And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the
 holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by
 fire by a perpetual statute.

LEV 24:10  And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian,
 went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman
 and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;

LEV 24:11  And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and
 cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was
 Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)

LEV 24:12  And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed
 them.

LEV 24:13  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 24:14  Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that
 heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone
 him.

LEV 24:15  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever
 curseth his God shall bear his sin.

LEV 24:16  And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put
 to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the
 stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the
 Lord, shall be put to death.

LEV 24:17  And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

LEV 24:18  And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.

LEV 24:19  And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so
 shall it be done to him;

LEV 24:20  Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a
 blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.

LEV 24:21  And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
 killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

LEV 24:22  Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for
 one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.

LEV 24:23  And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring
 forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the
 children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.

LEV 25:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

LEV 25:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come
 into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the
 LORD.

LEV 25:3  Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune
 thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

LEV 25:4  But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a
 sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy
 vineyard.

LEV 25:5  That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not
 reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of
 rest unto the land.

LEV 25:6  And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for
 thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy
 stranger that sojourneth with thee.

LEV 25:7  And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all
 the increase thereof be meat.

LEV 25:8  And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times
 seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee
 forty and nine years.

LEV 25:9  Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth
 day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet
 sound throughout all your land.

LEV 25:10  And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
 throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a
 jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye
 shall return every man unto his family.

LEV 25:11  A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,
 neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it
 of thy vine undressed.

LEV 25:12  For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the
 increase thereof out of the field.

LEV 25:13  In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
 possession.

LEV 25:14  And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy
 neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:

LEV 25:15  According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of
 thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall
 sell unto thee:

LEV 25:16  According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price
 thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price
 of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell
 unto thee.

LEV 25:17  Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy
 God:for I am the LORD your God.

LEV 25:18  Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do
 them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

LEV 25:19  And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and
 dwell therein in safety.

LEV 25:20  And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we
 shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

LEV 25:21  Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it
 shall bring forth fruit for three years.

LEV 25:22  And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the
 ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.

LEV 25:23  The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye
 are strangers and sojourners with me.

LEV 25:24  And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption
 for the land.

LEV 25:25  If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
 possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem
 that which his brother sold.

LEV 25:26  And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem
 it;

LEV 25:27  Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the
 overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his
 possession.

LEV 25:28  But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold
 shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile:
 and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.

LEV 25:29  And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may
 redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he
 redeem it.

LEV 25:30  And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the
 house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that
 bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.

LEV 25:31  But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them
 shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they
 shall go out in the jubile.

LEV 25:32  Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the
 cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.

LEV 25:33  And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
 sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for
 the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the
 children of Israel.

LEV 25:34  But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it
 is their perpetual possession.

LEV 25:35  And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;
 then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner;
 that he may live with thee.

LEV 25:36  Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy
 brother may live with thee.

LEV 25:37  Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
 victuals for increase.

LEV 25:38  I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of
 Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

LEV 25:39  And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold
 unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:

LEV 25:40  But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
 thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

LEV 25:41  And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with
 him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his
 fathers shall he return.

LEV 25:42  For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of
 Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

LEV 25:43  Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.

LEV 25:44  Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be
 of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and
 bondmaids.

LEV 25:45  Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you,
 of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they
 begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.

LEV 25:46  And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after
 you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever:
 but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over
 another with rigour.

LEV 25:47  And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother
 that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or
 sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:

LEV 25:48  After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren
 may redeem him:

LEV 25:49  Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is
 nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may
 redeem himself.

LEV 25:50  And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he
 was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be
 according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant
 shall it be with him.

LEV 25:51  If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give
 again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.

LEV 25:52  And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he
 shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again
 the price of his redemption.

LEV 25:53  And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other
 shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

LEV 25:54  And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
 in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

LEV 25:55  For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
 servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your
 God.

LEV 26:1  Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a
 standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to
 bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.

LEV 26:2  Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.

LEV 26:3  If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;

LEV 26:4  Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her
 increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.

LEV 26:5  And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage
 shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the
 full, and dwell in your land safely.

LEV 26:6  And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none
 shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither
 shall the sword go through your land.

LEV 26:7  And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by
 the sword.

LEV 26:8  And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall
 put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the
 sword.

LEV 26:9  For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply
 you, and establish my covenant with you.

LEV 26:10  And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the
 new.

LEV 26:11  And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.

LEV 26:12  And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my
 people.

LEV 26:13  I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of
 Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of
 your yoke, and made you go upright.

LEV 26:14  But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
 commandments;

LEV 26:15  And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my
 judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my
 covenant:

LEV 26:16  I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror,
 consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause
 sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall
 eat it.

LEV 26:17  And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before
 your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when
 none pursueth you.

LEV 26:18  And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will
 punish you seven times more for your sins.

LEV 26:19  And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
 heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

LEV 26:20  And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not
 yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.

LEV 26:21  And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I
 will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.

LEV 26:22  I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your
 children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high
 ways shall be desolate.

LEV 26:23  And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk
 contrary unto me;

LEV 26:24  Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet
 seven times for your sins.

LEV 26:25  And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of
 my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will
 send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the
 enemy.

LEV 26:26  And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake
 your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by
 weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.

LEV 26:27  And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary
 unto me;

LEV 26:28  Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will
 chastise you seven times for your sins.

LEV 26:29  And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
 daughters shall ye eat.

LEV 26:30  And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and
 cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor
 you.

LEV 26:31  And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto
 desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.

LEV 26:32  And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which
 dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

LEV 26:33  And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword
 after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.

LEV 26:34  Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
 desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and
 enjoy her sabbaths.

LEV 26:35  As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest
 in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

LEV 26:36  And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness
 into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken
 leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they
 shall fall when none pursueth.

LEV 26:37  And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,
 when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.

LEV 26:38  And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies
 shall eat you up.

LEV 26:39  And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in
 your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they
 pine away with them.

LEV 26:40  If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
 fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also
 they have walked contrary unto me;

LEV 26:41  And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought
 them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be
 humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:

LEV 26:42  Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant
 with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will
 remember the land.

LEV 26:43  The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths,
 while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the
 punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my
 judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.

LEV 26:44  And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I
 will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them
 utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.

LEV 26:45  But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors,
 whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen,
 that I might be their God: I am the LORD.

LEV 26:46  These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made
 between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

LEV 27:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 27:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man
 shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy
 estimation.

LEV 27:3  And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even
 unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver,
 after the shekel of the sanctuary.

LEV 27:4  And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.

LEV 27:5  And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy
 estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten
 shekels.

LEV 27:6  And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy
 estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female
 thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.

LEV 27:7  And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then
 thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

LEV 27:8  But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
 himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his
 ability that vowed shall the priest value him.

LEV 27:9  And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD,
 all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.

LEV 27:10  He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for
 a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the
 exchange thereof shall be holy.

LEV 27:11  And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
 sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:

LEV 27:12  And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou
 valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

LEV 27:13  But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part
 thereof unto thy estimation.

LEV 27:14  And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
 LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the
 priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

LEV 27:15  And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall
 add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be
 his.

LEV 27:16  And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of
 his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof:
 an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.

LEV 27:17  If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy
 estimation it shall stand.

LEV 27:18  But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall
 reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the
 year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.

LEV 27:19  And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then
 he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it
 shall be assured to him.

LEV 27:20  And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to
 another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

LEV 27:21  But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto
 the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.

LEV 27:22  And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought,
 which is not of the fields of his possession;

LEV 27:23  Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation,
 even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that
 day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.

LEV 27:24  In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it
 was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.

LEV 27:25  And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the
 sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

LEV 27:26  Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's
 firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the
 LORD's.

LEV 27:27  And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according
 to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be
 not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.

LEV 27:28  Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the
 LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his
 possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto
 the LORD.

LEV 27:29  None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but
 shall surely be put to death.

LEV 27:30  And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or
 of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.

LEV 27:31  And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add
 thereto the fifth part thereof.

LEV 27:32  And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
 whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.

LEV 27:33  He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he
 change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof
 shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

LEV 27:34  These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the
 children of Israel in mount Sinai.

## QUESTION.TXT

{% raw %}
```
Q: Where's the display program to let me read the Bible?
 
A: The files on the Bible diskettes are ASCII text files, and were so large
that we were unable to find a text display program that would be able to
display an entire book without errors. Therefore, we have not included a
program to display the files.
 
Q: So, how do I read the files?
 
A: There are a number of ways you could read the Bible text files. If you
have a word processor, you could load the files into it, and read them
through it. Or, by using the DOS TYPE command, you could read the files on
your computer's screen. For example, to read the topics list, your would
use the command:
                         TYPE TOPICS.OUT <enter>
 
Q: What if I want to print the Bible out to my printer?
 
A: Again, if you have a word processor, you could load the book of the
Bible you wish to print into it, then print it from there. Or you could use
one of the following DOS commands to print the file. For example, and using
the Topics list again:
 
                         PRINT TOPICS.OUT <enter>
                                    or
                       COPY TOPICS.OUT PRN: <enter>
 
 
Q: Who wrote these Bible Disks?
 
A: As far as we know, the text files which make up this Bible-on-disk are
public domain and not owned by anyone. As to who actually typed in every
word, we don't know.
