## Information about "LIST"

    LIST is a printer-related utility program designed to aid programmers
    and others with simple document printing requirements.  The program
    controls printing of documents, providing automatic pagination, page
    numbering, titling, printing of headers and footers, and a number of
    other similar features.  Most significantly, the program easily
    handles printing multiple documents, such as might occur when a
    programmer wishes to print out all program source code files used on a
    project.
    
    System Requirements: 256K, one floppy drive and a monochrome,
    black & white, or color monitor.  To print hardcopy documents, a
    parallel (LPT) printer is required.
    
    How to Start: After consulting the documentation in LIST.DOC,
    initiate the program by running INSTALL and then LIST.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $10.00
