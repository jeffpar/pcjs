## Information about "BUDGETRK AND TASKPLAN"

    Here are five useful programs in BASIC for planning or tracking business
    projects, expenses and making loan analyses.  BUDGETRAK (Budget Track)
    tracks budgeted disbursements by numbering budgeted items as grouped
    under any one of eighty projects.  It tracks them on three levels:
    DISBURSEMENTS being the lowest level, ITEMS comprise the middle level
    and PROJECTS are the highest level.
    
    The three-part LOAN section contains a Loan Savings Solution which
    prepares schedules of loan payments, with and without extra payments to
    the principal.  Leas-By1 compares automobile purchase (with loan) to
    closed-in lease.  It's an analysis applications package for "private
    use" autos.  Loan Mortgage Solutions prepares schedules of loan
    payments, both with and without payment to the principal. Rounding out
    this package is TASKPLAN, an elementary project manager.
    
    System Requirements: BASIC
    
    How to Start: Consult the DOC files for BudgetTrack and TaskPlan; the
    other three have interior directions.  To run the BASIC programs,
    consult the directions in GETTING STARTED for your configuration.
