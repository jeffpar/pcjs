## Information about "FASTBUCKS 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1296)"

    FASTBUCKS is a completely menu-driven home-finance program that is easy
    to understand and operate.
    
    FASTBUCKS supports up to 25 accounts each in checking, savings, charge
    accounts, and 25 cash sheets. With each account you can update, list,
    reconcile, balance, or edit a record. List an account by month, year,
    or expense category. The program offers a graphic illustration of your
    expenses for a certain year, and shows your overall average
    expenditures.
    
    Account listings can be displayed or printed. When listing a checking
    account and overall balance, the program will immediately show you if a
    check has bounced by displaying its line in inverse print. Each line
    gives the date, description, whether or not it is a credit or debit, and
    total balance to date.
    
    Use the recursive budget model to create a workable family budget.
    Calculate total income, for both the pay period and the year, and
    compute your "disposable" income. Allot transactions to your various
    expense categories or to your savings account.
    
    There is a financial calculation section to calculate item
    depreciation, investments and loan information, plus a complete loan
    amortization generator.
    
    Change initialization parameters for display type, printer, drive, data
    file path, and expense categories as desired. FASTBUCKS presently
    supports 141 printers and a user configuration, if your printer is not
    presently supported.
