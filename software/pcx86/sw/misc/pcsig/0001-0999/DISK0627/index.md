## Information about "PC-WRITE 2 OF 3 (ALSO 78, 1235)"

    PC-WRITE is a wordprocessor with features and power that
    overshadow many commercial wordprocessing programs on the market.
    Advanced users and wordprocessing professionals will find the package
    very multi-faceted; it can accomplish virtually any task on almost any
    printer.  While essentially an advanced program, thanks to a special
    tutorial and new help screens, beginners can be running the program in
    minutes.
    
    PC-WRITE handles files that are as large as the available RAM memory in
    your computer.  The program allows quick and easy access to the
    features that most wordprocessors include: cut-and-paste of blocks of
    text; headers and footers; automatic page numbering; editing multiple
    documents; bold type and other special text enhancements; a spell
    checker that lets you add words; and many others.  Other features
    include:  multiple-column layout; cut-and-paste of rectangular boxes of
    text; menus to help you select page layout and fonts; support of
    foreign language characters; and a feature that lets you use your
    computer like a typewriter.
    
    PC-WRITE supports most printers (over 800) and includes special
    supports for laser printers, including Postscript.  It also accepts most
    WordStar commands and converts WordStar files.  The  pop-up menus make
    most tasks easier and the user guide is included on-disk.
