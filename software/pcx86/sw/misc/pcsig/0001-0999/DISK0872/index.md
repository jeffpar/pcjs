## Information about "AMPLE NOTICE APPOINTMENT CALANDER"

    AMPLE NOTICE is a calendar and alarm clock program that helps organize
    your schedule of appointments.  Appointments and notes are entered into
    a standard text file in any of a variety of simple formats.  Each day,
    you view a calendar of commitments taken from this file.  This text file
    can be edited from within the program or from an ASCII wordprocessor.
    
    You can specify that a birthday occurs each July 17, or that you have a
    meeting every other Tuesday at 4:00 for five meetings, or that Father's
    Day is the third Sunday in June.
    
    Appointments that include a time can automatically set a pop-up alarm
    clock to notify you at a given advance interval.  Print a specified
    range of dates to keep track of your appointments while away from your
    computer.  These can be in a variety of print styles including a
    ``tiny'' option of very compressed listings for your wallet or purse.
    You can also print a calendar for any range of months for a particular
    year.  The sorting and archiving options let you keep track of past
    activities for business purposes.  Searching for a given appointment
    (future or past) is fast and easy.  Also included is a program for
    addressing envelopes sideways from data on the screen or from a file.
