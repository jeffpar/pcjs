## Information about "DEEP SPACE 3-D   1 OF 2 (ALSO 867)"

    DEEP SPACE 3-D is a powerful star mapping program that uses a database
    of over 19,000 stars (expandable to nearly 250,000 stars and 1100
    comets), used by a number of serious astronomy publications to create
    their star charts.
    
    It can produce all-sky views or horizon views for any day and time
    anywhere on earth. Selected portions of the sky can be chosen by
    constellation or coordinates, then zoomed in for more detailed views.
    Comet paths can be computed and added to the star maps to create finder
    charts or to visualize the orbits of comets from any point in space. A
    new "What's Up" feature tells at a glance the times of sunrise, sunset,
    twilight, moon phases, and positions of the sun, moon, planets and
    current comets for a given day and time. Once computed, the information
    is stored and may be added to the star maps.
    
    The most unique feature of DEEP SPACE 3-D is depth. It can produce
    stereo 3-D printouts that show the stars or the orbits of comets in
    their true three dimensional relationships when viewed with a stereo
    viewer. A 3-D viewer is included in the registration price.
    
    Although DEEP SPACE 3-D has many features that will be attractive to
    experts, it is simple enough to be used easily by beginners. An
    extensive help menu teaches the beginner as much about astronomy as it
    tells about the program. An improved user interface provides
    intelligent default values in case the feature is beyond the interest or
    knowledge of the user. It supports CGA, EGA, VGA and Hercules monitors.
    
    This program is an ideal starting point for anyone who is looking for a
    reliable guide to observational astronomy. For centuries man has gazed
    at the night-time sky and wondered what was out there. DEEP SPACE will
    help answer some of those questions.
