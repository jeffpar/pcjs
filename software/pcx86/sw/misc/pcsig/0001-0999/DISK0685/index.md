## Information about "NEW FIG FORTH"

    For fans of FORTH, here is the latest version of this unusual

    ~  All I/O is vectored and may be re-directed within FORTH
    ~  Command line interpretation
    
    The accompanying documentation includes a user's guide, a technical
    reference manual, and a FORTH glossary (a list and explanation of each
    FORTH word which has been changed or added to this version).
