## Information about "THE WINDOW BOSS 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1113)"

    WINDOW BOSS enhances and accelerates the development of systems and
    applications programs in the C language.  Create programs that have the
    same look and feel as the top-selling spreadsheet, database and desktop
    accessory packages.  Pop-up windows, pull-down menus, status lines, and
    in-context on-line help functions can be easily implemented.  Your
    applications can drag windows around the screen and automatically sense
    the video card installed.  All of this without snow, flicker, or
    delay!
    
    Includes support for Microsoft 6.0, Microsoft QuickC 2.5, shadowed
    windows, super titles, and graphics character text input.  The Window
    Boss now supports Microsoft, Borland, Lattice, Watcom, Mix Power C,
    Computer Innovations, Datalight, and Aztec C!
