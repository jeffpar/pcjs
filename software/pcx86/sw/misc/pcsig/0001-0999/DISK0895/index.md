## Information about "SCOUT AND SIMS"

    SCOUT is a memory-resident disk file manager you can customize to your
    liking. Define paths and your favorite applications and change your
    options at any time.
    
    Any program can be executed from SCOUT by scrolling through the
    directory and pressing the appropriate key. Tag files or scroll
    through the directory to copy, move, alter, delete, or rename the
    files. SCOUT can search for a particular file, and can change the
    file's date and time. Create a directory, create a volume label,
    format, or display disk memory information. Read text files and even
    display a directory listing of an .ARC file.
    
    Special features include a displayable calendar and an ASCII character
    table. SCOUT also displays RAM memory usage, showing how much memory
    each memory-resident program is currently using. When exiting from
    SCOUT, you have the option of removing it from memory.
    
    SELECT I MENU SYSTEM (SIMS) is a memory-resident program to design,
    edit, and maintain menus for your computer system providing
    user-friendly access to programs.
    
    Menus are created from an ASCII text source file converted into menu
    format.  These menus greatly simplify computer operation and program
    access for new and unfamiliar users of your system.  Not only does this
    program help you save time in training other users, but it also eases
    personal use.
    
    A security feature can be selected that requires a password for certain
    options on the menu.  Total freedom is given to the menu creator
    regarding screen layout and options specified.  The number of menus
    that can be incorporated into the system is only limited by available
    disk space.  The screen design controls the colors, windows, menu
    options, placement of options, procedure for execution, user-defined
    fields, and security for the menus.
    
    In other words, you can be quite creative with this program and use it
    for any application you wish.
