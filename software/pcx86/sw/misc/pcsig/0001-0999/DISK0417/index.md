## Information about "A.D.A. PROLOG"

    The PROLOG -- "Programming in Logic" -- language on this disk is
    the educational/public domain version from Automata Design
    Associates (A.D.A.).  PROLOG is considered one of the major fifth
    generation languages and is not for the faint-hearted.
    Considered the leading edge of most expert systems and artifical
    intelligence program developments, PROLOG is remarkably good for
    writing "question answering" systems.  It excells at writing
    programs that perform complicated strategies for computing the
    best or worst way to accomplish a task, or to avoid an
    undesirable result.
    
    Besides PROLOG, there are many companion programs here: PROLOGED.COM
    is a simple screen editor for use within PROLOG; ATN.ARC contains Lou
    Schumacher's natural language parser; EXPERT.ARC contains expert
    systems for such fields as medical, rockblasting, fault diagnosis,
    etc.  GAMES.ARC has some simple board games and adventure games, while
    PUZZLES.ARC demonstrates techniques of translating word problems into
    unambiguous logic.
    
    PIE.ARC contains Simon Blackwell's "PIE" Truth Maintenance System
    in revised, debugged, and enlarged form.  This system is found in
    the directory "expert" and augments the strictly deductive
    capabilities of raw Prolog with additional forms of reasoning.
    
    System Requirements: 256K, one disk drive and monochrome display.
