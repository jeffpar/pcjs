## Information about "CPA LEDGER 2 OF 2 (ALSO 466)"

    A menu-driven general ledger and financial statement program designed
    for non-manufacturing businesses that offer products or services for
    sale.
    
    Start your books and maintain them: post transactions; prepare
    unadjusted and post-closing trial balances, and income statements; print
    a list of all postings for any period; search for previously-entered
    transactions; and reconstruct specific GL accounts and add new ones.
    CPA-LEDGER has plenty of muscle to record your daily transactions. Any
    single general ledger entry can have up to 30 debits and 30 credits,
    with total values of up to $999,999,999.99. A very powerful system.
    Some knowledge of double-entry bookkeeping is necessary to operate this
    package.
