## Information about "FIVE DICE GAME"

    Get ready to roll!  FIVE DICE GAME is a fun way to play dice.  It is
    played by two or more players, with the object to attain a score of
    5000 points or more.  Each player rolls the dice, accumulating a score
    as long as he rolls scoring dice.  If he fails to roll any score, he
    loses his turn and a "scratch" is posted against him.  After any player
    has 5000 points, every other player gets one more chance to beat that
    score.  The game can be played by up to 15 human or
    computer-controlled players (counting yourself).  The computer can play
    any of three different strategies, from very conservative to fairly
    aggressive.
    
    The program is very easy to run and instructions are included.  This is
    an excellent program for any user -- novice to expert.  The Turbo Pascal
    source code is included in case you want to modify or write your own
    computer opponents.
