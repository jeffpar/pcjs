## Information about "WRITER'S HEAVEN AND MOREPERFECT"

    WRITER'S HEAVEN transforms the popular wordprocessing program PC-Write
    into one of the fastest and most efficient editing tools today.
    
    WRITER'S HEAVEN, using PC-WRITE's own macro feature, grafts a unique
    keyboard structure onto PC-WRITE itself.  The result is a
    wordprocessor that combines speed, power, simplicity, and ease of
    learning -- a wordprocessor that brings on-screen editing significantly
    closer to the speed of thought.  While most of the principal PC-WRITE
    command keys remain intact as an alternate command set, you can now edit
    text without ever moving your hands from the typewriter position, and
    you can do it faster than ever before.
    
    Here is a utility program WordPerfect fans should have.  MOREPERFECT
    adds to the word processing program a new set of command keys in an
    ingenious arrangement.  With a single keystroke, you can move the cursor
    or delete--by character, word, line, sentence, paragraph, or page--
    forward or backward--without moving your hands from the letter keys!
    MOREPERFECT can double your editing speed, yet it's easy to learn and
    use.

                                    HOTKEY v1.04
                       Keyboard Speedup Program for the IBM PC


          On a normal PC, HOTKEY will roughly double the keyboard
          auto-repeat rate.  This makes moving the cursor around a LOT
          faster and easier! 

          Most keyboard speed-up programs share an annoying trait with the
          hardware repeat built into your keyboard:  they keep stuffing
          keystrokes into the type-ahead buffer even when the program
          reading the keyboard is falling behind.  This causes an
          unpredictable "overshoot" when you release the key! 

          HOTKEY solves this problem by only repeating a key if your
          keyboard type-ahead buffer is empty.  This keeps the auto-repeat
          in sync with each program, giving you fast auto-repeat for fast
          programs and slow auto-repeat for slow programs.  HOTKEY even
          performs the same service on your hardware auto-repeat,
          virtually eliminating overshoot while retaining the advantages
          of faster operation!  (Note:  you can still type ahead -- just
          press the same key repeatedly.)

          Unlike some keyboard speed-up programs, HOTKEY does NOT have
          trouble when you use Alt plus the numeric keypad to type
          graphic characters - it won't run away on you!

          HOTKEY should normally be installed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
          BEFORE any other keyboard-sensitive programs.

          CAUTION: Because HOTKEY does tricky things with the hardware
          and BIOS, it may not work on all machines - test it carefully!
