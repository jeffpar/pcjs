## Information about "BUDGETRAK 1 OF 2 (ALSO 520)"

    BUDGETRAK is an accounting package for anyone who needs to track their
    budget and expenses more closely than is possible with an ordinary
    accounting system.  Encumbrance accounting (the method used here) tracks
    obligations and planned expenses rather than actual expenses.
    
    The system will handle up to budget records.  For simplicity, each
    month's transactions are stored on an individual file that can contain
    1200 transactions.  During the month you can look up account balances at
    any time instantly. You may print a report of the transactions entered
    to that point for the month or for any previous month.  The report is
    sorted and summarized by company, department and grand total.
    
    When the actual expense is known, it is entered and the encumbrance
    amount and budget are updated.  This gives a more accurate picture, for
    budgeting purposes, than waiting to record an actual expense.
    BUDGETRAK handles single and double-entry bookkeeping and has a built-in
    password system.
