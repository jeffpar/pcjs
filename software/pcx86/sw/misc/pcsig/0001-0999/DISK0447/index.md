## Information about "THE SKY"

    Two astral programs: AIRNAV helps prepare a flight log for flight over
    a predetermined route of up to twenty points (for most light aircraft
    this provides waypoints close enough together, and enough waypoints for
    one leg without refueling).  The log gives the geographic coordinates
    of the point, the distance between points, the true course and the
    estimated time between points. It prints space on the log for entering
    actual time between points.  All flight planning is done on the basis
    of one estimated speed for the entire series of legs. The second
    program, STARFINDER, allows you to locate the various stars and
    constellations.
    
    System Requirements:  64k, two disk drives, color-graphics.
    
    How to Start:  Load DOS and type STARFIND to enter the STARFIND
    program.  To run the BASIC programs consult the directions for GETTING
    STARTED for your configuration.  Consult AIRNAV.DOC for program
    information on AIRNAV.BAS.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $35.00 for STARFINDER
