## Information about "ACE 1 OF 2 (ALSO #693)"

    This program is a general-purpose astronomy software package with three
    separate parts -- ACECALC, ACESOLAR and ACECAT.
    
    ACECALC is a menu-driven astronomical ephemeris. Perform the most
    needed astronomical calculations involving the sun, moon and planets.
    The menu displays the local time, date and time zone name, universal
    time, local mean sidereal time, julian day, and the name of the location
    designated in the installation. It also calculates astrophotography
    exposures, precession of coordinates, phases of the moon, equinoxes and
    solstices, and satellites of Jupiter.
    
    ACESOLAR provides information on objects in the solar system such as
    numeric data on the sun, the planets and their satellites. Also
    available are narrative descriptions of the sun and planets and
    observational data.
    
    ACECAT lets you search the sky catalog for objects by name, catalog
    number, and position -- in terms of R.A./declination, object type, and
    constellation. This sky catalog provides data on over 2000 deep-sky
    objects, the entire Messier Catalog, 100 named objects, all bright stars
    to magnitude 2.00, and 100 prominent double stars, with detailed
    commentary on nearly 400 of these objects. Objects can be searched on
    the basis of one criterion or by a combination.
