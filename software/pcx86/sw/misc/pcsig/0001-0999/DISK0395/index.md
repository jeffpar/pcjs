## Information about "HOME INVENTORY"

    Keep track of everything you own; furniture, heirlooms, paintings,
    silver, collections, etc.  Know where everything is, where it came from
    and what it is worth.  Perfect for insurance coverage and claims.
    
    Use your own words or specialized expressions to describe all the data
    you record.  You can store and retrieve by various categories such as
    room or chairs or "Mother's." Record serial numbers or other
    identification.
    
    The documentation for this menu-driven program is extensive and very
    thorough.  Routines are included to print complete inventories or
    reports on specific categories.  A must for every homeowner!
