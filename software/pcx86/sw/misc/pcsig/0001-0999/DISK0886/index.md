## Information about "DIVORCE, ANIMATED STRATEGY FOR MEN"

    CALIFORNIA DIVORCE is designed to educate men on their rights and the
    procedures they should know about and follow -- in California -- in case
    of a divorce.
    
    This program presents a series of graphic screens along with text
    concerning the legal matters of divorce, and is written in a humorous
    manner, entertaining and educational.  Since it was written by a man for
    other men, it does have a slight bias against women and marriage in
    general.  Once viewed, the educated user can then choose a course of
    action on a self-help basis or with the assistance of legal counsel.
