## Information about "LINPACK LIBRARY"

    The Linear Equation Package (LINPACK) is a set of routines which solves
    systems of linear equations and related problems.  This package was
    developed by the Applied Mathematics Division of Argonne National
    Laboratory; this source code was taken from a distribution disk
    provided by International Mathematics and Statistical Libraries, Inc.
    (IMSL).
    
    System Requirements:  FORTRAN compiler, 256K memory, color
    monitor, one drive, graphics card and printer.
    
    How to Start:   For instructions on FOR listings, refer to your FORTRAN
    language manual. Consult the INDEX file to review the routines included
    on this disk.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $10.00
