## Information about "REFLIST"

    REFLIST is an easy-to-use program that lets you create and format lists
    of references and bibliographies, --  elements which are always a
    problem for the writer submitting material to a variety of publishing
    houses, each with its own specific requirements.
    
    The truly unique feature of REFLIST is that once your paper has been
    written, it reformats your references into different user-defined
    formats.  You can submit a paper to one publisher with the references
    in one format and then, with REFLIST, reformat the references to a
    different format expected by another publisher -- all quickly and
    easily. In addition, REFLIST has instructions for quick integration
    into WordPerfect, PC-Write, or any ASCII-based wordprocessor.
