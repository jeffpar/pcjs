## Information about "WORLD STATISTICS"

    WORLD is a simple, menu-driven database of statistical and demographic
    information about the nations.  The information was extracted from
    "The Encyclopedia Britanica Year Book for 1986" and "Countries of the
    World and Their Leaders Yearbook 1986."
    
    Through the main menu you can select information about the names,
    capitals, geography, population, per capita income, sovereignity of
    more than 100 countries.  Probably the most interesting menu is the
    Vital Statistics which also gives the death and birth rates, infant
    mortality and life expectancy rates for male and female citizens.
    
    System Requirements: 64K, one disk drive and monochrome display
