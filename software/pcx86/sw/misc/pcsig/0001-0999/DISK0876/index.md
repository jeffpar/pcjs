## Information about "G.I.F.T.S. GREAT GIFT IDEAS"

    Having that same old trouble coming up with a gift for Aunt Gertrude
    year after year? How about Mom? Given her all the gifts you could
    think of already?
    
    G.I.F.T.S. is a database designed to give you gift ideas for people.
    From a menu you select two key words for the price range of the present,
    the category of the item, and the type of person it's for. Gifts are
    then selected out of the database, which may be viewed on the screen or
    printed on the printer. Each listing will display the title of the
    gift, the approximate cost, the supplier, a description, and a comment.
    
    Got that charge card ready?
