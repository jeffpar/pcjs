## Information about "|STAT 3 OF 4 (ALSO 990, 991, 2292)"

    STAT is a set of data-manipulation and analysis programs developed at
    the University of California, San Diego, and at the Wang Institute of
    Graduate Studies.  They were designed under the UNIX philosophy that
    says individual programs should be designed as tools to do one task well
    and produce output suitable for input to other programs.
    
    There are two sets of STAT programs: data manipulation and data
    analysis.  The data manipulation programs are general utilities that
    cooperate with other programs.  The data analysis programs compute the
    most widely-used descriptive and inferential statistics.  Although these
    are independent programs, the output from one program can be used as
    input to another.  A solid knowledge of statistics and computers is
    assumed.
