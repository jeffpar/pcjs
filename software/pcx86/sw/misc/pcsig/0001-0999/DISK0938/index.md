## Information about "CHEMICAL MOLECULAR MODELING"

    CHEMICAL -- a molecular-modeling program for 3-D representations of
    chemical elements.
    
    Select atoms from the Periodic Table and the program retrieves the
    electron orbital information. The atoms can be bonded into molecules,
    and the molecules bonded with other molecules to make large chemical
    structures. The chemical is displayed as it is constructed, and when
    formed, can be rotated and viewed. The Hybrid and Ionize commands can
    be used to alter the orbitals before bonding. Read, write and view a
    chemical data file from the disk. CHEMICAL also has a help function
    and a tutorial.
    
    Included is CHEMVIEW (an EGA-only function), a companion program that
    shows three-dimensional animation of the models made with CHEMICAL.
