## Information about "LETUS A-B-C #13"

    Letus A-B-C is a database in PC-FILE III format containing references
    to articles in six major PC oriented magazines, beginning with 1982.
    This release of Letus A-B-C covers the following two magazines devoted
    to the IBM PC: Byte Magazine (BYTE), and PC Week (PCWK).  This database
    provides the PC user with a tool for easily performing literature
    searches at a very nominal cost in one's office or home. The search is
    done by keyword fields as well as identification fields (i.e., author,
    title, magazine issue, and page); also, the authors have included
    three lines that give a general description of the article.
    
    System Requirements:   128k, 2 disk drives, PC-FILE III (Disk No 5)
    
    How to Start: It is very important to read the Documentation file
    (Letus.doc) located on disk #350 either by screening it (entering TYPE
    LETUS.DOC at the A> and using CTRL-S to pause it) or accessing it with
    your word processor.  To run it, "boot-up" the DOS system and put
    PC-FILE system disk in drive A; enter PC-FILE <CR>.  PC-FILE will
    ask where the database is; you will have put Letus A-B-C Disk #13
    in drive "B", so you will enter B:LETUS <CR>.  The various files
    on this diskette, corresponding to magazine and year, will
    be displayed on the screen for your selection.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $10.00 per disk.
