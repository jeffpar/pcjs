## Information about "BILLING MANAGER 1 OF 2 (ALSO 910)"

    dTIME-KEEPER is designed to increase effectiveness in the client
    billing process, by providing current accounts receivable totals, past
    due account aging, and present maximum clarity in the clients
    statement.  The system makes provision for adding state sales tax to
    taxable items billed to the client.
    
    We believe the most unique features of dTIME-KEEPER are accounting for
    billing time by the minute, the ``extended description lines'' of the
    billing/payments description, multiple time keepers (employees) and
    automatic (recurrent) billing of standard monthly or quarterly charges
    to a client, such as a retainer, monthly, or quarterly bookkeeping
    services. dTIME-KEEPER is completely menu-driven (multiple choice
    operation) and prompts the operator for all required entries.
    
    Extensive error trapping is incorporated in the data input to assure
    maximum accuracy of the information available to you.  The billing code
    description is 35 characters and spaces, about average for this type of
    information, and with ``extended description lines,'' you may expand
    this description by up to 99 lines of 60 characters and spaces.
