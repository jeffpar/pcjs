## Information about "THE WRITERS TOOL KIT"

    The Writer's Toolkit is a collection of 20 executable utility programs
    inspired by Kernighan and Pike's Software Tools.  Most of the
    utilities are filters that process text files.  These utilities
    include: converting lower case to upper case and upper case to lower
    case, encrypting and decrypting files etc.  Each utility has a well
    written documentation file with examples for each utility.
    
    The most interesting program is MEMO.  This program will display memos
    that have the same date as the system date.  Runnerup is the FREQ.EXE
    which determines frequency of use but only works on a sorted list
    of words. You will have to use the WORDS and SORT programs first but
    very handy for anyone doing a lot of wordprocessing and documentation.
    
    System Requirements: 64K, one disk drive and monochrome display
    
    How to Start: To run, enter its filename, e.g., for WORDS.EXE
    enter WORDS and press <ENTER>.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $15.95
