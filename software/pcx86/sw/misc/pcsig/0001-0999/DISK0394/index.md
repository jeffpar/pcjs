## Information about "MATH PAK III"

    MATH PAK III is a set of tutorials to help improve your problem-solving
    skills plus mathematical conversion routines to speed up some math
    operations.
    
    It contains a range of tutorials -- from the very basic arithmetic
    functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to
    solving quadratic equations, computing geometries and understanding trig
    functions.  MATH PAK III will also read your own data files to solve
    quadratic equations, derivatives, linear equations, DEC-BIN-HEX-OCT
    conversions, trig functions, determinants and more.
    
    It offers 80x87 math coprocessor support, context-sensitive help
    screens, fast execution and printing of trig tables and sample problems
    to solve.  Registration includes a 50 page manual with examples and
    solved problems.
    
    This set of programs can be used as an educational program to help
    expand your knowledge and appreciation of mathematics.

MATH PAK III v1.0 (C) 1990 Dalal Publishing Co.

MATH PAK III v1.0 offers the following options to the PC user:

-automatic 80x87 support
-clear, consise help screens, with context sensitive help using the F1 key
-menu driven
-standalone program, in .EXE form. Needs no other software or compilers to run
-decimal-hexidecimal-binary-octal base conversions
-quadratic equation solving
-chain rule solving for derivatives
-first and second derivative solving for polynomials

Also included with the MATH PAK III main program (MPK3.EXE), are these three
programs/utilities:

MATH PAK III Data File Utility - This program allows the user to use his own
ASCII data files to solve for quadratic equations, linear equations and first
and second derivative solutions.

MATH PAK III Problem Solving Utility - This program allows the user to print
out to an on-line printer, selected problems to work out. These include problems
in base conversions, additions, subtraction, multiplication, fractions, word
problems, a trig table and much more. NEEDS 80x87 chip to work.

MATH PAK III Test File Utility - This program will test your ASCII data files
for proper syntax, in terms of alpha characters, etc. and tell you if the 
file will be compatable with the MATH PAK III Data File Utility.

Registration: US $9.95 plus US $ 3.00 for shipping and handling. You will
receive a 50+ page manual, showing examples, solved problems and how to use
the programs to their full potential.
