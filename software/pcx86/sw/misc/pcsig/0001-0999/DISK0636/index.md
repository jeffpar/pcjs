## Information about "MUSES 2 OF 2 (ALSO 635)"

    MUSE is a specialized database for authors and agents to organize the
    circulation of manuscripts to publishers, especially useful when
    sending multiple or simultaneous submissions. Keep track of queries,
    submissions, publishers' responses, acceptances and publications, as
    well as current mailings. Review the status of any manuscript at any
    publisher at any time. Mail merge the address in the files with
    appropriate form letters and print letters on one printer and
    envelopes on another.
