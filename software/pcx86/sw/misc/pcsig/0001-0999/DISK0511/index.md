## Information about "TURBO SPRITES"

    Turbo Sprites and Animation is a series of utilities, library files
    and demo programs to create, maintain and animate sprites (user-
    defined graphics images) in the Turbo Pascal environment.  Both
    multi-page animation and xor animation are supported.  Three main
    parts:
    
    DESIGNER.COM is a sprite-designing utility which has an editor-like
    environment for creating sprites.  It also allows you to store them in
    tables of up to 24 sprites.  The utility will also generate code
    allowing you to incorporate sprites in your programs as typed
    constants.
    
    COMPOSER.COM is a screen and animation composing utility that will
    help in positioning the sprites for display.
    
    SPRITES.LIB is a library of display routines for sprites.  A number of
    demo programs have been included to be sure you understand how to use
    the sprite files.  Along with the demo programs, there are a number of
    sprite tables that have already been created.
    
    System Requirements: 256K, one disk drive and monochrome/graphics
    display; Turbo Pascal compiler.
    
    How to Start:  From the DOS prompt enter TYPE READTHIS.NOW and
    follow directions.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $20.00
