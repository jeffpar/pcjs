## Information about "BASIC XREF"

    The BASIC CROSS REFERENCE UTILITY is for the serious BASIC
    programmer.  It helps in the programming and debugging of BASIC source
    language programs by building a complete cross-reference of all
    variables.
    
    The utility provides list of the the following:  all line numbers,
    showing all references by other statements; an alphabetic listing of
    all reserved words and line numbers where they appear; an alphabetic
    listing of all variables that are not reserved; and a listing of the
    BASIC source which might include both numbered and un-numbered
    statements.  You can remove unreferenced statement numbers from
    compiled programs, remove REM statements from the source code, and
    unprotect source programs saved as protected programs.
