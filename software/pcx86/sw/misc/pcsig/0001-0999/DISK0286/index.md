## Information about "PC-VT"

    PC-VT is a software emulator which makes the IBM PC function as a DEC
    VT102 or a VT100 Video Terminal.  PC-VT emulates most VT100/102

    with larger mainframes, or services that would normally only be
    available to access by a dedicated terminal.  It's like having a
