## Information about "SPRITE GRAPPHICS"

    There are several unrelated programs on this disk.  SPRITE is a user-
    supported program which lets you conveniently create Sprite charaters.
    A Sprite character is a graphics figure made from a set of colored
    pixels.  Instead of displaying this figure pixel by pixel, BASIC lets
    you display the figure in one step with the graphics form of the PUT
    statement.  This is similar to the Sprite graphics available on other
    microcomputers.  Other files included are various files to explain how
    to unprotect some popular software.  A benchmark is here as well as a
    program to prints foreign language characters on an EPSON printer.
    
    System Requirements: Some programs require color, BASIC
    
    How to Start:  Load DOS and type SPRITE to enter the main program.  To
    run BASIC programs consult the directions in GETTING STARTED for your
    configuration.  Consult the .DOC files for additional information.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $20.00
