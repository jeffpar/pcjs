## Information about "HERITAGE CHURCH SYSTEM"

    HERITAGE CHURCH SYSTEM is designed to automate the most mundane
    clerical tasks of the local church. Record and access contributions
    and membership information in a quick and concise manner. Entries can
    be made for families in general and for each individual in a family.
    
    Each entry includes the name, address, phone, and church status. An
    envelope number can be entered if pre-numbered envelopes are used for
    recording family giving. Contributions are entered separately and the
    program then processes the data in a weekly accounting system and
    prints contribution reports for each family.
    
    Mail merge capabilities work with PC-WRITE and Microsoft WORD,
    allowing mass mailings to the congregations.
