## Information about "THE FRONT OFFICE 2 OF 3 (ALSO 697, 2311)"

    Open the door to more opportunity with THE FRONT OFFICE (TFO).  TFO is
    a marketing and sales productivity system for prospecting and lead
    tracking, telemarketing and call reporting, follow-up and sales
    performance.
    
    TFO is menu-driven and uses a single data-entry system for all data.
    Data entered in one area is automatically copied to all other
    applicable areas -- cutting down on data-entry costs, time, and
    errors.  It comes with its own word processor and works with others, as
    well.
    
    Letters, envelopes, labels, and reports are selectively produced by
    prospect code, salesperson code, zip code, follow-up date, customer
    code, product code, or your own user-defined fields for efficient and
    flexible prospect tracking and follow-up.  Call reports include
    telephone time, sales forecasts, and potential sales volume for
    management analysis and sales support.
