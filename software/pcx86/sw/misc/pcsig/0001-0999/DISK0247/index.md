## Information about "BOBCAT"

    BOBCAT is a database of small business computer information.  Reviews,
    tutorials, general articles, buying guides, even ads on special
    products that apply to small businesses are listed.  The database may
    be searched by any combination of category, subject, form, product or
    company name.  BOBCAT is distributed as user-supported software in Jim
