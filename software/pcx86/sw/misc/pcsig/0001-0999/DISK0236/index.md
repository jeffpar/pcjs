## Information about "PRINTER UTILITIES"

    FPRINT's purpose is to print ASCII files, but with certain safeguards
    built-in for your convenience.  For instance, a check will be made to
    see if it is indeed an ASCII file.  If the program thinks you are
    trying to print a non-ASCII file, it will pause and tell you so.  You
    then have the option to cancel your print request, or continue anyway.
    FPRINT also has a printer setup menu which can be useful for regular
    print jobs when you want specific printer settings.  This can be very
    useful with the accompanying set of tables for using the Toshiba
    printer with Volkswriter Deluxe.  The program converts the IBM codes
    into Toshiba codes and allows the user to use the various types of
    printer programs with ease.
    
    System Requirements:  Toshiba printer with Volkswriter
    
    How to Start: Consult the .DOC and README files for
    directions and documentation.  To run the BASIC programs, consult
    the directions in GETTING STARTED for your configuration.  To run
    a program suffixed .COM or .EXE, just type its name, i.e., for
    FPRINTF.EXE, type FRPINT and press <ENTER>.
    
    Suggested Registration: $15.00 to $25.00 for Volkswriter to Toshiba.
