## Information about "ADVENTUREWARE"

    A fistful of text adventure games, ranging from a mystery adventure, to
    an episode of espionage, to a tale of horror.  If you enjoy the
    challenge of puzzles and exploring the unknown, then you will be
    occupied for days with this quintet:
    
    CRIME: Solve a crime and be a hero! You find yourself embattled in a
    world where the streets are not safe. Keep your back to the wall and
    look for allies!
    
    HAUNTED MISSION: While on his way to a party, the world-famous Pumpkin
    Man was shanghaied by the evil Lady Winslow. Search the neighborhood,
    rescue him, and take him to the party.
    
    ISLAND OF MYSTERY: Explore a tiny island in the middle of a vast ocean
    in search of 11 treasures.  Locate each and then find the secret place
    where they must be stored.
    
    THE NUCLEAR SUBMARINE ADVENTURE: To add to the growing threat of
    nuclear proliferation, the USS Nautilus has been reactivated and totally
    refitted with the most modern and lethal equipment. As a new crewman
    aboard the Nautilus, you have received extensive training but experience
    is still the best teacher, and you will learn much more during your stay
    onboard -- if you survive!
    
    TERROR IN THE ICE CAVERNS: The Soviets are developing a new death laser
    in the remote, frigid caves of Antarctica. Your mission (should you
    choose to accept it), is to enter the caves and the Soviet complex,
    locate the laser, steal the plans for it and then return to the surface
    to be picked up by a helicopter. Where are your mittens?
