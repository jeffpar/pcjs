## Information about "FANSI-CONSOLE 2 OF 2 (ALSO 356)"

    A sophisticated memory-resident program which replaces the standard IBM
    PC console drivers.
    
    Full support is provided for:  IBM PS/2 product line for both video and
    keyboard;  VGA and Super-EGA, including 132 column and 60 row display
    drivers; enhanced 101/102 key keyboards, including foreign and ``Brand
    X'' keyboards.
    
    FANSI-CONSOLE extends and speeds up the ROM BIOS and processes ANSI
    X3.64 control sequences.  Keyboard macros are supported -- program
    specific keys to perform complex series of keystokes.  Reconfigure your
    keyboard however you wish -- even a Dvorak layout.  Experiment with
    different drivers.
