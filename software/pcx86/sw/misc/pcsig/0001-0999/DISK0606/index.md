## Information about "POLYMATH"

    POLYMATH is a programming language much like Forth in structure, and
    developed to bridge the gap between programmable calculators and
    personal computer languages.  Anyone in the scientific or technical
    fields will find this program extremely useful for its number-handling
    abilities and ease of use.
    
    This language works much like the Hewlett Packard programmable
    calculator and can be used as a calculator.  Those familiar with the HP
    Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) know how simply complex formulas can be
    entered into the calculator.  POLYMATH uses this same scheme, but with
    defined words or functions.  Most words are defined with very simple
    tasks and then used and integrated with other words to build more
    powerful functions.  An entire programming dictionary of function words
    can then be developed.
    
    POLYMATH has a wide variety of applications and special uses.  It has
    strong on-line documentation which takes the first-time user through a
    menu-driven tutorial.  It also has files that explain the syntax
    and use of any word currently in its main dictionary.
    
    Included are a few dictionaries and application programs.  A review of
    these programs will be very helpful when learning the language.  It
    also features full graphics to round out the package.
