## Information about "BATCH FILE UTILITIES"

    Batch files are tireless worker files. Once written and tested to insure

    with no slip-ups, complaints, or fatigue.

    also to enhance the batch file capabilities of your DOS operating
    system. Source code is included thoughout, making it possible to read or
    print out any of the files included. A lot of the material here would be
    pertinent to programmmers or advanced users who wanted to soup-up their
    systems with hard-working batch files.
