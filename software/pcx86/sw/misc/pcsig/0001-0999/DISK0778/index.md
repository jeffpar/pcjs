## Information about "PSEUDOSAM CROSS ASSEMBLER 80Z AND 85"

    PSEUDOSAM 80z and 85 are machine language cross-assembler programs for
    the ZILOG z80, NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR NSC800, and the INTEL 8085
    microprocessors.  These programs let you construct 80z and 8085
    code on your IBM PC, to be transferred to an 80z or 8085-based system
    for use.
    
    The PSEUDOSAM (Pseudo-brand Symbolic AsseMbler) assemblers conform to
    common syntax, based on the UNIX System V assembler syntax.  The opcode
    and addressing syntax is compatible with the manufacturer's, but label,
    directive, and expression operator syntax will differ.
    
    The author of PSEUDOSAM chose this syntax because of UNIX's popularity,
    and to avoid the problem of maintaining compatibility with the many OEM
    assemblers.  The documentation is well organized and easy to
    understand, although no attempt is made to teach 80z or 8085
    programming.  You should have a good understanding of machine
    language programming and also be familiar with basic DOS functions.
