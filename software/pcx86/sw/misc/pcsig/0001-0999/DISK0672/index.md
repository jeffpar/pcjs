    You may create your own headings for taxable and non-taxable additions
    to pay and post-tax deductions. You may produce lists of deductions
    under these headings. (Year-end documentation includes P35 and P60
    forms, also obtainable from author.) The system accommodates
    statutory sick pay, and password protection. The user may change tax
    rates and bandwidths, as well as earnings brackets.
    
    Each employee may have attached to his record card, in addition to basic
    pay and hours, any regularly occuring payment or deduction. During
    entry of pay data, only these employees will have the variables entered.
    Calculation of pay and deductions is very flexible,
    permitting recalculation if necessary.
