## Information about "COMPUSERVE AND BBS UTILITIES"

    This disk has two sections.  The first is about Compuserve, the
    mainframe BBS, and the second is just BBS's in general.  The
    information about the CompuServe commands was downloaded in
    December, 1983.  It uses a menu approach to information selection
    and display.  Most features of the service are available through
    page-numbered menus.
    
    How to Start: As these are text files for information and help in
    using CompuServ, first scan and then print what you need.  To scan:
    enter from the prompt TYPE A:<filename>.  To Print, enter: PRINT
    A:<filename>.
