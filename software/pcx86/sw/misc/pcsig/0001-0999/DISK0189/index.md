## Information about "TECH PRINT"

    TechPrint is an inexpensive and remarkably easy-to-use program for doing
    technical word processing on PCs linked with dot matrix printers.
    TechPrint is currently designed to work with WordStar and Epson
    printers.  It supports special characters and character sets,
    strikeovers, superscripting, and subscripting.  It comes with an
    excellent on-disk manual done in WordStar (sorry--so get an UNWS!).
    
    System Requirements: Epson printer, DOS 2.0 or later, and WordStar.
    
    How to Start: Consult the TECH.MNL for directions and documentation.
    To run TechPrint, type TECH and press <ENTER>.
