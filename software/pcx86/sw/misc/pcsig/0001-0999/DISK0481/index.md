## Information about "STILL RIVER SHELL"

    The STILL RIVER SHELL provides an intuitive interface with your system
    that MS/PC-DOS has never provided the user.
    
    Typical DOS functions of execute, find, copy, move, delete, or list are
    completed with significantly fewer keystrokes while still providing
    access to all DOS commands. It gives you a more comfortable and
    informative operating environment than DOS alone, and the friendly,
    visible nature of the display can actually help the new user to better
    understand the operating system.
    
    Get things done with greater speed and precision. After all, isn't that
    the point of computing?
