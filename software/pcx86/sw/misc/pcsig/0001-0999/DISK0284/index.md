## Information about "LABEL MAKER"

    A simple menu-driven labelmaker, perfect for novices.  Print labels for
    your library of floppies on the labels that come with your blank
    diskettes.
    
    The program automatically reads and prints all file names,
    subdirectories, a large title, up to eight lines of comments, the date,
    number of files, disk format, and bytes used/free on three different
    5.25 inchdiskette label sizes (3 1/2 x 15/16, 4 x 1 7/16, and 5 x 1
    7/16) and on two 3.5 inch diskette label sizes ( 2 3/4 x 2 3/4 and 2 3/4
    x 1 15/16).
    
    Options include printing multiple labels, and printing without listing
    file names. Supports LQ printers as well as Epson dot matrix printers,
    the IBM Proprinter or Graphics printer, and compatibles.  Will also work
    on any printer capable of enlarged and compressed print modes.
    Printer, screen colors, label size, size of title, and other options can
    be configured to your specifications.
