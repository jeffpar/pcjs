## Information about "LIFE FORMS (LIFE CYCLE GENERATION)"

    LIFE FORMS is an enhanced version of the "Game of Life," developed by
    mathematician John Conway.  The program creates a video pattern that
    evolves like biological cells, according to a certain growth rate. Many
    features have been added to Conway's simple game, including eight extra
    growth rules for producing whole new families of screen images.
    
    LIFE FORMS is simple to use, with lots of on-screen help and self-
    explanatory menus.  The "life forms" that you create can be stored,
    retrieved, edited, and deleted.  More than 100 life patterns are
    supplied on the program disk, with room for 240 in all.  You can
    "capture a specimen from the zoo," or design a life form according to
    your own specifications.
    
    Control many factors that influence the growth cycle: complexity of
    development, species, pigmentation, habitat and original seed shape.
    There is a library of seed patterns which have been specifically chosen
    for the interesting results that they tend to produce.  Choose one of
    these, edit it or devise your own seed form.  As your life form starts
    to grow, control how fast each growth step is displayed on the screen
    and even pause your life form's development.
