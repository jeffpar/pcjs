## Information about "TODO (MR. LABEL NOW ON DISK 1673)"

    Keep a ``things to do'' list in your computer and in your pocket where
    you need it.
    
    Each item or activity is a maximum of 38 characters to insure that the
    printout will fit into a daily diary or ``day-timer''-type format.  TODO
    automatically loads your list of up to 100 items when you run the
    program and stores any changes you make on the list.  When you finish,
    TODO sorts your items by due date first, then by priority, then by key.
    If this sort pattern does not fit your needs, you can customize it.
