## Information about "MESSAGE MASTER AND ADDRESS BOOK"

    Provide a message center in your computer.  Several users of the same
    computer can leave messages and notes to each other.
    
    Type, read, and delete messages of up to 1,000 characters using the
    Send and Read routines.  MAIL lists the names of the people who have
    messages waiting for them and can be set up to be executed when the
    computer is first turned on.  Although MESSAGE MASTER has limited text
    editing capabilities and no password protection, it is very easy to use
    and keeps a record of all messages sent until they are deleted.
    
    ADDRESS BOOK is an efficient way to keep the names, addresses, and phone
    numbers of your customers and vendors in good order and up-to-date.  It
    is designed for a small to mid-sized company.  Included is a way to add,
    edit and delete your addresses, and a printer menu to print any or all
    of your addresses.  Keep track of your personal and business address and
    telephone lists with ease.
