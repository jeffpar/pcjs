## Information about "DO-IT-YOURSELF PROMO KIT"

    Why send a piece of cardboard or paper to express your feelings, when
    you can send a disk that plays music? What a birthday surprise!
    
    These programs are a perfect replacement for traditional birthday and
    Christmas cards -- they play music and greet the recipient. With the
    included editor, you can write your own cards for any occasion. They
    run on either a monochrome or color system, without the need for a
    graphics card.
    
    Add that personal touch that people never forget!
