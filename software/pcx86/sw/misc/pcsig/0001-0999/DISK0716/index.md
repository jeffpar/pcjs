## Information about "CHURCH PROSPECT INFO SYSTEM"

    CHURCH PROSPECT INFORMATION SYSTEM will help you keep track of your
    members -- or clients, or customers, or even your friends.  This is
    good for your church, office, grocery store, bowling alley, etc.  You
    can categorize data in a variety of ways and make searches.  A typical
    profile might contain a person's name, address, marital status, birth
    date, home and work phone numbers, number of children, employer and
    occupation, church status, and date of last visit.  All you need to do
    is fill in the blanks, and then you can modify, print, or browse
    through a file.  You can also add additional commentary to each
    personal profile, letting you include information about hobbies,
    special skills and interests, and such.  This program can print
    alphabetical listings, profile data sheets, visitation worksheets, and
    contact/decision sheets.  The latter shows the type of prospect, how
    contacted, number of contacts, and number of decisions.  This version
    is limited to 35 profiles.
