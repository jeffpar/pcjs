## Information about "C TUTOR 1 OF 2 (ALSO 578)"

    C TUTOR is a comprehensive instructional course for the C programming
    language which assumes the user has a moderate amount of programming
    experience.
    
    The C source code is included for each of several examples discussed
    throughout the tutorial.  These examples are meant to be studied and
    then compiled and run by the student.  The examples are short and focus
    on specific topics.
    
    All of the points of C language, including properly-structured
    programming techniques, are covered at the elementary level.  The
    description and instruction are applicable to most compilers with some
    slight differences.
