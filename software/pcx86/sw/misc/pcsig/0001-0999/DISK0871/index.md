## Information about "FILE FRIEND AND FANCY LABEL MAKER"

    FILEFRIEND is a memory-resident file manager which can display files
    from up to 10 disks and subdirectories; add or remove files from the
    listed directory; sort by name, extension, date, time, size, or path;
    scroll through the directory or tag files to copy, rename, delete,
    type, dump, or change file attributes.
    
    All commands are quickly executed by the ten function keys and the
    bottom line of the screen will display the options available to you.
    The top line of the screen shows the free disk space.  View the
    date/time or change them.
    
    Edit your DOS commands as you enter them, keeping your five previous
    commands in a buffer, allowing you to go back and execute a command
    without having to reenter it. A log of your 20 last commands are shown
    on the right side of the screen.
    
    Most computer users have a need for a simple utility which can print
    their labels for them.  And whether those labels are going to be used
    on disks, letters, or something else, FANCY LABEL is the program for
    you.
    
    Save and retrieve a specific label and print as many copies as you want.
    All the labels are saved into a data file on the drive of your choice.
    For each line you may choose either normal, double width, condensed,
    normal compressed, or double compressed.  Each print style can be
    either
    in italics or regular print mode.
    
    FANCY LABEL is designed to work with single-feed fanfold labels.  You
    can use either 3-1/2" x 15/16" labels, on which you can print up to
    five lines, or 4" x 7/16" labels, on which you can print up to eight
    lines per label.
