## Information about "SYMPHONY MACROS AND WORDPROS. TIPS"

    This disk contains a variety of prize-winning tips and Macros for
    SYMPHONY, including tips on importing wordprocessor files, Multiplan
    files, using SIDEKICK with SYMPHONY, and much more.  In addition to
    great tips, there are also worksheets for creating a phone and address
    directory, creating and printing mailling labels, creating macros, and
    setting up multi-column documents.  Utilities perform hexadecimal to
    decimal conversions (and vice versa), simulation of 123 window
    sychronization capability, calculation of metric values of resistance
    and tolerance of resistors.  Also included is a macro demonstration and
    macro tips using the {get} function.  These utilities seem to solve
    many of the conversion problems for major programs (WordStar, etc.).
    
    System Requirements:  512K, two disk drives, monochrome display and
    Lotus SYMPHONY
    
    How to Start:  Access through Lotus Symphony
