## Information about "UNCLE"

    UNCLE provides analysis of four different possible tax strategies
    simultaneously.  All four alternate form 1040s are on screen at the
    same time.  This version even has an on-screen RPN calculator!  UNCLE
    was professionally written for annuity and life brokers, and financial
    planners; they had no method of properly interpreting and illustrating
    certain obscure sections of the tax code, lacked computer savvy, and
    who couldn't adequately illustrate the concepts of tax planning and
    pension maximization.
    
    The user projects taxes for the current year (to be prepared NEXT
    year) using a full 1040 input format and then tries alternative
    scenarios using four columns on a single screen (inputs need only be
    entered once).  W-4 changes for one or two combined wage earners may
    be calculated to correspond to whatever part of the tax is targeted
    for prepayment and what has already been prepaid.  Pocket expense of
    investment and paycheck changes are shown.
    
    System Requirements: 256K, two disk drives and a monochrome/graphics
    display
    
    How to Start: Documentation is found in files PART1, PART2 and CALCKEY;
    as it is written using PC-WRITE, if possible use that program to print
    it.  To run: after loading DOS, enter INTRO or UNCLE and press <ENTER>.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $40.00 (includes full manual, update of Tax
    Analysis module and telephone support)
