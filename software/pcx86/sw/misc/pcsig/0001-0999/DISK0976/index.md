## Information about "MANAGEMENT ACTION EXPERT"

    MAE (Management Action Expert) is an expert system shell that can solve
    problems in a non-procedural manner from an application of rules and
    facts about a problem.
    
    MAE reads a file known as a "knowledge base," and asks you a series of
    questions to determine the cause of the problem. Based on the answers
    and the information in the knowledge base, a recommended course of
    action is given.
    
    Create your own knowledge base with a few simple commands and use the
    program for a variety of applications.
