## Information about "QUANTOIDS, RESCUE, & LOTTERY FUN"

    To the Spaceport!  If we don't hunt these madmen down, they'll destroy
    life as we know it today!
    
    (C'mon, admit it. Would you want your daughter to marry an accountant
    or... Heaven forbid... an MBA?!  Do you want your grandchildren
    calculating ROI?! Aha, I thought not!)
    
    We must fight together and track down the QUANTOIDS OF NEBULOUS IV!!
    
    You find yourself looking out the cockpit of your spacecraft while
    controlling ship maneuvers, varying your speed and firing at the enemy
    ships, filled with those nefarious bean-counters intent on enslaving
    us!
    
    Look out! They have COMPUTERS!!
    
    Keep track of all the winning numbers and numbers you have bet in "6/49"
    lottery games.  Get a list whenever you need it. Source code included
    for the tinkerer.
    
    A variation on the classic "Lunar Lander" theme.
    
    Launch from Earth, maneuver your ship to dock with a space station,
    transfer the crew, return and land, preferably safely, on Earth again.
    
    There are only a few commands to learn, which is good.  You're not going
    to have a lot of time for practice.  You'll be too busy trying to stay
    alive.  Heads up!
