## Information about "SYSCOMM"

    This is an excellent menu-driven communications package.  It comes in
    three parts:
    
    SYSCOMM is a general purpose comunications package.  It can comunicate
    with other computers, transfer files, and act as your window to the
    world when connected to one of the information networks.  Several
    features of SYSCOMM make it easy to connect with other systems,
    including auto-dialing and auto-logon.
    
    ABSCOMM is a special purpose program used for un-attended file transfer.
    Jobs are submitted to ABSCOMM to place calls at certain times of the
    day and to send a list of files to the remote computer. The times can
    be selected to take advantage of the lower phone rates. ABSCOMM is also
    the un-attended answering software used when another system running
    SYSCOMM or ABSCOMM wants to send you a file.
    
    EDCOMM is a supplemental program.  SYSCOMM and ABSCOMM have data files
    that contain initializa- tion parameters and phone directories. EDCOMM
    allows the user to alter the initialization parameters and manage the
    phone directories.  An additional feature is used to create auto-logon
    sequences for SYSCOMM.
    
    How to Start:  From DOS, enter EXPAND for a hard copy of the
    documentation.  All the programs (marked .EXE) run from DOS.
    
    Suggested Registration: $70.00 gets you telephone support, a printed
    manual, and free updates for two years
