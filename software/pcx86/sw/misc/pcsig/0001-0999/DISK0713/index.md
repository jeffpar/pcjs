## Information about "COMPUTER CONTRACT BRIDGE"

    COMPUTER CONTRACT BRIDGE is played by two teams, the we team and the
    they team.  The we team consists of the North and the South.  The
    computer is North and you're South.  The they team consists of the East
    and the West, both played by the computer.  All your interactions with
    your computer opponents are done through the keyboard, and you'll
    generally get a prompt on the screen to tell you what to do next.  If
    you pay attention to the prompts and follow their lead, you will have no
    trouble playing.  The computer plays a fairly good game, but in time you
    can learn how to win.  This particular version of the program is meant
    for the novice bridge player.  Though it is a game and not a tutorial,
    you will definitely learn a lot by playing it.
