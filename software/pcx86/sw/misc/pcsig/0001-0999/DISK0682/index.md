    PC-TYPE II, Jim Button's supercharged new version of PC-TYPE, comes
    equipped to help you easily create impressive documents.
    
    Not just a simple wordprocessor anymore, PC-TYPE II now comes equipped
    with all the standard wordprocessing functions, plus many advanced
    features.  These include a mail merge that works hand-in-hand with PC-
    File databases, WordStar files, and straight ASCII files; a 100,000-
    word fault finder that checks for misspellings; and a ``whoops'' key to
    recover up to 15 lost or deleted lines.  Automatically reformat files.
    You can also create multiple column, newspaper-style documents.
    
    You can graph your data within PC-TYPE II by creating bar or pie charts
    and scatter diagrams.  Also, multiple variables can be graphed and
    accumulated.  Save up to 25 macros per file to eliminate repetitive
    keystrokes.  An extensive on-line help system provides all the support
    you need to produce professional work.
