## Information about "TYPING BY RYSOFT"

    Get those fingers of yours warmed up!  Here is a new test for them.
    TYPING is an easy-to-use program that gives feedback on your
    typing performance.  It displays the text on the screen, and you start
    typing -- quickly, now! -- and no mistakes!  The timer starts as soon as
    you hit the first key.
    
    TYPING does not display any statistics while you are typing.  When the
    timer runs out, the screen clears and your typing performance is
    displayed in words per minute, total errors, and adjusted words per
    minute.  The nice thing about TYPING is you can either type from
    the screen or print the test file and type from that.  You can
    also supply your own file to type if you want.
