I've uploaded the [Guide](https://archive.org/details/karel-the-robot-guide-1984-01) for "Karel the Robot" to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/@jeffpar).  Here's an excerpt:

> Let's Meet Karel!

    This small robot is well known to fame,
    He is clever, and Karel is his name;
    If you are his pal,
    He will teach you PASCAL,
    And turn programming into a game.

    --Isaac Asimov
      February 7, 1983

> Throughout this course, a friendly robot named Karel helps you explore the world of programming. The concepts in this Guide--as well as Karelâ€™s programming language, sample programs, and many programming tasks--are explained in detail in the [textbook](https://archive.org/details/karel-the-robot). Use the textbook, along with this Guide, as you experiment with the different parts of the Karel System.

The software was distributed on three 360Kb non-DOS diskettes, so no directory listings are available.
