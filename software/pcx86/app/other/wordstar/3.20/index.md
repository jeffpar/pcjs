[Directory Listings](#directory-of-wordstar-320-original) of original single-sided (160Kb)
WordStar 3.20 diskettes are provided below.  Before we acquired the originals, all we had was a
disk image recreated by [The OS/2 Museum](http://www.os2museum.com/).  We have retained both
sets of files for comparison purposes.

The same May 2019 acquisition included:

- WordStar 3.2 General Information Manual
- WordStar 3.0 Reference Card
- WordStar 3.2 Reference Manual
- WordStar 3.2 Technical Information
- WordStar 3.0 Training Guide (20 lessons)
- Official WordStar MicroPro Binder
