Microsoft Multiplan 2.00
------------------------

NOTE: The Microsoft Multiplan 2.00 disk below is *not* an original distribution disk.  It was obtained from
[VETUSWARE](https://vetusware.com/download/Multiplan%202%20FR/?id=3417) and contains a pre-installed copy of
`MP.COM`.  No installation files were included with the disk.

The disk also includes [Microsoft Mouse 4.00](/disks/pcx86/tools/microsoft/mouse/4.00/) driver files.  They match
the 4.00 distribution files, even though they have been time-stamped with the same date as the Multiplan files.
