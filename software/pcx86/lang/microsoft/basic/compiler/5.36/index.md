The only version of the Microsoft BASIC Compiler we have added to the project so far is
[v5.36](#directory-of-ms-basic-compiler-536), a 1984 release from our private disk collection.
It is not an original distribution disk, and it contains a number of unrelated files, including sample files
from a demo version of BetterBASIC, a competing product from Summit Software Technology, Inc.

See the [IBM BASIC Compiler](/software/pcx86/lang/ibm/basic/compiler/1.00/), which was also produced by Microsoft.
