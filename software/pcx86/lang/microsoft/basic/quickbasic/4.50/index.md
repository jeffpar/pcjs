    ================================================================================
    Part 1: Using QuickBASIC on a Two-Floppy System
    ================================================================================


    Installing QuickBASIC on Floppy Disks
    -------------------------------------

    The SETUP program can install QuickBASIC on floppy disks for use
    with a two-floppy system. You must run SETUP to install QuickBASIC
    on floppy disks. You cannot run QuickBASIC from the disks provided,
    because the files are stored in a compressed format.

    Before you install QuickBASIC on your two-floppy system, be sure
    you have enough blank, formatted disks. If you have 360K disk
    drives, you will need five blank disks. For 720K disk drives, you
    will need three blank disks.

    To install QuickBASIC, put Disk #1 in drive A. Type A:\SETUP and
    press Enter.

    When your installation is complete, you should label each disk with
    the names of the files that are on that disk. QuickBASIC will ask
    you to swap disks when it cannot find a file that it needs, and
    you will need to know which disk the file is on.

    If you use 360K disks, label them as follows:

    PROGRAM:
    QB.EXE		 QB45QCK.HLP

    UTILITIES:
    BC.EXE		 LINK.EXE
    BQLB45.LIB		 LIB.EXE
    BRUN45.EXE		 QB.QLB
    BRUN45.LIB		 QB.LIB

    UTILITIES 2:
    BCOM45.LIB		 QB45ENER.HLP

    ADVISOR:
    QB45ADVR.HLP

    EXAMPLES
    QB.BI			 BASIC examples

    If you use 720K disks, label them as follows:

    PROGRAM/EXAMPLES:
    QB.EXE		 QB45QCK.HLP
    QB.BI			 BASIC examples

    UTILITIES:
    BC.EXE		 LINK.EXE
    BQLB45.LIB		 LIB.EXE
    BRUN45.EXE		 QB.QLB
    BRUN45.LIB		 QB.LIB
    BCOM45.LIB

    ADVISOR:
    QB45ADVR.HLP		 QB45ENER.HLP


    Running QuickBASIC from Floppy Disks
    ------------------------------------

    During some operations, QuickBASIC asks you to swap disks one
    or more times. You can minimize disk swapping by following the
    procedures in this section.

    Since the disks that you installed QuickBASIC on are nearly full, you
    should keep your BASIC source-code (.BAS) files on a separate disk.
    Label this disk SOURCE.

    Copy the run-time module BRUN45.EXE from the UTILITIES disk to your
    SOURCE disk. QuickBASIC needs this file to run executable programs
    compiled with the run-time support option.

    When you use QuickBASIC, a disk containing source-code (.BAS) files
    should always be in drive B. If you want to run existing BASIC
    programs (such as the example programs provided with QuickBASIC),
    remove the SOURCE disk from drive B and insert the disk containing
    these files.

    To run QuickBASIC:

    1. Insert the SOURCE disk in drive B.

    2. To make drive B the current drive, type B: and press Enter.

    3. Insert the PROGRAM disk (the disk containing QB.EXE) in drive A.

    4. Type the following command:

    A:QB.EXE

    To insure that QuickBASIC always looks on both disk drives for the
    files it needs, follow these steps:

    1. From the Options menu, choose Set Paths.

    2. Make sure each of the path settings includes both disk drives. The
    following line should be in all four text boxes:

    A:\;B:\

    3. Choose OK.

    QuickBASIC saves these path settings in the QB.INI file, so you will
    not have to enter them again.

    When you exit QuickBASIC or shell to DOS, you will be prompted to
    insert a disk containing the file COMMAND.COM. Remove the PROGRAM
    disk from drive A, insert a system disk, and press Enter.


    Using Help from Floppy Disks
    ----------------------------

    When you use the QuickBASIC Advisor online help system, you may need
    to swap disks. For example, if you choose "Details" or "Example" on a
    help screen, QuickBASIC will inform you that it cannot find the help
    file QB45ADVR.HLP. Put the disk that contains this file in drive A and
    choose Retry.


    Compiling Your Programs from Floppy Disks
    -----------------------------------------

    To compile your program from within QuickBASIC:

    1. From the Run menu, choose Make EXE File.

    2. Choose Make EXE. QuickBASIC displays the message "Cannot find file
    (BC.EXE)."

    3. Insert the UTILITIES disk (the disk containing BC.EXE) in drive A.
    Type A: and press Enter.

    If the program compiles successfully, QuickBASIC invokes the LINK
    utility. If LINK cannot find the library, it displays the following
    message:

    LINK : warning L4051 : BCOM45.LIB : cannot find library
    Enter new file spec:

    4. Insert the disk containing the requested library (BCOM45.LIB or
    BRUN45.LIB) in drive A.

    Note: The requested library may be located on the UTILITIES disk
    already in drive A. If this is the case, leave this disk in drive A.

    5. Type A: and press Enter. After the LINK utility finishes creating
    your executable program, QuickBASIC displays the message "Cannot
    find file (QB.EXE)."

    6. Insert the PROGRAM disk in drive A.

    7. Type A: and press Enter.

    If no errors occur during compiling or linking, your compiled program
    (.EXE) is created on drive B. QuickBASIC also creates an object-module
    (.OBJ) file. To save space, you can delete object-module files.


    ================================================================================
    Part 2:  Using Your Mouse with QuickBASIC
    ================================================================================


    New Mouse Driver for Use with QuickBASIC
    ----------------------------------------

    QuickBASIC Version 4.5 can be used with any mouse that is 100%
    compatible with the Microsoft Mouse. However, you must use a
    Microsoft Mouse driver Version 6.00 or later. Earlier versions may
    cause unpredictable behavior when used with QuickBASIC. MOUSE.COM,
    Version 6.24 is supplied with QuickBASIC Version 4.5.

    Especially if you are writing programs that use the mouse, you
    should use the supplied version of the mouse driver when working in
    QuickBASIC. Previous versions have included MOUSE.SYS, which is
    installed by including the line DEVICE=MOUSE.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS
    file. This version of QuickBASIC includes MOUSE.COM, which is not
    installed via CONFIG.SYS. To install MOUSE.COM, just type MOUSE at
    the DOS prompt. To include MOUSE.COM automatically when your machine
    boots, make sure MOUSE.COM is in your search path, then put the line

    MOUSE

    in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. To free up memory, you can remove the
    mouse driver at any time by typing MOUSE OFF at the DOS prompt.
    This will restore between 9K and 10.5K of memory with Version 6.11.


    Using Mouse Function Calls from QuickBASIC Programs
    ---------------------------------------------------

    If you are programming for the Microsoft Mouse, you should obtain
    the Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference Guide and the library
    MOUSE.LIB that comes with it. (These are not included in QuickBASIC
    or Mouse package and must be ordered separately). Most of the
    information in the Mouse Programmer's Reference Guide applies
    directly to QuickBASIC Version 4.5. However, the following additional
    restrictions must be observed:

    Certain Mouse function calls (Functions 9 & 16) require you to set
    up an integer array and pass the address of the array to the mouse
    driver. For previous versions, the only restriction on this array
    was that it had to be $STATIC (the default array type). In QuickBASIC
    Version 4.5, however, the array also must be in a COMMON block if you
    will be making the Mouse function call from within the QuickBASIC
    environment.  In addition, it is recommended that the support code
    for the Mouse call be in a Quick library or linked into the
    executable file when making Mouse function calls from QuickBASIC.

    To produce a Quick library for using Mouse function calls from
    within the QuickBASIC environment, use the following command line
    (produces MOUSE.QLB):

    LINK MOUSE.LIB/QU,MOUSE.QLB,,BQLB40.LIB/NOE;

    An example from PIANO.BAS (included with the Microsoft Mouse
    Programmer's Reference) for using Mouse function call 9:

    DEFINT A-Z
    DECLARE SUB MOUSE (M1, M2, M3, M4)
    DIM Cursor(15, 1)
    COMMON Cursor() 'Ensures array data is in DGROUP
    .
    .  (set up Cursor() for mouse cursor shape desired)
    .
    M1 = 9: M2 = 6: M3 = 0
    CALL MOUSE(M1, M2, M3, VARPTR(Cursor(0, 0)))

    In addition to the above, note that Mouse function calls 21-23
    require dynamically allocated storage out of the home data segment.
    The recommended way to do this is to allocate space in a dynamic
    string variable based on the return value from function call 21,
    using the STRING$ or SPACE$ function. Then use VARPTR on this string
    variable just prior to calling Mouse function call 22 or 23.


    ================================================================================
    Part 3: Supplementary Information on Mixed-Language Programming
    ================================================================================


    Linking from Within QuickC or with QCL
    --------------------------------------

    Microsoft QuickC and the QCL command both set the /NOI linker
    by default. Therefore, you should not link from within QuickC, or
    with QCL, when your program contains modules written in a case-
    insensitive language such as BASIC. Use LINK to link your program
    from the command line.


    Pascal and FORTRAN Modules in QuickBASIC Programs
    -------------------------------------------------

    Modules compiled with Microsoft Pascal or FORTRAN can be linked with
    BASIC programs, as described in the Microsoft Mixed-Language
    Programming Guide. They can also be incorporated in Quick libraries.
    However, QuickBASIC programs containing code compiled with Microsoft
    Pascal must allocate at least 2K near-heap space for Pascal. This can
    be done by using the DIM statement to allocate a static array of 2K or
    greater in the NMALLOC named common block, for example, as follows:

    DIM name%(2048)
    COMMON SHARED /NMALLOC/name%()

    The Pascal run-time assumes it always has at least 2K of near-heap
    space available. If the Pascal code cannot allocate the required
    space, QuickBASIC may crash. This applies to Pascal code in Quick
    libraries as well as Pascal code linked into executable files. The
    situation is similar for FORTRAN I/O, which also requires near
    buffer space, and which can be provided by the same means as the
    Pascal near malloc space.


    STATIC Array Allocation
    -----------------------

    If you are writing assembly-language modules for use in QuickBASIC
    programs, see Section 2.3.3, "Variable Storage Allocation," in the
    BASIC Language Reference. Assembly-language code should not assume
    data is in a particular segment. To avoid problems, pass data using
    the SEG or CALLS keywords, or use FAR pointers. Alternatively, you
    can declare all arrays dynamic (still using far pointers) since
    dynamic arrays are handled identically by BC and within QuickBASIC.


    Quick Libraries with Leading Zeros in the First Code Segment
    ------------------------------------------------------------

    A Quick library containing leading zeros in the first CODE segment
    is invalid, causing the message "Error in loading file <name> -
    Invalid format" when you try to load it in QuickBASIC. For example,
    this can occur if an assembly-language routine puts data that is
    initialized to zero in the first CODE segment, and it is subsequently
    listed first on the LINK command line when you make a Quick library.
    If you have this problem, do either of the following:
    (1) link with a BASIC module first on the LINK command line, or
    (2) make sure that, in whatever module comes first on the LINK
    command line, the first code segment starts with a non-zero byte.


    References to DGROUP in Extended Run-Time Modules
    -------------------------------------------------

    For mixed-language programs that use the CHAIN command, you should
    make sure that any code built into an extended run-time module does not
    contain any references to DGROUP. (The CHAIN command causes DGROUP to
    move, but does not update references to DGROUP.) This rule applies
    only to mixed-language programs; because BASIC routines never refer
    to DGROUP, you can ignore this caution for programs written entirely
    in BASIC.

    To avoid this problem, you can use the value of SS, since BASIC always
    assumes that SS coincides with DGROUP.

    Part 4: Using Btrieve
    ================================================================================


    Using Btrieve in OS/2 Protected Mode
    ------------------------------------

    In OS/2 protected mode, a BASIC program that uses Btrieve must do a
    Btrieve reset call (function 28) before executing the CHAIN statement.
    The program must also reopen all Btrieve files when the destination of
    the CHAIN starts to run.


    Using Btrieve with QuickBASIC
    -----------------------------

    If you use Btrieve with QuickBASIC, you must make a small change to
    your programs for QuickBASIC Version 4.5. Currently your programs
    contain a statement that obtains the address of the field buffer for
    an open file. For example:

    OPEN "NUL" AS #1
    FIELD #1, 20 AS CITY$, 10 AS STATE$
    FCB.ADDR% = VARPTR(#1)	'This statement obtains the address

    In QuickBASIC Version 4.5, you should change the indicated statement
    to return the address of the first variable in your field buffer minus
    a constant, as follows:

    OPEN "NUL" AS #1
    FIELD #1, 20 AS CITY$, 10 AS STATE$
    FCB.ADDR% = SADD(CITY$) - 188	' CITY$ is the first field
                    ' buffer variable

    The following example shows how to obtain the same address for a
    user-defined type:

    TYPE ADDRESS
    CITY AS STRING * 20
    STATE AS STRING * 10
    END TYPE

    DIM ADD1 AS ADDRESS

    FCB.ADDR% = VARPTR(ADD1) - 188
    ' or, you can use FCB.ADDR% = VARPTR(ADD1.CITY) - 188

    Your programs should function correctly with Btrieve with this change.


    ================================================================================
    Part 5: DOS 3.20 Patch
    ================================================================================

    This information is important only if your system has all of the
    following characteristics:

    1. Uses MS-DOS version 3.20
    2. Boots from a hard disk drive
    3. Has a math coprocessor (for instance, an 8087 chip)
    4. Runs programs that use floating-point math

    For systems that satisfy all of the preceding conditions, you may be
    able to eliminate floating-point math problems by installing a small
    patch in DOS. If you are not sure whether you need the patch, perform
    the following steps:

    1. Copy the program PATCH87.EXE (included in this release) to the root
    directory of your hard-disk drive.

    2. Reboot your system from the hard disk, and do not perform any floppy-
    disk operations after rebooting. It is very important that you avoid
    floppy-disk I/O after rebooting, since that will affect the
    reliability of the diagnostic test that you are about to perform.

    3. If necessary, use the CD command to move to the root directory of
    your hard-disk drive.

    4. Run the PATCH87.EXE program by entering this command at the DOS
    prompt:

    PATCH87

    5. The program performs a diagnostic test on your system to determine
    whether it needs the DOS patch, and if the patch is needed,
    whether the patch can be installed successfully. If the program
    tells you that you need to install the DOS patch, and that it can be
    done, follow the procedure described in the next section.

    Note: The floating-point problem has been eliminated in versions of
    MS-DOS higher than 3.20. This includes MS-DOS versions 3.21 and 3.30.

    If you performed the preceding test and determined that you should
    install the DOS patch on your system, perform the following steps:

    1. Format a blank floppy disk. (Do NOT use the /s formatting option to
    transfer system files to the disk.)

    2. Use the SYS command to copy IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS from the root
    directory of your hard disk to the new floppy disk. For instance, if
    you boot from drive C:, you would enter the following commands:

    C:
    SYS A:

    3. Use the COPY command to copy COMMAND.COM and SYS.COM to the same
    floppy disk.

    4. Use the COPY command to copy the program PATCH87.EXE (included in
    this release) to the same floppy disk.

    5. Change the current drive and directory to the floppy disk, by
    entering the following command:

    A:

    7. Install the DOS patch by entering the following command:

    PATCH87 /F

    WARNING: If you experience any disk errors during steps 2 through 7,
    do not proceed with step 8. Reboot from your hard disk and repeat the
    entire process.

    8. If you have not experienced any errors, use the SYS command to
    transfer the files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS from the floppy disk back to
    your hard disk. For instance, if the boot directory of your system
    is the root directory of drive C:, you would enter the following
    command at the DOS prompt:

    A:
    SYS C:

    9. The DOS patch has been installed. Reboot the system.

    Part 6: Miscellaneous Information About Using QuickBASIC
    ================================================================================


    Using FIXSHIFT.COM Utility
    --------------------------

    Some keyboards have an extra set of DIRECTION (i.e. arrow) keys, in
    addition to those on the numeric keypad. A bug in the ROM BIOS of
    some machines with these keyboards can interfere with the QuickBASIC
    editor. The Utilities 2 disk includes a program, FIXSHIFT.COM, that
    fixes this bug. If you have such a keyboard, run this program by typing
    FIXSHIFT. If your machine does not have the bug, FIXSHIFT displays a
    message telling you so. Otherwise FIXSHIFT prompts you for the proper
    actions. FIXSHIFT takes about 450 bytes of memory. Except for the BIOS
    bug, it has no effect on other programs you run.


    Note on VGA Display Adapters
    ----------------------------

    If you install an IBM (R) Personal System/2 (TM) Video Graphics
    Array display adapter (VGA) in a non-PS/2 machine, the VGA adapter
    should be the only adapter in the system, and you should not use
    monochrome modes (SCREEN 10) if you have a color monitor. Similarly,
    you should not use color modes (SCREEN 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13) if
    you have a monochrome monitor.


    Note on Using QuickBASIC with DOS 2.1
    -------------------------------------

    To use QuickBASIC with a two-floppy system under DOS 2.1, you must
    put a copy of COMMAND.COM on each disk containing an executable
    file ( a file with the .EXE extension).


    PTR86, LOF, Naming SUB Procedures and Variables
    -----------------------------------------------

    PTR86 is no longer supported. Use VARSEG and VARPTR instead.
    Also, when used with a communications device, LOF now returns the
    amount of space remaining (in bytes) in the output buffer. In
    previous versions this was returned in the input buffer. Also, note
    that a variable and SUB procedure could have the same name in
    previous versions. In Version 4.5, this causes a "Duplicate
    definition" error message.
