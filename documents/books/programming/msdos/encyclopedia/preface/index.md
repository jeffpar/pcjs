### Preface

{% raw %}

    In the space of six years, MS-DOS has become the most widely used
    computer operating system in the world, running on more than 10
    million machines. It has grown, matured, and stabilized into a
    flexible, easily extendable system that can support networking,
    graphical user interfaces, nearly any peripheral device, and even CD
    ROMs containing massive amounts of on-line information. MS-DOS will be
    with us for many years to come as the platform for applications that
    run on low-cost, 8086/8088-based machines.
    
    Not surprisingly, the success of MS-DOS has drawn many writers
    and publishers into its orbit. The number of books on MS-DOS and its
    commands, languages, and applications dwarfs the list of titles for
    any other operating system. Why, then, yet another book on MS-DOS? And
    what can we say about the operating system that has not been said
    already?
    
    First, we have written and edited The MS-DOS Encyclopedia with one
    audience in mind: the community of working programmers. We have
    therefore been free to bypass elementary subjects such as the number
    of bits in a byte and the interpretation of hexadecimal numbers.
    Instead, we have emphasized detailed technical explanations, working
    code examples that can be adapted and incorporated into new
    applications, and a systems view of even the most common MS-DOS
    commands and utilities.
    
    Second, because we were not subject to size restrictions, we have
    explored topics in depth that other MS-DOS books mention only briefly,
    such as exception and error handling, interrupt-driven communications,
    debugging strategies, memory management, and installable device
    drivers. We have commissioned definitive articles on the relocatable
    object modules generated by Microsoft language translators, the
    operation of the Microsoft Object Linker, and terminate-and-stay-
    resident utilities. We have even interviewed the key developers of
    MS-DOS and drawn on their files and bulletin boards to offer an
    entertaining, illustrated account of the origins of Microsoft's
    standard-setting operating system.
    
    Finally, by combining the viewpoints and experience of non-
    Microsoft programmers and writers, the expertise and resources of
    Microsoft software developers, and the publishing know-how of
    Microsoft Press, we have assembled a unique and comprehensive
    reference to MS-DOS services, commands, directives, and utilities. In
    many instances, the manuscripts have been reviewed by the authors of
    the Microsoft tools described.
    
    We have made every effort during the creation of this book to
    ensure that its contents are timely and trustworthy. In a work of this
    size, however, it is inevitable that errors and omissions will occur.
    If you discover any such errors, please bring them to our attention so
    that they can be repaired in future printings and thus aid your fellow
    programmers. To this end, Microsoft Press has established a bulletin
    board on MCI Mail for posting corrections and comments. Please refer
    to page xvi for more information.
